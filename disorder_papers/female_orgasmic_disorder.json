      "abstract": "Les troubles sexuels sont nettement plus frequents chez les personnes epileptiques que dans la population generale. Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

      "abstract": "Out of the two functions constituting male sexual functions, the reproductive and the coital one, the author has made a clinical study on the latter, that is, insufficiency and impotence in the narrow sense, which has hitherto been paid little scientific attention to. The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

Arousal disorders can be associated with physical factors (eg, vaginal dryness) or psychological factors (eg, anxiety, distraction), or a combination of both. The most common complaint is the absence of subjective sexual excitement or pleasure despite adequate physical arousal (eg, lubrication).

The effect on sexual function is not normally discovered until later, often during the postoperative period, some considerable time after the onset of neurological and/or urogenital symptoms. There are few reports concerning sexual problems in CES, yet they are very common in both men and women. Loss of feeling is a significant source of sexual dissatisfaction, particularly in women. The most frequent sexual disorders reported by men are reduction in orgasm and erectile dysfunction. Ejaculatory disorders are less common. Sexual problems are often accompanied by urinary symptoms. Women most often report reduced or absent lubrication and significantly diminished libido and orgasm, often associated with local pain. Sexual dysfunction in CES is permanent and often incurable. A global approach to treatment is needed, particularly where the population suffers little motor disability and wishes to regain sexual function.",

      "title": "The Expression of Intimacy and Sexuality in Persons With Dementia",
      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

The syndrome is precisely the opposite of female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), in that the woman's complaint is of excessive and often unremitting arousal rather than of deficient or absent arousal. Five case descriptions are reported, highlighting the essential feature of the syndrome−persistent physiological arousal in the absence of conscious feelings of sexual desire. To date, no obvious hormonal, vascular, neurological, or psychological causes have been identified as underlying the symptoms of any of these patients. The cases are presented in the hope that they will stimulate efforts to investigate the prevalence, etiology, course, and management of PSAS.",

Sexual dysfunction is a significant, but often underestimated, symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting 50–90% of men and 40–80% of women. The types of sexual dysfunction can be categorized in terms of the normal sexual response cycle: sexual interest/desire dysfunction (reduced libido), sexual arousal dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction) and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may not only be due to lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiological function (primary dysfunction), but also result from general physical disabilities (secondary dysfunction) or psychological and emotional issues (tertiary dysfunction). Comprehensive management should address all these possible contributing problems. Specific pharmacotherapy is only currently available for erectile dysfunction. This review summarizes the available information about sexual dysfunction in men and women with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4.

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

The excitement is not linked to sexual desire and may also be triggered by non sexual stimuli, as mere vibrations; moreover it cannot find a way out in an orgasm, which often proves unsatisfactory. Causes that may contribute to increase female sexual activity, be it egosyntonic or egodistonic, pleasant or disturbing for the couple, are still not appropriately investigated (Leiblum, Graziottin, 2007).",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The pathogenesis of delayed ejaculation (DE) is rather unknown, though the contribution of various psychological, marital, hormonal, and neurological factors has been advocated. In this study we systematically investigated the relative relevance of the aforementioned factors in 1632 men who were seeking medical help for sexual dysfunction. The severity of DE was classified according to Kaplan criteria. Mild and moderate forms of DE (MMDE) recognized different risk factors than the most severe ones (anejaculation or severe DE [ASDE]). ASDE was essentially coupled with the presence of neurological diseases or with the use of serotoninergic drugs. Serotoninergic drugs also significantly increase (by at least 10‐fold) the risk for MMDE, which, however, was also coupled with other relational factors (eg, partner's impaired climax, patient's hypoactive sexual desire [HSD]) or intrapsychic factors (eg, stress at work). At multiple regression analysis, some organic pathological conditions (such as psychiatric disorders and hypogonadism) were also associated with MMDE. In particular, hypogonadism retained significance for DE even after adjustment for HSD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08 [1.11–3.89]; P &lt; .05), suggesting other effects of testosterone deficiency on the ejaculatory reflex besides reduced libido. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that multiple psychobiological determinants are associated with DE, a still obscure condition that substantially impairs psychosexual equilibrium of the couple.",

      "abstract": "In the United States, approximately 1 in 5 women will experience a sexual assault in her lifetime. In most reported cases, men are identified as perpetrators regardless of the sex of the individual assaulted. There typically is some form of relationship between the survivor and the perpetrator-whether it be an acquaintance, friend, family member, or authority figure. As such, female patients should be asked routinely about a history of sexual assault, particularly if the patient reports relevant physical symptoms and/or substance abuse. Factors that could lead to children experiencing sexual assault (particularly via domestic minor sex trafficking) include a history of abuse, substance use, mental health issues, family dysfunction, and the involvement of Child Protective Services. Short-term goals of primary care include management of physical injuries and psychological needs, evaluation for pregnancy, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections. Long-term effects may include sexual dysfunction, mental disorders (eg, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder), and medical symptoms (eg, chronic headache, infections).",

Both abnormal (paraphilic) and conventional (nonparaphilic) forms of sexual behavior are usually included in the definition. CSB is reported to affect 3% to 6% of the general population in the United States, occurring more frequently in men. It typically begins in the late teens or early twenties and is chronic or intermittent. The disorder has been described as a progression through four stages: preoccupation, ritualization, gratification, and despair. Men with CSB typically focus on physical sexual gratification; women focus on romantic or emotional aspects of sexuality. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use, mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. CSB can lead to medical complications. Risk factors are thought to include family history and childhood abuse.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "abstract": "Summary: Sexual dysfunction may arise more frequently in men and women with epilepsy than with other chronic illnesses, manifesting primarily as diminished sexual desire and potency. Studies using retrospective self‐report of sexual attitude and behavior find an incidence of sexual dysfunction ranging from 14–66%. Sexual dysfunction may be more common in partial than in generalized epilepsies. Sexual dysfunction in epilepsy may result from a disturbance in social or psychological factors affecting sexual responsiveness. Alternatively, epileptiform discharges may disrupt the function of structures mediating sexual behavior, particularly the limbic cortex, or alter the release of hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. Antiepileptic drugs modulate hormone release from the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis and may have direct inhibitory effects on sexual behavior. Evidence both supports and refutes each of these etiologies in the sexual dysfunction seen with epilepsy. Specific evaluation and treatment protocols for patients with sexual dysfunction are available.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other.

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "abstract": "A atividade sexual satisfatória é um dos pilares da qualidade de vida, envolvendo das preliminares ao intercurso sexual, mecanismos neurológicos, vasculares, endocrinológicos, musculoesqueléticos, psicossociais, culturais, além do parceiro sexual e fatores individuais (autoestima, imagem corporal e habilidade pessoal). A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous orgasm is characterized by a spontaneous onset of orgasm without any preceding sexual or nonsexual trigger. It sheds insight on the mechanisms underlying orgasms and the sexual response cycle in humans.We report a male patient of repetitive spontaneous orgasm under trazodone treatment and systematically review the literature on drug-associated spontaneous orgasm (DASO).A total of 25 patients (18 women and 7 men), including our reported case, experienced 27 DASO events. Over half of them were under 50 years of age during the DASO event. Depression was the leading morbidity for these patients, and a limited list of antidepressants and antipsychotics were involved in 92.5% of all DASO events. Although offending drugs possess variable pharmacological properties, their common effect is an augmentation of serotonin-1A (5HT1A) neurotransmission. Offending drugs seemingly increase personal susceptibility to DASO. Over half of the patients, especially men, did not concurrently experience sexual arousal or desire during the DASO event. In the remaining patients, the orgasm was accompanied by or ensued with arousal or desire. A reduction of dose or discontinuation of the offending drug usually abolished DASO.It appears that 5HT1A has a key role in generating orgasm. Orgasms may be activated through arousal-independent or arousal-dependent pathways, and both orgasms and sexual arousal are bidirectionally activated. This double-bidirectional model of sexual response cycle may promote the success of sexual procreation and recreation, and further research on this pathway could offer an innovative method to manage anorgasmia in the future.",

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "abstract": "Most women of reproductive age (about 80%) experience premenstrual symptoms, which indicate the approaching menstruation and are of little clinical significance, since they do not affect the quality of life. However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

Obesity and smoking have also been identified as risk factors.

Though several theories have been propounded, the exact cause of premenstrual syndrome is unknown.

      "abstract": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) comprises about 5% of ad cases and is associated with delays in diagnosis and aggressive course. Psychotic symptoms are frequent in ad and often include delusions of infidelity and hallucinations. When present, ad with psychosis is accompanied by elevated levels of depression and greater functional impairment. This case expands upon the existing literature on EOAD through the timeline of a complex psychosis presentation accompanied by rapid cognitive decline.63-year-old, Hispanic, woman with progressive cognitive changes (e.g., confusion, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, disorganization) that emerged 5 years prior to seeking neurological consultation. Psychosis symptoms (i.e., auditory/visual hallucinations, delusions), in the context of real events (i.e., husband's previous infidelity), developed simultaneously. These pervasive symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal, persistent suicidal tendencies, and impaired IADLs. Neuroimaging suggested hypometabolism in the parietotemporal regions with precuneus and posterior cingulate gyri involvement.The evaluation revealed fairly generalized cognitive decline. Basic attention, working memory, visual abstract reasoning, and phonemic fluency were intact. Visual integration/visuoconstruction were reduced. Impairments emerged in processing speed, rapid cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition, conceptualization, visuospatial orientation, semantic fluency, confrontation naming, and visual and verbal encoding and retention (with rapid forgetting). She endorsed moderately elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety.The pattern of cognitive and functional deficits are all suggestive of an ad process. Her age, sex, significant neuroimaging findings, report of earliest cognitive symptoms, and family history reinforce an EOAD etiology. Significant behavioral changes are often associated with increased cognitive impairment and in turn, may mark the progression/stage of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Positional asphyxia is a type of asphyxia where the position of an individual compromises the ability to breathe. It is commonly caused by accidents due to alcohol or drug intoxication, diseases, and/or being in a confined space. In this study, the authors reviewed autopsy cases at their institute over the past 5 years where positional asphyxia is suspected as a contributing factor or cause of death. The autopsy cases (n=24) were divided into three groups: positional asphyxia was the cause of death (n=15); unknown cause of death but positional asphyxia was considered (n=4); and positional asphyxia was suspected to be a contributing factor (n=5). All cases of group A included postures that could interfere with breathing, but the typical jackknife or head-down postures were seen in approximately half of the cases; “classic signs of asphyxia” were also observed in approximately half of the cases. They shared features such as high blood alcohol concentration, therapeutic levels of drugs, various disease, minor head trauma, and morbid obesity; however, no definite diagnostic criteria have been established for forensic practice. Positional asphyxia is a form of mechanical asphyxia which must be differentiated from traumatic asphyxia. In addition to a complete autopsy, thorough laboratory tests and understanding of the circumstances of the case and the situation at the death scene are required for diagnosis. Special attention is required for the diagnosis of special types of positional asphyxia such as death during institutional restraint or prone restraint.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

For such problems to be diagnosed as a sexual dysfunction, the concerns need to be further identified as personally distressing. The DSM-5 recognizes seven sexual problems: female interest/arousal disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, erectile disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Although individuals may present with a range of sexual problems, DSM-5 recognizes only three major categories of sexual dysfunction: interest/arousal, orgasm, and pain. This chapter reviews each sexual dysfunction, with a specific focus on the diagnostic criteria and prevalence rates, as well as known psychological and biological etiological factors.",

Overview of Sexual Dysfunction in WomenSexual dysfunction can refer to difficulties in libido (sex drive), arousal, or orgasm.There are many causes of sexual dysfunction.Psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety or emotional distress from work or relationship stressors are common causes.Some medical conditions can also affect sexual function, such as heart disease, certain neurological conditions, arthritis, or hormone changes during menopause.Medications, especially antidepressants, can also cause sexual dysfunction.Addressing the underlying medical or psychological issues improves sexual function in most women.However, some women who have no other medical or psychological concerns still have low sexual desire that affects both their personal and relationship well-being.This condition is referred to as female sexual interest/arousal disorder.This is a new diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), which combined the previously separate disorders of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and female sexual arousal disorder.The prevalence of these disorders varies widely depending on the population surveyed, but studies have suggested it can range anywhere from 5% to 15% of women.Treatment of HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder can be challenging.",

ED can be distinguished as a pure psychogenic, organic and mixed disorder (4) .Potency is the ability to attain and maintain a functional /rigid erection and is best characterized by axial rigidity rather than hemodynamic parameter (5-7). Some clinical studies have shown that potency is not always associated with normal hemodynamics or vice-versa Therefore other factors may also be responsible for rigid erection. This disparity between penile rigidity and hemodynamic erectile response is because of expandability of erectile tissue as described by Udelson et al -(6-8) . Thus Impotence may occur in some patient solely on the basis of abnormal penile tissue property despite normal hemodynamics.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

Patients complaining of this disorder are found to have significant organic lesions in only ten per cent of instances. Discussion of these lesions then follows, and there is sly humor that the first of these is absence of the penis. I found the exposition of the functional causes less satisfying, less clear, based on \"common sense,\" and at times almost antipsychiatric. All who deal with this problem agree that \"sexuality among humans... is a very complicated psychocultural performance.\" The physician's apostolic function must be utilized to the fullest. However, as fever may be indicative of a simple abscess or metastatic dissemination of a malignancy, so the doctor must determine whether sexual impotence arises from ignorance of sexual matters, etc., or from a concealed psychiatric disturbance.

PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12.

The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome is unknown. However, in about 70% of patients, a recent infection or vaccine or surgery serves as a trigger to an autoimmune response. The first symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome include: • Progressive muscle weakness on both sides of the legs, arms, and face. • Prickly, tingling sensations, usually in the feet or hands. • Pain is a significant complaint. • Loss of normal reflexes. Symptoms may develop over a period of hours, days, or weeks. They will vary in severity from minimal to total paralysis including respiratory weakness. The symptoms grow progressively worse. Most patients recover fully, but as many as 25% will have some residual symptoms. Five to ten percent have permanent, disabling deficits, and for 5% the condition is fatal. Diagnosis is dependant on the physical exam and history, cerebrospinal fluid findings, and nerve conduction studies. Intravenous infusion with immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis may help reduce the severity of a Guillain-Barre attack.",

We present 4 cases, one each of primary and secondary amenorrhea, MMR, and MP, respectively. In the first 3 cases (2 amenorrhea and 1 MMR), we found psychogenic factors: an insult to feminine development after rape (case 1) or marriage problems (cases 2 and 3). In the case of a recurrent MP, no relevant psychological etiology was found. Furthermore, some of the patient's relatives had menstrual or peripartum psychiatric disorders. Menstrual disorders' etiology can be psychogenic or hormonal. The correct etiology is the guide for the adequate therapeutic way: psychotherapy based in psychogenic disorders and neuroleptic or antiovulatory drugs in those of biological etiology.",

Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Ejaculatory/orgasmic disorders are common male sexual dysfunctions, and include premature ejaculation (PE), inhibited ejaculation, anejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, and anorgasmia.Premature ejaculation management is largely dependent upon aetiology. Life-long PE is best managed with PE pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor [SSRI] and/or topical anaesthetics). The management of acquired PE is aetiology-specific and may include erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy in men with co-morbid ED. Behavioural therapy is indicated when psychogenic or relationship factors are present and is often best combined with PE pharmacotherapy in an integrated treatment programme. Delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, and/or anorgasmia may have a biogenic and/or psychogenic aetiology. Men with age-related penile hypoanesthesia should be educated, reassured, and instructed in revised sexual techniques which maximize arousal. No drugs have yet been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side effects, or are considered experimental in nature.",

Nymphomania can be defined in terms of three distinct elements: marked increase in sexual drive; extremely frequent partner sexual behavior; promiscuity. The essence of the problem, however, is the disruptive increase in desire. Causes often involve one or more of the following: acting out; atypical psychoses; alcohol and/or drug abuse; temporal lobe disorders; involvement with an inappropriate partner; response to another sexual dysfunction. Many of these women are unable to derive emotional satisfaction from sex.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo.

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

      "abstract": "Many women in their reproductive years experience some mood, behavioral. or physical symptoms in the week prior to menses. Variability exists in the level of symptom burden in that some women experience mild symptoms, whereas a small minority experience severe and debilitating symptoms. For an estimated 5%–8% of premenopausal women, work or social functioning are affected by severe premenstrual syndrome. Many women in this group meet diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Among women who suffer from PMDD, mood and behavioral symptoms such as irritability, depressed mood, tension, and labile mood dominate. Somatic complaints, including breast tenderness and bloating, also can prove disruptive to women's overall functioning and quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that individual sensitivity to cyclical variations in levels of gonadal hormones may predispose certain women to experience these mood, behavioral, and somatic symptoms. Treatments include: antidepressants of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, taken intermittently or throughout the menstrual cycle; medications that suppress ovarian cyclicity; and newer oral contraceptives with novel progestins.",

      "title": "Eating disorders and sexual function",
      "abstract": "Women suffering from eating disorders, present considerable retardation and difficulties in their psychosexual development during adolescence. This leads to primary or secondary insufficiencies in their adult sexual life. The cause of these difficulties seems to be a series of biological, family and psychosocial factors. The majority of the research findings indicate that eating disorders have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The factors related to eating disorders symptomatology that influence sexuality are various and differ among each eating disorder diagnostic categories. Considering anorexia nervosa, it has been reported that women have negative attitudes to sexual issues and their body. Their sexual motivation increases when they engage in psychotherapy and their body weight is gradually restored. Starvation and its consequences on the human physiology and especially on the brain function seem to be the main factor that leads to reduced sexual desire and scarce sexual activity. Moreover, personality traits that are common in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa such as compulsivity and rigidity are also related with difficulties initiating and retaining romantic and sexual relationships. Usually patients suffering from anorexia nervosa report impaired sexual behavior and lack of interest to engage in a sexual relationship. Considering Bulimia Nervosa, impulsivity and difficulties in emotion regulation that are common features of the individuals that suffer from bulimia nervosa are also related to impulsive and sometimes self-harming sexual behaviors. Moreover women sufferers often report repulsion, anger and shame towards their body and weight, mainly due to the distorted perception that they are fat and ugly. It is interesting that a number of research findings indicate that although patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are more sexually active and have more sexual experiences than patients suffering from anorexia nervosa, both groups of patients report more often than general population a lack of satisfaction from their sexual experiences. Other factors that are common to eating disorders and sexual dysfunction are personality traits, negative body-image, adverse childhood experiences, negative family climate and especially early traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, comorbidity of eating disorders with depression may have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The treatment and improvement of sexual behavior is quite problematic when the patient is also suffering from an eating disorder. Eating Disorder patients are often very reluctant to discuss their sexual life with the therapist and to engage in any kind of therapeutic intervention. Comorbidity with a number of other disorders makes psychotherapy even more difficult for those patients. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of Anorexia Nervosa patients do not have any kind of sexual activity, at least until nutrition and weight are restored.",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium.

The advancing multimodal therapies, while significantly improving the morbidity and mortality, have limited impact on psychopathologies, which often persist despite disease remission. The most common psychopathologies in acromegaly include depression, anxiety and affective disorders, together with sexual dysfunction, which may be considered as either a consequence or potentially even a contributory factor to these psychopathologies. Approximately one-third of patients with acromegaly manifest depression, whereas two-thirds of patients display anxiety, with both conditions tending to be more prevalent and severe in younger patients with shorter duration of disease. Apparently, a major impact of psychological discomfort in women compared with men appears to be the fact that women tend to internalize whereas men tend to externalize their distress. Personality disorders also commonly associated with acromegaly, especially due to body image suffering, are linked to sexual dysfunction, which seems to affect women more than men. In summary, psychopathology in acromegaly is a major determinant of the quality of life and a complex array of psychological abnormalities are associated with acromegaly.",

Sexual dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia\nseems to be associated with the disease itself, psychosocial factors, medical health, as well as to the use of\nantypsychotics. Many of the conventional or typical antipsychotics have been associated with sexual dysfunction,\nsuch as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, delayed or retrograde ejaculation, oligomenorrhoea, and\namenorrhoea. The contemporary literature hardly gives any information on systematic studies on the frequency and\nquality of sexual functioning in patients with schizophrenia. The limited information available suggests that some\nantipsychotics often induce sexual side effects and comparative studies are almost completely absent. The underlying\nmechanisms of sexual side effects induced by antipsychotics are only partly known. Several mechanisms contribute to\nthe effects of antipsychotics on sexual functioning. Dopamine seems to be involved in almost all aspects of sexual\nbehaviour and antipsychotics induced dopamine blockade playing a role in the impairment of all stages of sexual\nperformance. The prolactin elevation associated with dopamine blockade interferes with erection as well as with\nother aspects of sexual performance in a dose dependent manner. Also some antipsychotics induce noradrenergic\nblockade, which is associated with disturbances in ejaculation and possibly lubrication. In addition serotonergic,\nhistaminergic and hormonal effects contribute to the actual sexual performance. The aim of this paper is to depict the\nmechanisms underlying the sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic treatment.",

      "title": "A Case of Major Depressive Disorder and Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Responding to Escitalopram",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

      "title": "Il desiderio sessuale ipoattivo nell'uomo: il ruolo dell'andrologo",
      "abstract": "Il DSM-IV definisce il disturbo da desiderio sessuale ipoattivo(DDSI) come una persistente o ricorrente carenza (o assenza) di fantasie sessuali e desiderio per attivita sessuale causa di disagio o difficolta interpersonali. Il testosterone (T) e la prolattina (PRL) sono i piu importanti\r\nfattori ormonali implicati nel controllo del desiderio sessuale. In quest’articolo descriviamo come altri fattori psico-biologici, individuati attraverso l’utilizzo dell’intervista strutturata SIEDY, siano associati al DDSI in un campione di pazienti maschi che si rivolgono ad un ambulatorio andrologico riportando un disturbo della sessualita. Diversi fattori relazionali (riduzione della capacita orgasmica e libidica della partner come percepita dal paziente, presenza di malattie nella partner, relazioni prolungate e conflittuali) e stressogeni ambientali\r\n(soddisfazione sul lavoro e/o presenza di conflittualita familiare) sono risultati significativamente associati con il DDSI. Tra i fattori ormonali, una iperprolattinemia severa (>700 mU/l), sembra giocare un ruolo maggiore rispetto all’ipogonadismo (testosterone < 12 nM) sulla\r\npatogenesi del DDSI (RR= 7.5 [2.5-22.4] vs 1.5 [1.1-1.9], rispettivamente). La presenza di disturbi psichiatrici maggiori o l’utilizzo di farmaci con impatto potenzialmente negativo sulla funzione sessuale sono altri parametri associati al DDSI cosi come la presenza di sintomi\r\nd’ansia e depressivi. In conclusione, il DDSI e associato a diversi fattori organici, intrapsichici e relazionali che possono essere simultaneamente individuati attraverso l’utilizzo di SIEDY.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled sexual thoughts, urges, or behaviors, and was first described over 100 years ago. Although there is little consensus about definition or classification, CSB is generally thought to involve both paraphilic (e.g., pedophilia, voyeurism) and nonparaphilic (e.g., compulsive masturbation) forms. CSB has been estimated to affect as much as 5% of the United States population; 80%-90% of those with CSB are male. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic or episodic. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use and mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Developmental, behavioral, neurobiologic, and sociocultural mechanisms probably play a role in the etiology of CSB and its expression. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs may be helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their sexual impulses, while anti-androgens may be helpful in sexually aggressive forms of CSB.",

Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer. Das zeigt auch die hohe Suizidrate Älterer, die ab dem 65. Lebensjahr drastisch ansteigt.",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "The sexual dysfunctions are extremely common but are rarely recognized by primary care physicians. They represent inhibitions in the appetitive or psychophysiologic changes that characterize the complete adult sexual response and are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion disorder), (2) sexual arousal disorders (female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile dysfunction), (3) orgasmic disorders (inhibited male or female orgasm, premature ejaculation), and (4) sexual pain disorders (dyspareunia, vaginismus).Articles about the sexual dysfunctions were obtained from a search of MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present using the categories as key words, along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction.\" Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.Cause and pathogenesis span a continuum from organic to psychogenic and most often include a mosaic of factors. Organic factors include chronic illness, pregnancy, pharmacologic agents, endocrine alterations, and a host of other medical, surgical, and traumatic factors. Psychogenic factors include an array of individual factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, guilt hypochondria, intrapsychic conflict), interpersonal and relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship conflict, diminished trust, fear of intimacy, poor relationship models, family system conflict), psychosexual factors (e.g., negative learning and attitudes, performance anxiety, prior sexual trauma, restrictive religiosity, intellectual defenses), and sexual enactment factors (e.g., skill and knowledge deficits, unrealistic performance expectations). Understanding the cause and pathophysiology of sexual disorders will help primary care physicians diagnose these problems accurately and manage them effectively.",

In addition there are several times as many unsuccessful suicide attempts and attempted homicides, mayhems, and serious assaults and batteries. It is safe to say that a large portion of these involve persons with psychiatric disorders and thus fall under medical jurisdiction. Some of these individuals are overtly psychotic: deluded and hallucinated, or uncontrollably depressed, or assailed by intolerable anxiety, guilt, or hostile feelings. More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy. Frequent accompaniments are adolescent turmoil, marital discord, school or work problems, chronic or terminal illness, or geriatric disease. Thus the physician has usually been consulted before",

Prevalence estimates of dyspareunia ranged from 0.4 to 61% in one recent systematic review [1], and there is considerable evidence to suggest that these varying rates reflect the inconsistency of dyspareunia definitions as well as differences in study design and measurement [1–3]. Women with dyspareunia, in general, suffer negative impacts in psychosocial and sexual areas of their lives [4]. Despite the common clinical complaint of dyspareunia, there is still limited knowledge regarding its etiology and effective treatment strategies. The lack of knowledge surrounding this multifaceted condition only serves to increase the difficulty inherent in its assessment and management.",

One of the most common anxiety disorders observed in general medical practice and in the general population is the generalized anxiety disorder. In about 85% of cases, generalized anxiety does not appear alone, but is accompanied by other psychological problems, of which the most common are: depression, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, digestive problems, etc. The patient diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) usually has suffered from severe anxiety and worries about several different areas of their life for at least six months. It occurs in 5-9% of the population, and the incidence is twice as high in women as in men. Generalized anxiety usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood. GAG is caused by several factors: 30%-50% of it can be genetic in nature, but it also can be caused by experiences during childhood, recent stressful life events, unrealistic expectations about others and oneself, conflicts in relationships, alcohol consumption, coping skills and other factors (Ciubara et al., 2018). Studies show that the anxiety levels in the general population have risen over the past 50 years - probably due to declining social cohesion affecting communities, unrealistic expectations for quality of life, excessive focus on negative news, and other factors, social and cultural aspects.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

The most frequently reported symptoms include low sexual desire (40–55%), poor lubrication (25–30%) and dyspareunia (12–45%), one of the complications of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Declining levels of sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) play a major role in the impairment of sexual response; however, psychological and relational changes related with aging and an increase in metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities should also be taken into account. Although first-line therapeutic strategies for menopause-related sexual dysfunction aim at addressing modifiable factors, many hormonal and non-hormonal, local and systemic treatment options are currently available. Treatment should be individualized, taking into account the severity of symptoms, potential adverse effects and personal preferences.",

      "title": "Genetic Principles in the Classification of Affective Illnesses",
      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional live; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.Although symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from moodiness in the 18th century to premenstrual tension in the early part of 19th century to finally premenstrual in the 1950s. While some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, syndrome (PMS) includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD), now known as dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment.Currently, PMDD is listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the criteria for diagnosis as follows:Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge” Marked affective lability Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, school, friends, and hobbies) Subjective sense of difficulty in concentrating Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or scholastic functioning.Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed on those of these disorders).Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life detriments, work-productivity losses, and incur greater healthcare costs than women with no or only mild symptoms.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

From adolescence, women have a 1.5-3 times higher risk than men of suffering different depressive disorders. Traditionally, it has been assumed that transition to menopause, or perimenopause, is a period of higher depressive vulnerability, although there is some degree of controversy. This period seems to be associated with the appearance of both depressive symptoms and de novo depressive disorders, particularly if a background of depression exists. With regard to its etiopathogeny, genetic, hormonal, psychological and sociocultural factors have been suggested, but there are no solid data that support any of these explanations. Treatment basically depends on the severity of the disorder and includes antidepressants and/or psychotherapy. Maintained treatment with hormone replacement therapy (estrogens) is under discussion.",

Healthcare providers have also increasingly appreciated the impact that adverse effects of treatment can have on quality of life, as well as on compliance with and the effectiveness of treatment. Many functional impairments and adverse treatment effects take the form of clinical complaints that patients and caregivers typically report to their healthcare providers without prompting. Other adverse effects are not so obviously clinical or treatment-related, and patients may not be inclined or may even be reluctant to bring them up when talking with the provider. Impairment of sexual function is a problem of this kind. Sexual dysfunction appears to be common and frequently underrecognized in certain patient populations. For example, it has been estimated that 25% to 63% of women and 10% to 52% of men with epilepsy have some form of sexual dysfunction, yet in clinical reviews of sexual disorders, epilepsy is not listed as one of the medical conditions commonly associated with impaired sexual function.",

      "title": "ABC of psychological medicine: Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

Although many studies have been published on the subject, only some used a validated sexual function rating scale and most lacked either a baseline or placebo control or both. In addition, many of the studies on sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic medication are limited by other methodological flaws. However, there is consistent evidence to suggest that a large number of antipsychotic drugs adversely affect one or more of the 3 phases of sexual response (desire, arousal and orgasm). Among the antipsychotics, the so called \"prolactin-raising\" are probably most associated with sexual dysfunction, even if further studies to confirm this are needed: the reviewed literature shows no consistent evidence that any one antipsychotic drug has a significantly superior side effect profile over another and current information on this topic is often based on methodologically weak research. Clinicians must be aware of drug-induced sexual dysfunction, since its presence can have important consequences for clinical management and compliance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Multiple psychosocial and health-related factors and prior exposures are associated with risk for clinical depression, anxiety, and negative mood symptoms and syndromes in women of all ages. These include low socioeconomic status, life stressors, inadequate social support, vulnerable personality traits, medical conditions, vasomotor symptoms, psychiatric history, health history, reproductive-related factors, childhood abuse and family history and genetics. Few are specific or unique to psychiatric morbidity during the menopausal transition. Those that may be more prevalent or limiting during this period of life than prior to it include vasomo-tor symptoms, life stressors, and increased physical problems. The extent to which the physical and biological changes during the transition make women more vulnerable to the effects of factors such as low social support, a tendency to ruminate, or a history of childhood abuse are not known.",

      "abstract": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was introduced in the mood disorders section of DSM-5. Its primary symptoms are \"severe, recurrent temper outbursts\" (manifested verbally and/or physically) superimposed on and associated with chronic irritability. DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sexual sadistic and masochistic disorders fall into the paraphilic disorders according to the DSM-5 classification. Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

Although sexual dysfunction is a neglected area of quality of life in patients with SSc, it turns out that it is an important issue for both men and women characterized by high prevalence. The etiology of sexual dysfunction in systemic sclerosis is multifactorial and includes factors associated with both physical and emotional (psychological) status. The most common physical problems in women are vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and vaginal tightness. Erectile dysfunction is not only a frequent but also often underestimated clinical symptom in men with SSc. The incidence of erectile dysfunction in patients with SSc ranged from 12 to 81% in different studies. The main psychological factors that may affect sexuality are depression, fear, and changes in the appearance of the face and body that usually leads to impaired self-esteem. This chapter is a review about the impact of systemic sclerosis on sexual functioning.",

      "title": "Cambios en la psicopatología del trastorno limítrofe de la personalidad, en los pacientes tratados con psicoterapia psicodinámica",
      "abstract": "Summary There are very few studies on the changes in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) treated with psychodynamic psychotherapy, around the world, and as far as we know, this is the first report in Mexico on this subject. The main features of this disorder appear at 18 years of age (75% females; 25% males) and are frequent crises characterized by impulsivity (physical figths, substance abuse, suicide or selfmutilating behavior), affective instability (episodes of depression, anxiety and anger) and alterations in identity (sudden changes in values, vocational or laboral goals) that consume a lot of health resources and contribute to many failures in academic and work performance. Its treatment always needs some form of individual or group psychotherapy, with medication at times. In most of the clinical settings this disorder is considered as untractable or to take years to produce beneficial modifications. According to the epidemiological studies of several countries, this disorder appears in 1.1 to 4.6% in the general population, in 10% of the patients in ambulatory mental health centers, in 20% of the hospitalized psychiatric patients and in 30 to 60% of the patients with personality disorders. In a clinical psychiatric population in the Central Military Hospital (Mexico City) the prevalence was 35.7%. This paper reports changes observed in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder treated by therapists trained in the Kernberg’s manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy, delivered in two weekly 45 minutes sessions, videorecorded and supervised once a week by experts. As for the therapists that participated in the study, four were psychoanalysts with a mean experience of 12 years (D.E. = 1.15) and 10 psychotherapists with a mean experience of 4.67 years (D.E. = 4.23). The experience of both groups of therapists was significately different (U = 7.5, p,.002). Nineteen patients were treated: four males and 15 females who met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria. Measurements of the psychopathology and global functioning were made at the beginning of the treatment, and every 24 sessions during a two years period, using the Clarkin’s Dimensional Scale of the DSM IV Borderline Personality Disorder, and the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning. The results were: a) Eleven patients no longer met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria at the 72 nd session measurement, b) there was a positive change in the severity of the psychopathology in all criteria along time, c) the impulsivity criteria disappeared at the 24 th session evaluation; affective instability criteria almost disappeared at the 48 th session evaluation, while identity alterations criteria had only minimal changes even in those patients that remained in treatment for almost two years, d) the gaining in the Global Assessment of Functioning from the beginning to the 72 nd session measurement was 70% and, f) there were no significative differences between the type of therapist and the improvement of the patient in the measurements. These results should be replicated and contrasted with randomized and comparative studies between this type of therapy and supportive psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and medication in patients of other social classes treated by residents in psychiatry and clinical psychologists before making available this therapy to a wider patients population.",

One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail. These groups are compared with respect to libido and behavior involving erection, ejaculation, anxiety and avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem. With increasing age its prevalence and severity of its manifestations increase. Among nursing home residents the frequency is between 43 and 77 %, 6 to 10 % of all admissions to nursing homes are due to urinary incontinence. The risk for urinary incontinence among women with cognitive deficits is 1.5- to 3.4-fold higher than for women without mental disorders. The most common form is stress incontinence (50 %), followed by mixed stress-urge incontinence (40 %) and purely urge incontinence (OAB = overactive bladder, 20 %). With regard to its cause, the latter remains unclarified in about 80 % of the cases. It is often difficult to treat. There are also cases in which urge incontinence is related to traumatic events. In such cases behavioural and psychotherapeutic options may be helpful. Almost inevitably every form of incontinence has psychological consequences: shame and insecurity are often results of uncontrolled loss of urine. Among others, in the long term, they lead to the avoidance of social contacts and possibly to depression and isolation. Consideration of the psychosomatics is important in the therapy for female urinary incontinence from three points of view: 1) the efficacy of treatment is better suited to the patient, 2) the treatment costs are lower, 3) the professional satisfaction of the responsible physician increases.Harninkontinenz bei der Frau ist ein häufiges Problem. Mit dem Alter steigt ihre Prävalenz und die Schwere ihrer Ausprägung. Bei Bewohnerinnen von Pflegeheimen beträgt die Häufigkeit 43–77 %, 6–10 % der Heimeinweisungen erfolgen wegen Harninkontinenz. Das Risiko für eine Harninkontinenz ist bei Frauen mit kognitivem Defizit um den Faktor 1,5–3,5 erhöht gegenüber Frauen mit ungestörter mentaler Funktion. Die häufigste Harninkontinenz ist die Belastungsinkontinenz (50 %), gefolgt von der gemischten Belastungs-Drang-Inkontinenz (40 %) und der reinen Dranginkontinenz (ÜAB = überaktive Blase, 20 %). Letztere bleibt hinsichtlich ihrer Ursache in ca. 80 % der Fälle ungeklärt. Sie ist gelegentlich schwierig zu behandeln. Es gibt Fälle, in denen eine Dranginkontinenz im Zusammenhang steht mit traumatisierenden Ereignissen. Dann können zusätzliche verhaltenstherapeutische und psychotherapeutische Ansätze hilfreich sein. Fast zwangsläufig hat jede Form von Inkontinenz psychische Folgen: mit unkontrolliertem Urinverlust sind häufig Scham und Unsicherheit verbunden. Sie führen u. U. langfristig zur Vermeidung von sozialen Kontakten, und evtl. zu Depressivität und Vereinsamung. Unter 3 Gesichtspunkten ist die Berücksichtigung der Psychosomatik bei der Therapie der weiblichen Inkontinenz wichtig: 1. die Effizienz der Behandlung wird der Patientin besser gerecht, 2. die Kosten der Behandlung sinken, 3. die Arbeitszufriedenheit der behandelnden Ärzte und Ärztinnen steigt.",

Organic and surgical treatment should be considered cautiously and should have a clear indication. Frequent psychic causes are partnership or personality problems and the so-called vicious circle of performance anxiety. Sexual counselling is often all the therapy needed, especially when sexual knowledge is inadequate or when relative trivial partnership problems are involved. The kind of psychotherapy offered depends on the main problem: partner therapy, therapy directed at the control of personality problems, or therapy based on the Masters and Johnson method may be indicated.",

Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "title": "Female Sexual Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "In Brief Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction in women, and its prevalence peaks during midlife. Its etiology is complex and may include biologic, psychologic, and social elements. Major risk factors for its development include poor health status, depression, certain medications, dissatisfaction with partner relationship, and history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or both. Diagnosis is based on criteria set by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) and requires that a woman experience personal distress. Clinical evaluation should include medical history, sexual history, and, sometimes, a physical examination. Laboratory data are of limited value, except when warranted by history or physical examination. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic interventions such as education, office-based counseling, and psychotherapy. Although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for low desire, pharmacologic agents have been used off-label for this purpose. Bupropion is an antidepressant that has been shown to improve desire in some women with and without depression. Systemic estrogen therapy is not recommended in the absence of vasomotor symptoms and is not directly associated with desire. However, vaginal estrogen is useful in patients presenting with concomitant vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that can be used as an alternative to vaginal estrogen. Exogenous testosterone has demonstrated efficacy in treating loss of desire in postmenopausal women. However, patients should be counseled that it is not FDA-approved for this purpose and there are limited published long-term safety data. Several agents for the treatment of low desire are currently in development. Gynecologists are in a unique position to address concerns about sexual desire in women. Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction among women.",

Women living with psychiatric illness, despite their frequent sexual difficulties, consider sexuality to be an important aspect of their quality of life. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, the neurobiology and symptoms of the illness, past trauma, difficulties in establishing relationships and stigmatization can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Low sexual desire is strongly linked to depression. Lack of subjective arousal and pleasure are linked to trait anxiety: the sensations of physical sexual arousal may lead to fear rather than to pleasure. The most common type of sexual pain is 10 times more common in women with previous diagnoses of anxiety disorder. Clinicians often do not routinely inquire about their patients' sexual concerns, particularly in the context of psychotic illness but careful assessment, diagnosis and explanation of their situation is necessary and in keeping with patients' wishes. Evidence-based pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available but poorly researched in the context of psychotic illness.",

      "abstract": "A bstract : Between 4 and 13% of people with schizophrenia commit suicide and between 25 and 50% make a suicide attempt, a reflection of the devastating toll this syndrome takes on the quality of life, that is, the subjective and objective sense of well‐being. Many risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia have been identified, the most important of which are previous suicide attempts, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, and male gender. Insight into having a serious mental illness and less severe cognitive impairment are also associated with increased risk for suicide in schizophrenia, most likely when accompanied by feelings of hopelessness. Typical neuroleptic drugs have not been shown to reduce the risk of suicide. However, several types of evidence suggest that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, appreciably reduces the suicide attempt and completion rates in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, perhaps by as much as 75‐85%. Other atypical antipsychotic drugs may have a similar effect, but direct evidence is lacking. Improvement in positive and negative symptoms, reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), a direct antidepressant action, improved cognitive function, and improved compliance may contribute to reduced suicidality. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large prospective, randomized study intended to compare the effectiveness of clozapine with that of olanzapine in reducing suicide and suicide‐related events in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. Some information about suicidality in the patient sample is reported here.",

En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

      "abstract": "Since the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) mainly occurs in younger persons between the age of 20 and 40, sexual dysfunctions have great impact on their quality of life. About 50% of all female and about 75% of all male patients complain of sexual dysfunctions. The primary symptoms among males are erective and ejaculative dysfunctions and reduced libido, while female patients mainly complain of reduced libido, problems achieving orgasm, decreased vaginal lubrication and changes in vaginal sensitivity. Secondary organic symptoms include fatigue, spasticity, muscular weakness, bladder problems, pain, cognitive and behavioural changes. Tertiary dysfunctions refer to general psychosocial problems in relation to chronic, progressive disease. One third of all couples in which either the man or the woman suffers from MS complain of problems in sexual and marital life, where especially the healthy female partner in general has sexual problems. Diagnosing and treating sexual dysfunctions in MS should ideally be carried out by a specialized \"MS-team\" with the core professionals being the neurologist, urologist, (neuro) psychologist and the nurse. Information about symptoms and their possible causes is an important part of the treatment, and not least learning more efficient coping strategies. Both for the patient and for the couple honest and open informative communication including information about sexual aids and perhaps also medical treatment will often result in minimizing the sexual problems and increasing quality of life.",

      "title": "Is Multiple Sclerosis Patient Depressed, Stressed, or Both? How to Sort through Overlapping Symptoms and Provide Appropriate Treatment",
      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

      "title": "Perimenopausal Mental Disorders: Epidemiology and Phenomenology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Perimenopause, the interval of irregular menstrual activity which directly precedes menopause, is characterized by widely fluctuating hormone levels amidst a large-scale decline in circulating estrogen. This phase in a woman's life is typically accompanied by physical discomforts including vasomotor symptoms, such as headaches, insomnia, and hot flushes, as well as genital atrophy. Not surprisingly, studies suggest a significant increase in mood lability for women during this time. While some evidence points toward an exacerbation of bipolar mood symptoms and an increase in schizophrenic psychosis during perimenopause, the majority of research conducted on perimenopausal mental disorders has focused on unipolar depression. Studies vary widely in methodology, definitions of menopausal status, and degrees of depression among subjects; however, the majority of findings indicate an increased susceptibility to depression during the perimenopausal transition. This greater susceptibility may be due to neuroendocrine effects of declining estrogen levels, the subjective experience of somatic symptoms resulting from this hormonal decline, and/or the more frequent occurrence of “exit” or “loss” events for women during this stage of life. At this time, more research is needed to address questions of prevalence, risk, and etiology for depression and other major mental disorders as related to the physiological and psychosocial changes associated with perimenopause.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "title": "The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate",
      "abstract": "Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R ( American Psychiatric Association 1987 ), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 1994 ). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman’s quality of life.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC UPDATE OF THE CRIME \"PROFILE\" AND \"SIGNATURE\" IN SINGLE OR SERIAL HOMICIDES: RULE OUT LIMBIC PSYCHOTIC TRIGGER REACTION",
      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "A young woman with intense longings for love was unable to satisfy these desires by a normal sexual relationship with a man because of her fears and inhibitions. She developed urticaria at times when her longings were especially stimulated and frustrated. Twelve attacks were observed during analysis and their emotional settings are described. Eight of them occurred in connection with dreams. These dreams invariably ended on the verge of frustration in an \"almost but not quite\" situation. Other types of dreams out of a total of 94 were never followed by urticaria and vice versa, with the exception of a repetitive dream of reaching for an object or person who slipped from the patient's grasp. This dream was followed by weeping, when not by urticaria. The urticaria appeared when weeping was repressed and often terminated when the patient wept. Some of the observations are somewhat suggestive concerning the choice of sites for the urticaria. The findings were confirmed by a second analyzed case and by a few observations on five cases seen in interview. In connection with other observations, particularly on asthma, they led to the supposition of a possible relationship between certain states of allergic sensitivity and states of intense frustrated longing.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "abstract": "Urodynamic analysis has revealed a high proportion of uninhibited bladder activity in adult enuresis. There was no associated neurological deficit to explain this abnormality. There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

Case Presentation: A 25-year-old woman presented with complaints that the skin over the vagina is retracting inside her body and feeling that something will happen to her if it gets fully retracted for 9 months. She had multiple consultations with the gynecologist who found no anatomical abnormality on examination and referred the patient to a psychiatrist, where she was diagnosed with Koro syndrome and was started on psychotropic medication. Conclusion: Female with Koro syndrome is expressed mainly in an epidemic setting due to cultural and psycho-social factors such as cultural taboos that suppress the expression of atypical sexual symptoms, inadequate knowledge, and misconceptions.",

Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.‘ s p t t h t D h a r T t s c Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a combination of emotional, behavioral and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abate shortly after the onset of menses, and cause impairment in social and role functioning [1]. The hallmark emotional symptoms of PMDD include irritability, anxiety or tension, mood swings and depressed mood. PMDD occurs in approximately 5% of menstruating women and is considered the severe end of the spectrum of clinically significant premenstrual symptoms. Reduced quality of life (QoL), increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity at work have been documented in women with PMDD [2,3]. Recent reviews and expert guidelines summarize the diagnostic criteria, recommended forms for the prospective daily charting of symptoms and the importance of identifying a premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying mood or medical illness prior to the initiation of treatment [4–7]. The etiology of PMDD is likely to be multifactorial, and many possible etiological factors have been reviewed [8]. It is assumed that ovulation-related mechanisms trigger premenstrual symptoms in women with a vulnerability to CNS dysregulation [9]. Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with PMDD [8]. Studies also suggest an abnormal response to allopregnanolone and other γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic agonists during the luteal phase of the cycle [10]. The",

This syndrome is described as jerky ataxia and an unusual happy facial expression with pathological laughter. Severe mental retardation is a unique feature of the syndrome, together with microbrachycephaly and abnormal electroencephalographic findings with or without clinical seizures. The patients cannot speak or at most, they have a vocabulary consisting only of a few words. The genetic abnormality of AS has been located on chromosome 15q11-q13. Patients with AS mostly have deletions on the maternally derived allele (75–80%) while some of them show paternal uniparental disomy (~2%) or a rare imprinting mutation developmental disorder caused by deletion of the maternally-inherited chromosome 15q11–13. A 2.5-year-old girl is presented. Clinical suspicion of AS was raised at the age of 27 months when she presented with mental retardation and epilepsy, absence of speech, inability to gait and paroxysmal episodes of laughter. Moreover, she had facial dysmorphic features such as microbrachycephaly, mid-facial hypoplasia, macrostomia and a prominent mandible. Chromosomal analysis revealed 46 xx with the deletion of 15q chromosome (15q11q13-snrpn/ic) Our patient met the classical phenotype and genotype of AS.",

      "title": "Neurobiological outcomes in the offspring of postnatally depressed mothers: Causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "Postnatal depression (PND) is the most common psychological disorder to affect women in the postpartum period, with an estimated prevalence of 13% in high-income countries (Gavin et al. 2005; O’Hara and Swain 1996). In low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that rates of PND may be substantially higher, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 57% (Wachs et al. 2009). In terms of clinical presentation, depression occurring in the postnatal period appears to be indistinguishable from depression occurring at other times (Cooper et al., 2007), with persistent low mood and/or a profound loss of interest and enjoyment being defining characteristics. Other symptoms are mood-related disturbances in sleep, altered appetite, concentration impairment, retardation, agitation, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or impulses. The duration of episodes varies, but the majority of postpartum depressive episodes resolve spontaneously within 6 months to a year (Cooper and Murray 1995; Cox et al. 1993). Although PND may not be unique in terms of the symptom profile, the fact that this disorder occurs in the postpartum period is a particular concern. Specifically, PND affects the mother–infant dyad at a time when the infant is particularly reliant on his or her caregiver to meet their physical, social, and cognitive needs. The postpartum period is also a time when the family unit as a whole is likely to experience additional stress, and is therefore particularly vulnerable. Given these considerations, and the relatively high prevalence of PND, the potential for adverse impact is significant. One area of research focus, reviewed here, has examined the possibility the disturbances in the mother–child relationship occurring in the context of maternal PND result in fundamental alterations in key psychobiological systems in the infant, with persistent consequences. Notably, as PND typically resolves within the first year postpartum, and therefore is particularly relevant to early development, observations deriving from the study of PND in this area offer potentially broad insights into the relevance of early environmental factors to child neurobiological functioning. Given that depressive disorder is characterized by profound impairments in mood, energy levels, motivation, and feelings of self-worth, and has established detrimental effects on interpersonal functioning, it is perhaps unsurprising that mothers with PND have been found to show disturbances in the quality of care that they provide for their infant (for a review, see Murray et al. 2010a).",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas.

Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

Individuals with PGAD often experience a high degree of associated psychosocial impairment. The healthcare experiences of individuals with PGAD appear to share many similarities with what has been reported for other forms of genital discomfort (such as vulvodynia).

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have also been associated with sexual side effects. The procedure by which, the basic physiologic mechanisms of the normal sexual phases (libido, arousal, and orgasm) are disrupted by some psychotropics provide a framework to minimize sexual side effects when initiating and continuing treatment. Successful management of sexual complaints during treatment should begin with a systematic approach to determine the type of sexual dysfunction, potential contributing factors, and finally delineating strategies that should be tailored to the individual patient.

In fact, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with significant ejaculatory dysfunction and orgasm-related difficulties. However, the incidence of sexual dysfunction varies with SSRIs. The package inserts report a range from 2% (fluoxetine) up to 20% (sertraline, paroxetine), and in the clinical setting, sexual dysfunction has been reported to occur in 7.8% to 75% of depressed patients.",

      "abstract": "To gain new insights into the clinical presentation, causes, treatment and prognosis of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), and to develop hypotheses to be tested in a prospective investigation.In this retrospective multicenter study, all cases were included that fulfilled these criteria: constantly repeated fragments of epileptic seizures, with preserved consciousness, lasting ≥ 1 h and representing locally restricted motor or sensory epileptic activity. Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "The restrictions imposed upon sexual activity by neck, back and radicular pain syndromes are of serious concern to the patient. In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

In women, the cycle of sexual response begins in the brain, where a memory, an image, a scent, music, or a fantasy acts as a trigger to prompt sexual arousal. Thus, the brain is really the key and starting place for treatment of sexual dysfunction. Decreased libido, altered arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, and dyspareunia are the four broad types of sexual dysfunction in women. Decreased libido, thought to be related to androgenic hormones, results in delayed or altered arousal, decreased vaginal lubrication and dilation, delayed or absent orgasm, and pain or dyspareunia, which can lead to an aversion to sexual experiences.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

This article refers to studies that specifically have investigated sexual adverse effects caused by AD-treatment and strategies to handle and prevent these problems. A questionnaire sent to general practitioners showed that they are well aware of the problem with sexual adverse effect in AD treatment and ascribe it great importance. The knowledge of effects and side effects of newer AD drugs seemed somewhat insufficient. An increased knowledge about these substances and alternative treatment strategies would perhaps make it easier for the physicians to handle or avoid AD induced sexual side effects.",

      "title": "The Impact Of Menopause On The Musculoskeletal System: A Practical Overview",
      "abstract": "Key Points • Menopause is associated with a rapid decline in estrogen, which significantly affects bone, joint, and muscle health. • Bone loss accelerates during the menopause transition, with up to a 10% reduction in spine bone density within the first five years after the final menstrual period. • Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been shown to be effective in preserving bone density and reducing fracture risk. • Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, stiffness, and joint discomfort are common and often underrecognized during the menopause transition, sometimes leading to misdiagnosis. • Foundational strategies for preserving musculoskeletal health during and after menopause include lifestyle interventions such as strength training, balance exercises, and adequate protein and vitamin D intake. Menopause represents an important phase in a woman's reproductive life, marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, signalling the end of the reproductive years. In North America, the average age of onset is 50.5 years, generally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. Hormonal fluctuations and symptoms of hypoestrogenism—such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood and cognitive changes—can begin up to 10 years before menopause, during the perimenopausal or menopause transition. These symptoms stem from fluctuations in sex hormones, primarily estrogen, which has receptors distributed throughout the body and impacts nearly every organ system, including the bones, joints, and muscles. In this review, we will summarize the effects of hypoestrogenism on bone, joint, and muscle health during and beyond the menopause transition.",

Depression features included low mood with decreased interest in social activities, being less energetic, psychomotor slowing, and being more withdrawn and lonely. Sleep and appetite were good. She met only 3 of the 9 features of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Her Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)5 score was 11/30. Her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia6 score for depression in dementia was 13. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)7 score was 22/30, and she met the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's dementia. Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed generalized atrophy.\r\n\r\nMs A was started on galantamine 8 mg orally twice a day, which was subsequently increased to 16 mg orally twice a day after 4 weeks. Her minor depression features responded very well with galantamine monotherapy after 2 months. At that time, her MMSE score was 23/30, her GDS score was 4/30, and her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was 6.\r\n\r\nDepression is associated with defects of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, catecholamine, and acetylcholine. Depression in Alzheimer's dementia is linked to catecholaminergic deficit or degeneration of serotonergic neurons, and this process is also known to occur early in Alzheimer's dementia.8\r\n\r\nGalantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used in the treatment of dementia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist not only on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites but also on those located on axon terminals and are involved in the modulation of multiple neurotransmitter releases. Neuronal nAChR is a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are widely distributed in the brain and are controlled by acetylcholine and nicotine receptor agonists. In the genetically depressive rats, nicotine showed antidepressant-like effects through the involvement of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype. The α4 subunit in combination with the β2 subunit mediates dopaminergic and nonadrenergic release.9 Modulation of nAChR facilitates the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.10 Striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with high affinity for nicotinic agonists are involved with the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.11 Dopamine deficiency is associated with anhedonia, lack of interest, and psychomotor slowing (bradyphrenia), and it may arise as a consequence of cholinergic defects involving nAChR. Studies suggest galantamine in addition to mediating cholinergic neurotransmission also through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence several other neurotransmitter systems, possibly modulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA in certain nerve tracts.12,13 So, it is possible that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia, may also have some antidepressant effect.\r\n\r\nIf large studies prove this effect, we may not need to use an antidepressant in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients who have depression with dementia. This means less medication usage and potentially less adverse effect to these patients.",

      "abstract": "Without antidepressant therapy, episodes of clinical depression last from 2 months to several years, with an average of around 5 to 6 months. One-third of the patients recover within a year; probably one out of four untreated episodes may last more than 2 years. Depressive episodes occur, on the average, every 2 to 3 years. ECT and antidepressant drug therapy greatly reduce the duration of episodes and significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of affective disorders. With modern treatment, during a 5-year follow-up, about one quarter of depressed patients had no recurrent episodes, more than half recovered in less than 2 or 3 months, and about one in seven patients developed chronic depression (episodes lasting longer than 2 years). Suicide attempts were made by one fifth of this group of patients, and 6% committed suicide. However, three-fourths of the patients were well three-fourths of the time. Age and culture seem to influence the course of depression. In addition to the classified clinical depressions, there is a considerable prevalence in the general population of depressive symptomatology and dysphoric states, apparently related to genetic factors, age, and stress. Little is known about the course and indications for treatment of these latter conditions, which should be the target for more systematic study and research in the ever widening fields of the phenomenology and therapy of depression.",

PTSD may develop after a serious traumatic experience that induces feelings of intense fear, helplessness or horror. It is currently characterized by three key classes of symptoms which must cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning: (1) persistent and distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (3) persistent symptoms of hyper-arousal. One of the possible symptoms within the second class is difficulty in remembering an important aspect of the traumatic event. PTSD is not an uncommon condition, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of about 7-9% based on studies conducted in the United States and Canada, with women at higher risk than men. While not everyone who experiences a significant trauma will go on to develop PTSD, about a third will do so. Sexual assault, along with other forms of assaultive violence, pose a comparatively high risk of PTSD.",

They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

      "title": "RISADA PEGA: A Mnemonic Method in Portuguese for Alarm Criteria in Emergency Headaches",
      "abstract": "Introduction We present the first mnemonic method in Portuguese, “RISADA PEGA”, for alarm criteria in emergency headaches in order to facilitate their identification and diagnosis. A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

It was determined that the formation of the addictive behavior covers two stages – experiencing of an acute change in the mental state at the emotional level and the formation of a certain sequence of appeals to the means of addiction, which is common for different forms of such behavior. It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common.

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

It has not proved to reflect pathophysiologic changes at the level of the central nervous system or pituitary, and tissue availability of dexamethasone itself may contribute to test outcome. The sensitivity of the DST in major depression is limited (about 44% in over 5,000 cases) but is higher in psychotic affective disorders and mixed manic-depressive states (67% to 78%). The high specificity of the DST vs control subjects (over 90%) is not maintained vs other psychiatric disorders (77% specificity overall), and acute \"distress\" may contribute to nonsuppression of cortisol. The test may have power in differentiating severe melancholic depression, mania, or acute psychosis from chronic psychosis (87% specificity) or dysthymia (77% specificity). The DST status adds about 11% to the prediction of short-term antidepressant response. Suggestions that failure to maintain normal suppression of cortisol predicts poor outcome are not secure. Uncritical enthusiasm or excessive skepticism regarding the DST are unwarranted.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nHuman sexual function is complex and affected by many different factors. In patients with mental and emotional disorders such as schizophrenia, biological and psychosocial factors associated with sexual functioning are further complicated by illness and medication effects. Antipsychotic medication, the main modality of treatment in schizophrenia, is known to produce sexual side effects in addition to others such as weight gain and the metabolic syndrome. Because of the sensitive nature of the problem, many patients may not report this side effect to the therapist, though distressing to them, unless specifically asked for it. These sexual side-effects may subsequently lead to nonadherence, distress in patient and /or partner and marital dysharmony. Therefore effective management of this problem is essential. While prevention is most desirable, early identification and effective management of these sexual side effects could improve compliance and quality of life.\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo study the nature, prevalence and risk factors for sexual dysfunction in neuroleptic-naive women with psychosis, and to evaluate the incidence of antipsychotic induced sexual dysfunction in these individuals.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nConsecutive antipsychotic drug naive women with schizophrenia or acute psychosis who met eligibility criteria were rated on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for symptom severity and the Female Sexual Function Index for sexual functioning. Weight, blood sugar and prolactin levels were measured. Socio-demographic details were recorded. After six weeks and six months of treatment with antipsychotic medication, the assessments were repeated. Using SPSS for Windows (version 16.0.1), mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical data. Pearson’s correlation and chi square were calculated to assess relationships between continuous and categorical variables respectively.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nAmong the 104 subjects recruited, prevalence rates of sexual dysfunction were 67.3, 82.8 and 72.22% at baseline, six weeks and six months respectively. Incidence of sexual dysfunction at six weeks was 60%. The most common type of dysfunction was hypoactive sexual desire and orgasmic disorder. Factors associated with sexual dysfunction at different points of time included age, education, age of onset and duration of illness, negative and general psychopathology scores and type of antipsychotic used. Weight, prolactin level and dose of antipsychotic medication were not significantly associated with sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction is a quite frequent issue in clinical practice, mainly in chronic treatments affecting both quality of life and compliance. Recent findings In the last decade fortunately antidepressants and antipsychotic compounds have been deeply screened in order to identify sexual adverse events that were commonly underdiagnosed and previously underestimated by clinicians and perhaps by pharmaceutical companies as well. Some differences in the mechanism of action are the nucleus of this poorly tolerated adverse event. All antidepressants with serotonergic activity can cause mild to severe sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido and delayed orgasm frequently (>60%) or anorgasmia and arousal difficulties sometimes (30%). In contrast, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or melatonergic antidepressants do not cause sexual dysfunction but perhaps the clinical profile of patients receiving these compounds could be different. Antipsychotics that highly increase prolactin levels and strongly block dopamine receptors could be related to sexual dysfunction as well. Unfortunately, these dysfunctions are present during the long term after the antipsychotic onset to provide continued symptom control and enable recovery. Young patients suffering psychosis and concomitant sexual dysfunction (erectile and/or orgasmic difficulties) tend to show poor compliance in chronic treatments affecting the outcomes. Summary The implications of psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction in clinical practice are relevant mainly in patients under long-term treatment with previous satisfactory sexual life. Implications for future research about sexual dysfunction in all new treatments should be strongly taken into account.",

      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

Patients have been reported only in whom a definite psychiatric diagnosis was possible, as follows in order of frequency: reactive depression, anxiety state, hysteria, prepsychotic personality, and psychopathic personality. Previous personality characteristics were frequently as follows: excessive conscientiousness, excessive shyness, tendency to drift on the line of least resistance, hypochondriasis, and excessive dependency. Usually the sexual activity was that of continence with an occasional lapse always followed by guilt feelings. The discharge often developed after a period of continence with temptation, excepting in a proportion of cases in which it represented the persistence of an originally infective discharge. Its onset or persistence could usually be correlated with the psychiatric history. Twenty-eight patients were given psychiatric treatment, mostly psychotherapy at a fairly superficial level. Short term follow-up indicated improvement in the local condition as well as the psychiatric disorder, although failures occurred and risks were involved.

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "title": "Neurological Signs and the Heterogeneity of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

Children with conduct disorders, with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have an elevated risk for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorders in adolescence and adulthood. The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high. In fact, these rates are higher for women than for men. In the fourth decade of life, most of the antisocial and psychopathic personalities are in remission.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "abstract": "El sindrome premenstrual (SPM) se caracteriza por una serie de sintomas emocionales y somaticos que se presentan durante la segunda mitad del ciclo menstrual y alcanzan su maximo nivel en el periodo anterior a la menstruacion. Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

Esta cifra es mucho más elevada que la que se encuentra en enfermos depresivos más jóvenes y puede atribuirse al efecto patoplástico de la edad. El sexo del enfermo no guarda ninguna relación estadística con la frecuencia con que aparecen estos síntomas. &#x0D; &#x0D; Los síntomas hipocondríacos se manifestaron, solos, o acompañados de otros síntomas depresivos, desde el comienzo de la enfermedad en 72-casos (47,3%).

      "title": "The behavioural toxicity of antidepressants",
      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "Some biological factors which have been shown to be abnormal in subgroups of women with dysphoric premenstrual syndromes (PMS) have not been limited to the symptomatic late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, but also existed during the non‐symptomatic mid‐follicular phase of the cycle. Personality, cognitive functions, α 2 and imidazoline binding, sensitivity to inducement of panic attacks, relative hypothyroidism, and some but not all serotonergic functions of women with dysphoric PMS differ from those with no PMS, and also differ during a non‐symptomatic phase of the cycle. It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait. It is postulated that some vulnerability traits to specific premenstrual syndromes might also be vulnerability traits to depression or anxiety in general.",

Although depression itself, apart from medication, is generally believed to be associated with sexual dysfunction, the few existing studies report wide discrepancies with regard to frequency, gender, and quality of sexual dysfunction. Loss of libido is frequently and consistently associated with major depression. Moreover, sexual dysfunction secondary to depression or other factors is often mistaken for that caused by antidepressant medication. Although antidepressants have long been associated with sexual dysfunction, the precise nature and magnitude of sexual side effects have not been fully appreciated. This article will review the literature on sexual dysfunction associated with unmedicated depression and offer a guide for the clinician evaluating and treating depressed patients with sexual problems.",

Changes in libido apart from dyspareunia are often of psychological origin and are probably caused as much by ageing as by a fall in oestrogen production.

Patients with addictive disorders frequently experience sexual dysfunctions and chronic use of substances tends to adversely affect all stages of sexual response, in both male and female abusers. An important aspect in the management of sexual dysfunction is psychosocial intervention. In addictive disorders, sexual dysfunction is of high clinical relevance, as it often leads to treatment non adherence and sexual or marital disharmony. Instead of a disease-centred approach, a couple and relationship centred approach of management is desirable. A detailed history about the sexual dysfunction, the addictive disorder and enquiry into various psychosocial aspects is mandatory for adequate management of the same. Sexual therapy, behavioural techniques, systematic sensitization and desensitization are some of the techniques used in the management of sexual dysfunction in addictive disorders. The assessment and treatment need to be tailored depending upon the various psychosocial aspects of the individual.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An evaluator's failure to recognize illness behavior and to adjust for its effect on symptom presentation can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding impairment or disability; here the authors review the associated phenomena of somatization, disorders that arise from it, and factors that contribute to somatization. Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

      "title": "Understanding the Importance of the Evaluation and Treatment of Elevated Androgens in Autism Spectrum Disorder",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent, life-long, neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in more than 1% of children in the United States (the most recent estimate exceeds one in 68 children) with strong gender basis towards males (one in 42 boys) relative to females (one in 189 girls) [1]. In addition to the diagnostic impairments specified in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for ASD in socialization, restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, and communi‐ cation, which must be present in the early developmental period, many individuals diagnosed with an ASD frequently have co-morbid aggression and severe irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behaviors, which can become a major source of additional distress and can interfere with functioning [2]. Similarly, others have observed the occurrence of co-morbid conditions among individuals diagnosed with an ASD as follows: hyperactivity (67%), sensory processing problems (85%), anxiety/fear (74%), behavioral problems (89%), and obsessive-compulsive behaviors (92%) [3]. These investigators described that behavioral problems and obsessivecompulsive behaviors were reported to be the most serious and problematic. In addition, investigators described that some individuals diagnosed with an ASD show significant deterioration in symptoms about the time of puberty [4]. Among the symptoms that worsened according to these investigators were disruptive behavior, destructiveness, restlessness, and partial loss of acquired social and academic skills.",

Issues reviewed include the aetiology of these dysfunctions (most probably due to a variety of causes), epilepsy as such, as well as drugs used for its treatment; these issues are closely related to each other and have a considerable effect on the manifestations of this condition. Impairments of sex steroid concentrations, hypothalamic pituitary function, as well as testicular function, form a basis for reproductive dysfunction in male patients with epilepsy. The psychosocial complications of epilepsy can have implications for reproductive health and sexual function. Practitioners should pay more attention to these problems, as patients frequently deny or fail to notice some of these disturbances.",

Despite their value in identifying and evaluating sexual dysfunction, screening tools and questionnaires should never substitute for a thorough sexual, medical, and psychosocial history. For patients with multiple sexual dysfunction symptoms following cancer diagnosis or treatment (e.g., ED and low libido), further evaluation of these symptoms is always recommended prior to initiating therapy for cancer or sexual dysfunction. Whenever possible, the temporal association or causal relationship between the symptoms should be assessed. The sexual, medical and psychosocial history is an essential element in the basic evaluation and should be obtained in all patients presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction. The essential components of sexual function assessment in the male should always include: erectile response (onset, duration, progression, severity of the problem, nocturnal/morning erections, self-stimulatory and visual erotic-induced erections), altered sexual desire, ejaculation, orgasm, sexually-related genital pain disorders, and partner sexual function, if available.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "We predicted that the largely female population seeking relief from the incapacitating symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an enigmatic illness, would feel stigmatized, and that attribution of CFS symptoms to psychological causes by physicians would contribute significantly to the CFS-related stigma. Most subjects scored high on measures of stigma: 95% had feelings of estrangement, 70% believed that others attributed their CFS symptoms to psychological causes, 77% coped by using an educational strategy (disclosure) and 39% saw a need to be secretive about their symptoms in some circumstances. Most subjects (77%) were labeled as 'psychological cases' by one or more of the physicians (mean = 8) consulted, but of the 4 stigma measures, only disclosure was related to physician labeling. Such factors as duration ofw illness and unemployment, dissatisfaction with spouse, and symptom severity correlated significantly with measures of stigma.That many physicians were reportedly ignorant or skeptical of CFS (male more so than female MD's) may influence attempts of CFS patients to legitimize their symptoms by disclosure and lead to high rates of health care system use.",

Retardation can occur with or without any other mental or physical disorder. However, mentally retarded individuals can experience the full range of mental disorders, and the prevalence of other mental disorders is at least three to four times greater in this population than in the general population. In addition, mentally retarded individuals are at greater risk of exploitation and physical/sexual abuse. Adaptive behaviour is always impaired, but in protected social environments where support is available this impairment may not be at all obvious in subjects with mild mental retardation.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Frequent diseases most commonly encountered in elderly patients--i.e. diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, depression, etc--represent a frequent cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) and are treated with medications that can interfere with sexual functioning at the central and/or peripheral level. Antidepressants, including the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, have been implicated in ED, decreased libido, and impaired ejaculation. Most antihypertensives have been associated with some erectile impairment, but diuretics seem to have little effect on erectile function. The calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are associated with a low incidence of ED. Sympatholytic antihypertensives seldom cause importence but can cause retrograde ejaculation because of the relaxation of the smooth muscles in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. The most commonly prescription drugs that can affect sexual function are briefly discussed and an integrated pharmacological approach to the patient with drug-induced ED is proposed.",

Patients do not always present with obsessions or compulsions and this may complicate the process of diagnosing and starting adequate treatment. In this article three patients suffering from OCD but not presenting with obsessions or compulsions are discussed. In the first case, in a 42-year-old woman, the presenting symptom is a therapy-resistant dermatitis, due to excessive washing. The second patient, a 27-year-old man, presented with a depression, a frequent comorbid condition. In the third case, a 34-year-old man, the effects on and the suffering of the partner and family of a patient with OCD (they were asked to co-operate in his compulsive behaviour) were the reason for his wife to consult the general practitioner. OCD has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.5% and is somewhat more frequent in females than in males. The most characteristic symptoms are obsessions and/or compulsions. They cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), and interfere significantly with the person's functioning (occupational, social activities, relationships). Neurobiological studies suggest genetic influences and dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the brain. The treatment of OCD consists of pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy, but it is a lifelong condition.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",

Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients.

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Un total de seis o mas manifestaciones de (1), (2) y (3), con l menos dos de (1), al menos una de (2), y al menos una de (3). 1. Trastorno cualitativo de la relacion, expresado como minimo en dos de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Trastorno importante en muchas conductas de relacion no verbal, como la mirada a los ojos, la expresion facial, las posturas corporales y los gestos para regular la interaccion social. b. Incapacidad para desarrollar relaciones con iguales adecuadas al nivel de desarrollo. c. Ausencia de conductas espontaneas encaminadas a compartir placeres, intereses o logros con otras personas (por ejemplo, de conductas de senalar o mostrar objetos de interes). d. Falta de reciprocidad social o emocional.  2. Trastornos cualitativos de la comunicacion, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Retraso o ausencia completa de desarrollo del lenguaje oral (que no se intenta compensar con medios alternativos de comunicacion, como los gestos o mimica). b. En personas con habla adecuada, trastorno importante en la capacidad de iniciar o mantener conversaciones. c. Empleo estereotipado o repetitivo del lenguaje, o uso de un lenguaje idiosincrasico. d. Falta de juego de ficcion espontaneo y variado, o de juego de imitacion social adecuado al nivel de desarrollo. 3. Patrones de conducta, interes o actividad restrictivos, repetitivos y estereotipados, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Preocupacion excesiva por un foco de interes (o varios) restringido y estereotipado, anormal por  su intensidad o contenido. b. Adhesion aparentemente inflexible a rutinas o rituales especificos y no funcionales. c. Estereotipias motoras repetitivas (por ejemplo, sacudidas de manos, retorcer los dedos, movimientos complejos de todo el cuerpo, etc.). d. Preocupacion persistente por partes de objetos. B. Antes de los tres anos, deben producirse retrasos o alteraciones en una de estas tres areas: (1) Interaccion social, (2) Empleo comunicativo del lenguaje o (3) Juego simbolico.  C.

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Current prevalence ranges of factitious disorders is between 0.05 and 2.0%, with women being 4–20-fold more likely to be affected than men (1, 4–8). Contemporary psychodermatology classifies these disorders as: 1) dermatoses of primary psychiatric genesis (emotional/psychiatric disorders); 2) dermatoses with a multifactiorial basis, of which the course is subject to psychiatric influences (psychosomatic disease); or 3) secondary psychiatric disorders due to serious or disfiguring dermatoses (somatopsychic disease) (9).

Pain was most frequent in patients with neurosis and personality disorder. The occurrence of pain was significantly associated with unskilled work, but was not related to experience of social stress. Patients with pain reported more anxiety and hostile feelings and had a higher degree of somatic anxiety and muscular tension, thus attaching importance to anxiety‐induced muscle spasm as a pain‐mediating mechanism. A specific relationship between pain and depression was not supported.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

El presente trabajo valida una herramienta para el diagnostico y posterior tratamiento de estas autolesiones sin intencion suicida.

Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin. There are also gender differences between men and women in both the type of self - harm and in the level of it.",

The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies considerably between studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence. The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women.

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of depressive symptoms in the perimenopause is associated with a variety of factors. A previous history of either depression and or pre-menstrual syndrome as well as cognitive factors explain most of the variance. There are no consistent findings of a correlation between any serum hormone level and severity or presence of mood symptoms. Neurobiological studies show, with regard to an antidepressant effect, promising effects of estradiol on serotonergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic functions. Progestogens seem to oppose many of these effects. The role of adrenergic hormones and DHEA(S) is less clear. Most clinical trials showed a modest effect on symptoms of depression. However, the predominantly poor methodological quality does not allow generalisation and recommendations. A “tonic“ effect on well-being in non- or mild depressed women should not be regarded as true antidepressant effect. Results yielded in studies of surgically menopausal women may not be applicable to women with natural menopause. With regard to the domino theory, future studies should also focus on the mediation of treatment effects through alleviation of vasomotor symptoms or sleep quality. With regard to the dementias, the large Womens' Health Initiative revealed an increased risk of cognitive impairment in women 65 y and older treated with estrogen plus progestin. The estrogen only trial is still going on. Even before starting this trial, the available clinical and epidemiological database revealed no relevant effects (except for some verbal functions) in already demented patients and on normal neuropsychological symptoms of ageing. Whether estrogen treatment in earlier periods (e.g. perimenopause) or the endogenous hormone production reduce the risk of dementia in later life, is not clear yet. Overall, pathophysiological interactions of a variety of biological, psychological and social factors must be taken into account when studying the effects on mood and cognition.",

The prevalence in male carriers over 50 years is approximately 40%.1 In female carriers (approximately 1 in 260), the prevalence has not been as extensively studied, but may be as low as 8% over age 40.2 We present the case of a 65-year-old female with a 6-year history of bilateral hand tremor. The symptoms slowly progressed. Currently, she has tremor when holding a cup and has mild tremor when writing. She has no other issues with activities of daily living. She has no cognitive complaints, loss of dexterity or coordination, or other tremor localizations. In addition, she describes long-standing unsteadiness when walking. On physical examination, she has bilateral mild postural and moderate intention tremor of both arms. Mild tremor at rest in her left hand is also observed. Tone, power, and reflexes are normal. She has no limb ataxia, rigidity, or bradykinesia. During walking, she has mild reduced arm swing and her tandem gait is slightly unsteady. Her brain MRI shows mild atrophy, predominantly in the cerebellum, with no evidence of middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) sign or corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity. Her father had arm tremor for many years. Her son has Fragile X syndrome. The patient has an FMR1 premutation (97 repeats), and her symptoms are compatible with FXTAS. Since the original description of FXTAS, there have been many reports and series describing phenotypic differences between males and females. In males, FXTAS is usually characterized by progressive tremor and gait ataxia. Other common features are parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. Cognitive decline is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom. Brain MRI usually shows atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellar cortex, corpus callosum and pons, and white matter increased T2 signal intensity. The MCP sign (middle cerebellar peduncles hyperintense signal in T2) is observed in approximately 60% of the cases.1, 2, 4 In contrast, in females with FXTAS, tremor is rarely the initial presentation and is usually a later feature (prevalence of tremor range: 12%–75%) and ataxia is typically milder than in males. As in males, the neurophysiological characteristics of tremor in women with FXTAS have not been well studied. In addition, there are few detailed descriptions of the clinical features of tremor in FXTAS. Parkinsonism can be prominent as the disease progresses. Cognitive impairment is less commonly reported and leads to minor disability. Depression is a common feature (approximately 40%), and, interestingly, it was suggested that women with FXTAS show predisposition to psychogenic disorders. In female premutation carriers, primary ovarian dysfunction (20%), sensory loss (45%), chronic pain (26%), thyroid disorders (50%), and fibromyalgia are also common features. MRI studies showed MCP in only 13% of females.1-5 In our patient, the clinical presentation with a slowly progressive intention tremor and mild gait disturbance could potentially lead to the misdiagnosis of essential tremor. The early development of mild ataxia (rather than later onset that may be more common in essential tremor) was a clue to the diagnosis. In her case, the family history of Fragile X syndrome also clearly oriented the diagnosis; however, FXTAS should also be considered in the absence of a family history of mental retardation, autism, or learning disorders.

      "abstract": "Reasons: Schizophrenia is typically an adult neurodevelopmental disorder that has its antecedents in childhood and adolescence. Little is known about disorders “usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence” (e.g., childhood-onset disorders) in “prodromal” teens at heightened clinical risk for psychotic disorder. Main Findings: Childhood-onset disorders were prevalent in putatively prodromal teens, including anxiety and disruptive disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and, surprisingly, elimination disorders. These may reflect developmental antecedents in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Key Data and Statistics: A case series of 9 teens (ages 13–17) identified as prodromal to psychosis were evaluated with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). Childhood-onset diagnoses commonly endorsed (threshold or subthreshold) included ADHD (5/9), oppositional defiant disorder (5/9), enuresis or encopresis (4/9), conduct disorder (2/9), separation anxiety (3/9), and transient tic disorder (2/9). Enuresis was identified in 3 of the 4 older teens (ages 15–17). Major Conclusions: An understanding of the childhood-onset disorders that occur in teens at risk for psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, can shed light on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and potentially inform early identification and intervention.",

(2012) found that nearly 13% of their younger respondents (under 45) had perimenopausal symptoms which 'severely compromised quality of life', peaking amongst those who were four years post-menopause, with 31.6% reporting the same problem (p.549).Although the gradual decline with aging of hormones, like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, is the basis of natural menopause, some women have sudden onset menopause due to surgery, such as a full hysterectomy, which also removes the ovaries, or medication such as Tamoxifen for breast cancer.Equally -at least if we consult data from the Global Northsymptoms usually start to occur in a woman's mid-to-late 40s, and menopause is reached at 51.Even so, about 1% of women go through early menopause (before the age of 45), or premature menopause (before the age of 40).English language research into menopause in the Brazilian and wider Latin American context, however, suggests some compelling differences as well as some similarities between",

      "title": "Depression and the apathy symptom are associated with poorer cognitive functioning in very old men",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Older adults (65+) are among the fastest growing segments of the population, projected to double by 2050. Oldest‐old (85+) manifest the greatest relative increase in population and have the greatest risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Depression is a chronic, debilitating condition in older adults. Depressive symptoms, particularly apathy—and poor concentration—have been associated with poor cognitive functioning and dementia. However, some associations depend upon gender, age of depression onset, and preexisting cognitive impairment; other studies find no association. Associations have been primarily in relatively young samples, and apathy has infrequently been studied in the very old. We investigated the cross‐sectional associations of depressive symptoms and apathy with cognitive functioning in cognitively normal very old men. Methods Participants consisted of 74 cognitively intact male veterans (age = 86 ±5.1 [mean ± SD ], range = 76‐98; 81.1 % White, 18.9% Black; 15‐item Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] = 2.6 ±2.7, range = 0‐12; 13.5% depressed [GDS ≥ 6]) enrolled in the Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Successful Cognitive Aging in Very Old Male Veterans study. The predictors were the GDS‐15 and the apathy item “Have you dropped many of your activities and interests?” Cognitive outcomes, from factor analysis of 11 neuropsychological test scores, were three Varimax factor cognitive domains (Episodic Memory, Attention, Executive Function), and the first principal component (global cognition). Linear regression analyses adjusted for age and education. Results Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer global cognition (r = ‐.274, p = .020). Apathy was significantly associated with poorer Attention (r = ‐.403, p &lt; .001) and global cognition (r = ‐.377, p = .001). Apathy remained significant after controlling for the sum of other depressive symptoms. Conclusion These results extend others’ findings by showing that depressive symptoms, and specifically apathy, are associated with poorer cognitive functioning in very old men. This study highlights the relevance of examining depressive symptoms as predictors of cognitive functioning. The small effect sizes (r ≤ .097) for memory, the hallmark cognitive symptom of AD, suggest possible non‐AD biological involvement. Future studies with larger and more demographically and ethnically diverse samples are warranted.",

Impairments of sex steroid concentrations, hypothalamic – pituitary function, as well as testicular function, form a basis for reproductive dysfunction in male patients with epilepsy. The psychosocial complications of epilepsy can have implications for reproductive health and sexual function. Practitioners should pay more attention to these problems, as patients frequently deny or fail to notice some of these disturbances.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "It is recognized that patients with anorexia nervosa commonly have other psychiatric illnesses. No study, to our knowledge, has determined whether these other psychiatric disorders occur prior to the age of onset of anorexia nervosa. We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioural symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in a close reciprocal relation with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other non-antidepressant treatments, or the more extreme intervneitons that eliminate ovulation altogether, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that SSRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SSRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda .

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

With respect to the emotional factors involved in the side effects of OCs on the basis of a study of a sample of 70 young and healthy women it is concluded that some side effects of OCs appear to be psychosomatic and actually due to the fear and anticipation of side effects on the part of the patients. It was also found that women suffering from emotional maladjustment tended to complain of more and more serious side effects. Some side effects appear to be due to biological causes (e.g. weight gain enlargment of the breast) others to psychological causes (depression irritability decreased interest in sexual relations) while others (e.g. fatigue and nausea) may be caused by factors of either type.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is associated with several symptoms which, if they reach certain intensity, can severely impair the quality of life. Overall, 90.9% of Latin American women will have at least one climacteric symptom and in 25%, these will be severe. Musculoskeletal pain, physical and mental fatigue and depressed mood are the most common climacteric symptoms. Dyspareunia, mood disorders and irritability can significantly alter female sexuality. Hot flashes are the symptoms most frequently related to menopause by both physicians and patients. However, it is one of the less common menopausal symptoms. This symptom reflects the neurochemical brain disorders caused by estrogen deficiency. The central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in changes of body composition leading to higher adipose tissue accumulation during climacterium, deteriorating quality of life and increasing the risk for chronic non-transmittable diseases. Menopausal discomfort also overloads health systems increasing the demand for medical services and decreasing productivity by labor absenteeism. Hormone therapy of menopause (HTM) decreases menopausal symptoms and improves quality of life. If we do not prescribe HTM to those women who need it, we could deprive them from several potential health benefits.",

      "title": "Specific Stimulus-Evoked Violent Action in Psychotic Trigger Reaction: A Seizure-like Imbalance between Frontal Lobe and Limbic Systems?",
      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

      "title": "Étude du sentiment de familiarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance : une hyperfamiliarité aux visages",
      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

MDD is characterised by periods of depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure that lasts at least two weeks. These symptoms are accompanied by a number of somatic symptoms (changes in sleep, libido, energy and vigour, appetite and psychomotor function, etc) as well as cognitive symptoms (feelings of worthlessness, concentration or decision making difficulty, poor concentration and suicidal thoughts) that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of everyday functionality.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

      "title": "Influence of Sex Hormones in a Mouse Model of Multi Etiology Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Up to 80% of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients suffer from concurrent vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) resulting in multi‐etiology dementia. VCID (the 2nd leading cause of dementia) is more common in men throughout most of the lifespan. while the majority (approximately 2/3) of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients are women. Ageing is a main dementia risk factor which may act through the depletion of sex hormones. Both testosterone, in men, and estrogen, in women, have been shown to be neuroprotective. In this study we examine the effect of gonadal hormones on cognitive changes in a mouse model of multi etiology dementia using the App NL‐F/NL‐F knock‐in Alzheimer’s disease mouse model that does not overexpress amyloid precursor protein. Methods 5‐6 months old App NL‐F/NL‐F mice were subjected to gonadectomy or sham surgery and left to recover for 3 weeks to clear any endogenous gonadal hormones. Multi‐etiology dementia was modeled using chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (unilateral carotid artery occlusion). Control animals ( App NL‐F/NL‐F without hypoperfusion; AD only model) received a sham surgery. Mice were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests before being euthanized and then brains and serum were collected. Results Cognitive impairment differences between groups were investigated using several behavioral tests: anxiety‐like behavior and activity levels using an open field testing, episodic‐like memory using a novel object recognition test, spatial learning and memory via Barnes maze testing and activities of daily living using a nest building test. Our next step is to evaluate the underlying pathology in the brain that could mediate cognitive deficits (i.e. amyloid pathology, white matter damage and neuroinflammation). Conclusions We hope that this work will highlight the importance of modeling endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and will contribute to further understanding of sex differences and sex specific risk factors for dementia.",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence.

      "title": "Schizophrenia and Risk of Dementia: A Literature Review.",
      "abstract": "Introduction Dementia is a clinical syndrome affecting 1-2% of the population under the age of 65, while at older ages the frequency doubles every five years. The clinical manifestations include memory loss, communication deficits, agnosia, apraxia and executive dysfunction.Schizophrenia is a complex, chronic mental disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population, presenting with disturbances in perception, thought and behavior. Objectives To investigate the relationship between schizophrenia and later-onset dementia; more specifically to explore whether schizophrenia increases the dementia risk. Methods A review of 35 articles -from 2010 to 2023- on PubMed and Google Scholar regarding patients with schizophrenia or other type of psychosis, who later presented dementia. Results Patients with a history of schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, or delusional disorder are more likely to develop dementia.The greatest risk is presented in patients showing the shortest duration of psychotic symptoms (5 years or less), while at 5-10 years the probability of developing dementia decreases.The most common types of dementia occurring in psychotic patients are alzheimer’s disease (50-70%),vascular dementia (30%) and unspecified dementia (15%).Chronic patients (10+ years of symptomatology) are less likely to develop dementia. Psychotic patients over the age of 65 are more likely to develop dementia later in life, while individuals who develop schizophrenia after their 40s are three to four times more likely to present dementia compared to patients carrying a schizophrenia diagnosis before their 40s.Females with Late-Onset Schizophrenia have an increased dementia risk compared to males carrying the same diagnosis and compared to healthy females of the same age. Physical conditions implicated in the onset of dementia in schizophrenic patients include cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, substance and alcohol use, head injuries and diabetes. Conclusions According to data, there is a strong correlation between schizophrenia and dementia.However, the related studies are limited in number, while their results require further investigation because of limitations (small sample sizes, co-morbidities, selection of chronic elderly patients).Furthermore, most of these studies were conducted in Western countries, highlighting the necessity of pursuing additional research.

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "title": "SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE. Management Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and anti-seizure drugs used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other anti-seizure drugs (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use. Genetic counseling SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the sex of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Women complain of unbidden feelings of genital arousal that are qualitatively different from sexual arousal that is preceded by sexual desire/and or subjective arousal. The majority of women find PGAD distressing and report only brief relief with orgasm. In this article, we describe five women who believe they developed PGAD either after withdrawing from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants or while using them. We discuss these sexual symptoms in relation to what is already known about prolonged SSRI withdrawal syndromes and the possible etiologies of these conditions. While not a common cause of PGAD, it is possible that use of, and withdrawal from, pharmacological agents contributes to the development of PGAD.",

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered.

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

However, in 10-20% of patients, the pain persists for months or years despite relevant treatment trials. Both acute (duration <3 months) and chronic (duration> 3 months) conditions are investigated through a diagnostic triage: • First, it is clarified whether red flags are present that require prompt action. • Thereafter, we assess whether the pain is due to possible specific diagnoses. • If the patient is in the residual group, a broader assessment is made to identify any treatment options and prognosis. Essential clinical characteristics RED FLAGS Any initial assessment of the patient with back pain is initiated by clinically identifying the few serious diagnoses that require urgent or urgent action: Sphincter symptoms or abnormal sensitivity / reflex conditions of the perineum cause cauda equina syndrome. Progressive palsy of upper or lower extremities or paralysis is often indicative of threatening nerve root incarceration. L’Hermitte’s signs, bilateral UE symptoms, hyper-reflex or Babinski’s toe phenomenon. Think incipient medullary cross-sectional syndrome. Common symptoms with eg weight loss, fatigue and fever, previous cancer disease, +50 years. Think of other red flags like infection, system disease or cancer.",

However, the sexual problems affecting women with neurological disease are not well described. The etiology of female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions is multifactorial. There are both psychological and physiological etiologies that can be difficult to separate. The more common psychological problems arise from difficulty adapting to a chronic, and sometimes progressive, illness. Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy. Female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions affecting primarily the autonomic nervous system has not been well studied. It is important for physicians to recognize symptoms of sexual dysfunction since there are treatments available that can improve the patient's quality of life.",

When the individual refuses to accept medical opinion and attributes the pain to a physical illness and persistently seeks diagnosis and treatment, then there is a possibility of an unexplained somatic problem. Depression, anxiety or even a personality disorder may be causative factors. The lack of studies of this type of disorder in the prison environment makes it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of this phenomenon for primary health care consultation in prison, despite the fact that the number of presented unexplained somatic complaints may well be the same as in the community (around 15%).

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical studies show that often persons affected by depression and schizophrenia can suffer of impairment of the sexual function. Most antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs have adverse sexual effects but it is difficult to identify if the impairment of the sexual function can be attributed to clinical picture or to the psychopharmacological treatments. Both antidepressants and novel and conventional antipsychotics are associated with significant sexual side effects and the presence of sexual side effects may affect compliance and adherence to treatment. In some specific clinical populations (e.g. youths), these specific side-effects turn out to be one of the most annoying and promote increased drop-out rates and poor adherence to treatment. Nevertheless, these clinical variables are often underestimated or not investigated in the course of follow-up of persons suffering from psychiatric disorders in treatment with psychotropic medications. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs has led to attempts to use adjuvants or substitute treatments to resolve sexual dysfunction. Effects on sexual function should be carefully diagnosed and treated; it should clearly discuss with patients in order to preserve an adequate quality of life, promote greater adherence to treatment and promote a good remission and recovery. The aim of this study is to review the most recent and significant literature data regarding association between sexual dysfunction and psychotropic medications, especially highlighting neurobiological and clinical data in order to improve the clinical pratice.",

      "abstract": "Major depression is frequently associated with sexual dysfunction (over 70% of patients), and the antidepressant medications used to treat the illness may exacerbate pre-existing sexual dysfunction, or induce sexual dysfunction not present on diagnosis. In women, sex hormones that change across the life cycle, menstrual cycle, and diurnally have direct effects on sexual functioning, and indirect effects via modulation of neurotransmitter systems. These complex neuroendocrine effects lead to the sexual dysfunction seen with antidepressants. Strategies to manage these effects have had some success. They include switching to antidepressants with minimal sexual side effects, addition of hormones and/or antidotes, and lowering the dose of medication. Emerging data on the pathophysiology of sexual function and dysfunction, and new treatment options may lead to improved quality of life for women diagnosed with depression.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women: Physiology, Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Nearly half of women in the United States report problems with sexual function. Many health care providers do not ask about sexual concerns during routine clinical encounters because of personal discomfort, lack of familiarity with treatment, or the belief that they lack adequate time to address this complex issue. This may be especially true for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the most commonly identified sexual problem among women. HSDD is characterized by a deficiency of sexual thoughts, feelings, or receptiveness to sexual stimulation that has been present for at least 6 months, causes personal distress, and is not due to another medical condition. This is an up‐to‐date overview of HSDD for clinicians, discussing its physiology, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Although a definitive physiology of HSDD is still unknown, multiple hormones and neurotransmitters likely participate in a dual‐control model to balance excitation and inhibition of sexual desire. For assessment and diagnosis, validated screening tools are discussed, and the importance of a biopsychosocial assessment is emphasized, with guidance on how this can be implemented in clinical encounters. The 2 recently approved medications for HSDD, flibanserin and bremelanotide, are reviewed as well as off‐label treatments. Overall, HSDD represents a common yet likely underrecognized disorder that midwives and other health care providers who care for women across the life span are in a unique position to address.",

The symptoms appear or increase in the evening and during the night, they are provoked by rest, and are totally or partially relieved by moving the legs [1, 2] . Diagnosis of RLS is based solely on the presence of the abovementioned symptoms without any definite objective measurement. The etiology of RLS remains unclear, but the strongest evidence supports the ‘iron theory’: symptoms of RLS are a result of peripheral and central iron deficiency leading to disturbances in dopaminergic transmission [3] . RLS is a frequent disorder – primary RLS was found in 2.4% of the general population in a recent study [4] . In another study, RLS of any form (primary and secondary) and of any frequency of symptoms was found in 7.2% of the general population [5] . The above facts (subjectivity of the symptoms, unclear etiology and high frequency in the general population) should be remembered when analyzing the data on the prevalence of RLS in other diseases.

The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

These emotional disturbances can create physical conditions that lead to increased difficulty in achieving an erection. Depression can deprive a person of the ability to experience many of life's pleasures. It not only affects the mind but also the body--often in unexpected ways. As a result, many men who have been diagnosed with depression find themselves suffering from another condition: ED. Sexual dysfunction is a big problem also in patients with chronic renal failure and seriously affects their quality of life. About 40% of men on dialysis suffer from ED. Many uremic patients have additional symptoms including reduction of libido and a decreased frequency of sexual intercourse. With the start of dialysis some of these symptoms may improve, without, however, returning to normal.",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dysfunction in men may be related to multiple factors according to the type of sexual problems (e.g. low desire, erectile, or ejaculatory disturbances). Organic and psychological factors both contribute to the development of male sexual dysfunction. Among organic causes, endocrine disorders (the most important of which is hypogonadism) may contribute to the occurrence of male sexual dysfunction, but are much less frequent than other organic causes (i.e. vascular, neurological, and drug-induced). Clinical assessment (including a sexual history) is important for identifying patients with hormonal (e.g. testosterone deficiency) or other disorders (e.g. vascular or neurological) who may present with symptomatic sexual dysfunction. The aetiology(ies) underlying the sexual dysfunction will guide the most appropriate treatment in individual cases. Management of male sexual dysfunction may include psychological counselling, pharmacological therapy (e.g. PDE5Is), surgery, and testosterone replacement therapy in cases of well-documented hypogonadism. Despite the recent improvements due to the use of PDE5Is, in the management of erectile dysfunction remains largely unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients so there is still a major treatment gap and challenge ahead.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "PROGNOSIS IN MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES",
      "abstract": "A follow-up study of 208 manic-depressive conditions is reported. Analysis of such conditions permits the following summary. Positive heredity is common—chiefly depressions, and more commonly in the direct line of heredity. This shows more consistently in the manic cases. Characteristic personality type is outgoing. Unexplainable psychosis is rare (20 per cent). Most have disturbing circumstances at the time of onset. Oldest and youngest siblings may more frequently develop psychoses. Somatic handicaps frequently contribute to or help to precipitate the illness. Abrupt onset is rare except in manics. The condition usually requires one to six months to develop. Suicidal risk or attempt occurred in 30 per cent of all cases. The affective picture is often mixed, not purely as sadness or elation. Psychoneurotic (not often as anxiety), schizophrenic, and arteriosclerotic components are frequent (79 cases). (33.1 per cent). Thinking disturbances are present in one-fourth of the cases (manic and depressive phases). Capacity for rapport is fair or good in 41 per cent of the manics and in 70 per cent of the depressions. Some insight is present in 47 per cent of the manics and in 54 per cent of the depressions. Remissions of 10-20 years are common (67 cases, 32.2 per cent). Depression may begin early, but rarely (3.8 per cent, 8 cases), or late (65+, 11 cases, 5.2 per cent). The largest incidence occurs in the decade 45-55. Course is a matter of months; on the average 2½ months in the hospital. Three-fourths of the cases are well or improved at the time of discharge; 93 per cent recover from the first attack. Chronic cases are rare (16, 7.7 per cent). Cyclothymic cases tend oftener to chronicity. Single attacks are rare (21 per cent). Recurrence is likely. Long-term follow-up convinces us that caution is necessary in pronouncing recovery for the future. Seventy-nine per cent had recurrences. This is particularly true for cyclothymic cases. Many variations in course and phases occur. Depression following elation is more common than vice versa. Depression almost always lurks behind elation. Manic patients may suicide. Depressive or paranoid content occurred in 14 of the manic cases (77.7 per cent). Depressive cases may show definite manic features (spurts of elation in the morning, rhyming and flight with sadness). Single attacks of manic psychosis are very rare. Single attacks of depression occurred in 40 cases (19.2 per cent). Fourteen of these became chronic (35 per cent of 40 and 6.8 per cent of 208). The unfavorable depressions may develop a schizophrenic picture. Deterioration may occur in depression. Stupor in depression occurs—catatonic in appearance. First attacks on the average last 6½ months. Recovery from first attack is almost invariable (93 per cent). Twenty-one per cent had single attacks; 79 per cent had recurrent illnesses; 63.5 per cent had third attacks, and 45.1 per cent had fourth attacks. Attacks tend to become prolonged as they recur, especially after 45. Best prospect for recovery for patients having first attack is between 21 and 30, poorer after 40, worst after 50. Recovered patients show small number of attacks (2.7) and shortening of the course in subsequent attacks. The more frequent the attacks, the less chance for ultimate recovery. Depth of psychosis is not significantly important. Negative heredity is not an outstanding factor in recovery. Out-going make-up is a factor in recovered cases.",

      "abstract": "Hauptmerkmal der körperdysmorphen Störung (KDS) ist eine übermäßige Beschäftigung mit einem wahrgenommenen Makel oder Defekt im körperlichen Aussehen (z. B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "abstract": "Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness due to damage of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological condition for young adults in the United States, affecting approxi? mately 250,000 people. Sexuality and fertility are important concerns for this population since the onset of MS generally occurs between ages 20 and 40. MS is typified by lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, particularly the periventricular region in the brain and the tracts of the optic nerves and chiasm, brainstem, and spinal cord (Adams & Victor, 1981). Nerve conduction in these areas may be entirely impeded, or impaired on a partial or intermittent basis. Consequently, MS produces a variety of symptoms that may change as disease activity fluctuates. Although studies of sexual function in MS patients have been limited, surveys of male patients reveal that 44% to 77% report unspecified difficulties in the orgasm phase of the sexual response cycle (Lilius, Valtonen, & Wikstrom, 1976; Minderhoud, Leemhuis, Kremer, Laban, & Smits, 1984; Valleroy & Kraft, 1984). Abnormalities in orgasmic sensation or ejaculation of semen can be detrimental to sexual pleasure and fertility. Most clinicians treating sexual dysfunction in men with MS have focused narrowly on erectile dysfunction, which is reported by 63% to 80% of men with MS (Goldstein, Siroky, Sax, & Krane, 1982; Lilius et al, 1976; Minderhoud et al, 1984; Valleroy & Kraft, 1984). Unfor? tunately, urologists and mental health clinicians often overlook orgasm phase dysfunctions when a patient seeks help for an erection problem (Schover & Jensen, 1988). Some men with erectile dysfunction can reach orgasm with a flaccid penis and would be willing to continue noncoital sexual activity despite impaired erections. For them, im? paired orgasm remains an important handicap. Others are candidates for a penile prosthesis or intracavernous injection therapy (Montague, 1988; Segraves & Schoenberg, 1985), but have unrealistic expectations that these treatments to enhance penile rigidity will also resolve prob-",

The frequency of the individual symptoms does not correspond to what is stated in the literature: in particular, only less than 80 % complain of hot flushes, a noteworthy 69 % of disorders of the joints and muscles, and 53 % of sexual dysfunction. The responsiveness to hormone replacement therapy does not correspond to the frequency: functional disorders of the heart, for example (which only 42 % of the patients report as a symptom), react positively in 97 % of cases, and sexual dysfunction, which occurs in only 53 % of cases, reacts positively in at least 74 % of these. How soon improvement begins also varies according to the symptom. Whereas hot flushes, sleep disturbances and nervousness react quickly (within 10 days) and intensively, for disorders of the joints and muscles, and sexual dysfunction, there is an average delay of up to several months. Moderately severe and slight symptoms react to hormone replacement therapy in a manner similar to the severe symptoms and not, in fact, more or less. If, for example, hot flushes disappear under the therapy, but sexual dysfunction initially does not, it is entirely possible for improvement in this symptom to occur later.

Although few reports of RE exist in the literature, clinical investigators, through largely nonexperimental methods and case studies, have reported a variety of characteristics, behavioral patterns, personality traits, and etiologies associated with the disorder. A review of RE is provided to describe the disorder and compare current treatment procedures. In addition, it is suggested that rational-emotive therapy (RET), which has not been described previously in the RE literature, be utilized as an adjunct to behavioral therapies directed at altering the dysfunctional symptomatology.",

      "title": "Displays of inappropriate sexual behaviour by patients with progressive cognitive impairment: the forgotten form of challenging behaviour?",
      "abstract": "Accessible summary • Individuals with cognitive impairment may display a range of challenging behaviours such as agitation, aggression or inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB). • ISB incorporates any verbal or physical action of a sexual nature displayed within an inappropriate social context. • Although ISB is less common than other forms of challenging behaviour, it may still have a range of deleterious effects on the victims health. • Nurses are at risk of being exposed to ISB and this article will provide a useful insight to the nursing profession of this phenomenon. Abstract Persons with progressive cognitive impairment such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease may display an array of challenging behaviours. For instance, levels of agitation and aggression have been reported as high as 33% in home-dwelling individuals and 80% in those residing in institutions. One form of challenging behaviour that may be displayed by this group is inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB), but it is often overshadowed by other behaviours such as aggression. Inappropriate sexual behaviour involves any verbal of physical action of a sexual nature which is displayed in an inappropriate social context. Examples of ISB include: exposure of genitals in public/ward environments, ‘groping’ of nurses and masturbation in public areas. It has been estimated that the prevalence of ISB ranges from 2% to 17% of individuals with progressive cognitive impairment. Although it is less frequent than other challenging behaviours, it still may have significant deleterious effects on the victim's health. This paper is a review of the available literature on the nature, effects and management of ISB in persons with progressive cognitive impairment. Possible avenues for future research are also explored.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Effects of SSRIs on Sexual Function",
      "abstract": "Sexual problems are highly prevalent in both men and women and are affected by, among other factors, mood state, interpersonal functioning, and psychotropic medications.The incidence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is difficult to estimate because of the potentially confounding effects of the illness itself, social and interpersonal comorbidities, medication effects, and design and assessment problems in most studies. Estimates of sexual dysfunction vary from a small percentage to more than 80%. This article reviews current evidence regarding sexual side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the sexual side effects most commonly associated with SSRIs are delayed ejaculation and absent or delayed orgasm. Sexual desire (libido) and arousal difficulties are also frequently reported, although the specific association of these disorders to SSRI use has not been consistently shown. The effects of SSRIs on sexual functioning seem strongly dose-related and may vary among the group according to serotonin and dopamine reuptake mechanisms, induction of prolactin release, anticholinergic effects, inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase, and propensity for accumulation over time. A variety of strategies have been reported in the management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, including waiting for tolerance to develop, dosage reduction, drug holidays, substitution of another antidepressant drug, and various augmentation strategies with 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2), 5-HT3, and [small alpha, Greek]2 adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5-HT1A and dopamine receptor agonists, and phosphodiesterase (PDE5) enzyme inhibitors. Sexual side effects of SSRIs should not be viewed as entirely negative; some studies have shown improved control of premature ejaculation in men. The impacts of sexual side effects of SSRIs on treatment compliance and on patients' quality of life are important clinical considerations. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1999;19:67-85)",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

To date, there is no consensus on the treatment for RGS.A 58-year-old woman presented with persistent and unwanted genital arousal in her clitoris and labia minora. The arousal symptoms were accompanied by restless legs. Despite the pre-orgasmic feelings, orgasm was not achieved. Sexual activity did not resolve the symptoms.

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

Symptoms are often mild, but can be severe enough to substantially affect daily activities. About 5–8% of women thus suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS); most of these women also meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Mood and behavioral symptoms, including irritability, tension, depressed mood, tearfulness, and mood swings, are the most distressing, but somatic complaints, such as breast tenderness and bloating, can also be problematic. We outline theories for the underlying causes of severe PMS, and describe two main methods of treating it: one targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis, and the other targeting brain serotonergic synapses. Fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels trigger the symptoms, and thus interventions that abolish ovarian cyclicity, including long-acting analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or estradiol (administered as patches or implants), effectively reduce the symptoms, as can some oral contraceptives. The effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, taken throughout the cycle or during luteal phases only, is also well established.",

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

Tremor was most common (50%) followed by dystonia, myoclonus, and parkinsonism. Clinical descriptions of various types are reviewed. Clinical characteristics common in these patients included distractability (86%), abrupt onset (54%), and selective disabilities (39%). Distractability seems to be most important in tremor and least important in dystonia. Other diagnostic clues included entrainment of tremor to the frequency of repetitive movements of another limb, fatigue of tremor, stimulus sensitivity, and previous history of psychogenic illness. On examination, 71% had other psychogenic features. Over 60% had a clear history of a precipitating event and secondary gain and 50% had a psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression). Twenty five per cent of patients presented with combined psychogenic movement disorder and organic movement disorder; 35% resolved and this subgroup had a shorter duration of disease than those who are unresolved. Psychogenic movement disorder represents an uncommon diagnosis among patients with movement disorders. The ability to make a diagnosis rests on the presence of a multitude of clinical clues and therapeutic action should be taken as early as possible.",

It has been established that factors of higher risk of the transformation of a menopausal preneurosis-like condition into a neurosis-like one in women with a history of complete or partial castration are as follows: older (over 45 years) age by the time of surgical intervention, complete castration, a combination of the previous operation and attendant additional hazards (psychogenias and somatogenias) as well as the occurrence of the menopause before the operation. In the pubertal period behavioural deviations and neuropsychic disturbances usually reach a degree of obvious pathology (psychopathies, psychogenias) in cases where a long-standing psychotraumatic situation is combined with unfavourable biological factors such as minimum brain deficit, severe and prolonged debilitating somatic disease, a shain of infections, and pathological heredity.",

      "abstract": "De los muchos tipos de problemas que se presentan y que ven los profesionales de los servicios de salud mental, de dependencia química y de salud en general, ninguno supone un reto tan grande como el paciente que experimenta una alteración crónica del estado de ánimo, una adaptación social marginal, altos niveles de aislamiento interpersonal, conflicto y/o estrés diario y, con frecuencia, una conducta autodestructiva recurrente. Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas.

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children.

      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Like for other side effects oral contraceptives are often blamed for inducing depressive illness. Psychiatric literature and own data permit the following statements: 1. OC's do not induce psychiatric symptoms like depression on a pharmacological basis. 2. There is no preponderance of psychiatric symptoms during pill use. 3. If there is any effect on mood, initiative or affection this is more likely to be mentioned in patients with psychiatric history. 4. The indication for oral contraception in neurotic-psychopathic personalities should be considered seriously. 5. There is a positive secondary psychotropic effect of OC's via improving acne, bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhoea.Psychotropic effects have been imputed to oral contraceptives (OCs); however, studies with large populations found no depressive episodes caused by OCs. Affective disorders of women such as premenstrual syndrome and postpartum and menopausal depression are well-known. The estrogen and progesterone levels are high during pregnancy, when the risk of emotional disease declines. A study on Marvelon (containing .15 mg of desogestrel and .03 mg of ethinyl estradiol) involving 27,000 women found a history of depression in 3%, but in 90% the symptoms disappeared after OC use. Other studies corroborated the finding that OCs exerted a stabilizing effect on emotional disorders. The overwhelming majority of women without psychiatric anamnesis did not suffer any mood fluctuations under OC use. In a study, 4327 women were interviewed at 3 and 6 months of OC use, and in 45.7% their sense of well-being improved, 30.3% were in a good frame of mind, and 21.2% had a slight deterioration of their sense of well-being. Neurotic and introverted persons tended to attribute affective disorders, weakness of concentration, sleep disturbances, and the avoidance of sex to OCs. With such individuals, OC indication requires particularly strict adherence to rules. The ability of Ocs to improve acne was analyzed when 1785 questionnaires were examined from 1958 women who had used Marvelon. 60% reported improvement of their acne, and 50% of the more severe cases improved. Dysmenorrhea and menstrual cycle disorders improved similarly. Body weight increase in insignificant with modern OCs. OCs exert a positive psychotropic effect through their ability to influence these conditions.",

KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder.

Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. Anxiety and worry associated with at least three of the following: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued, difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance.",

      "title": "Cyclical Premenstrual Psychosis - Sometimes It Is Your Hormones",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Menstrual psychosis is a broad term used to describe a number of disorders characterized by the acute onset of psychotic symptoms with brief duration, complete resolution of symptoms between episodes, with timing related to menses. This entity was first described in the 18th century, with only 27 confirmed cases using strict diagnostic criteria. While research into causation is limited, estrogen withdrawal is thought to precipitate psychotic symptoms. We describe a case of premenstrual psychosis successfully treated with use of transdermal hormonal contraception and extended menstrual cycling. Clinical Case: A 25-year-old non-binary biologic female (they/them/theirs) with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychogenic non-epileptiform seizures was referred to endocrinology for evaluation of recurrent psychotic symptoms associated with menses. They endorsed stable mental health symptoms on aripiprazole except during the seven days prior to their menstrual cycle. During this time they reported persistent auditory hallucinations along with dysmenorrhea, with symptoms resolving at the onset of menses. Timing of menarche was uncertain, however they reported oligomenorrhea until beginning oral contraceptives at age nineteen, after which they developed regular monthly cycles accompanied by psychotic symptoms. Pituitary and ovarian hormone levels were unable to be assessed due to hormonal contraception. Prolactin was 8.3 ng/mL (3-30 ng/mL). In order to limit hormonal fluctuations from daily oral contraceptive pills and monthly withdrawal, the decision was made to transition to transdermal norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol patches changed weekly, with extended cycling to allow one menstrual cycle every three months. At follow-up visit nine months later they reported resolution of auditory hallucinations on this regimen, with symptoms recurring only during extreme stress. Conclusions: While the etiology of menstrual psychosis is unclear, described treatments include a combination of neuroleptics and hormonal therapy, including estrogen, progesterone, and GnRH agonists. As symptoms did not resolve until suppression of monthly menstrual cycles, this case supports the estrogen withdrawal hypothesis. Our case adds to the literature both in that transdermal, rather than oral or injectable therapy was used, and treatment was successful in alleviating the patient’s psychotic symptoms, improving their mental health and quality of life.

      "abstract": "Abstract Besides somatic experiences such as vasomotor symptoms, and sexual difficulties related to atrophy of the vagina, the climacteric is frequently associated with psychological symptoms. However, no evidence exists that psychological symptoms are directly related to hormonal changes during the climacteric. Psychological and social factors not specifically related to the climacteric appear to be an important predictor of psychological complaints during this period. Menopause has for long been regarded as a deficiency disease, requiring medical attention and hormone replacement therapy. However, it may be concluded that oestrogen is only a specific treatment for hot flushes and dyspareunia, but has no clear role in the management of psychological symptoms in menopausal women. A multifactorial approach, paying attention simultaneously to biological, psychological and social factors supposed to influence complaints during the climacteric may be more appropriate. A description of an integration of medical and cognitive‐behavioural treatment procedures in case of climacteric symptoms is given.",

Such evidence is poor also because suicidal patients were systematically excluded from clinical trials, for ethical reasons. Several key ideas are important in the management of the suicidal person. First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

      "title": "From Onset and Prodromal Stage to a Life-Long Course of Schizophrenia and Its Symptom Dimensions: How Sex, Age, and Other Risk Factors Influence Incidence and Course of Illness",
      "abstract": "The core symptoms of psychosis-delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders-are not unique to the disorder traditionally called schizophrenia. They occur at the early stages of various brain diseases, too. Psychosis seems to be a preformed pattern of response of the human brain. Most schizophrenia onsets are marked by a prodromal stage extending over several years and producing the maximum of social consequences. Schizophrenia incidence shows a steep increase culminating at age 15 to 25 years in males. In females it reaches a first peak at age 15 to 30 years and a second, flatter peak at menopausal age (44-49 years). Thereafter, incidence declines to a plateau at later ages. Unlike what the findings of most large-scale epidemiological studies applying an upper age limit of 45 to 55 years suggest, schizophrenia is a disorder of all ages. The lifetime risk seems to be the same for both sexes. The lower incidence in premenopausal women is accounted for by the downregulating effect of oestrogen on dopamine receptors. This hormonal protective effect is antagonised by the genetic effect of a high familial load. In the long-term illness course, right-censored to 11.2 years following first admission, the number of psychotic relapse episodes ranges from 0 to 29 with a mean of 3. The positive symptom dimension produces the highest number of relapses and the shortest duration of exacerbations with a mean length of two months. The depressive and negative symptom dimensions show exacerbations extending over nearly six months on average. Following the first illness episode symptom scores decline sharply, reaching a plateau five years after first admission. Negative symptoms come to a plateau after 2 to 3 years in females and after 5 years in males. Depression is the most frequent type of symptom in the long-term course. In the light of these results urgent treatment issues will be discussed.",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "The dexamethasone suppression test: an overview of its current status in psychiatry. The APA Task Force on Laboratory Tests in Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has had unprecedented evaluation among biological tests proposed for clinical use in psychiatry. It is hypothesized to reflect pathophysiologic changes at the CNS level. The sensitivity of the DST (rate of a positive outcome, or nonsuppression of cortisol) in major depression is modest (about 40%-50%) but is higher (about 60%-70%) in very severe, especially psychotic, affective disorders, including major depression with psychotic as well as melancholic features, mania, and schizoaffective disorder. The specificity (true negative outcome) of the DST in normal control subjects is above 90%, but it varies from less than 70% to more than 90% in psychiatric conditions that often need to be separated from major affective disorders. In dementia the specificity is even lower. In addition, a number of medical conditions, including severe weight loss and use of alcohol and certain other drugs (barbiturates, anticonvulsants, and others), can produce false positive results. Positive initial DST status in major depression does not add significantly to the likelihood of antidepressant response, and a negative test is not an indication for withholding antidepressant treatment. Some recent data suggest that DST-positive depressions (cortisol nonsuppression) are less likely than DST-negative cases (cortisol suppression) to respond to a placebo. If this is confirmed, it would increase the real magnitude of the difference in treatment response between DST-positive and DST-negative depressed patients. Failure to convert to normal suppression of cortisol with apparent recovery from depression suggests an increased risk for relapse into depression or suicidal behavior. Although the clinical utility of the DST as currently understood is limited, in certain specific situations its thoughtful use may aid clinical decision making. The association of an abnormal test result with major affective disorders encourages continued research on the DST.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

Definition and classificationJellinek believed that alcoholics are only people with alcoholism type Gamma, Delta and Epsilon.However distinguished the following types of alcoholism:• Alpha -a psychological (mental) dependence on alcohol, occurring in people who can not cope with stress and other difficult life situations.The current is too severe symptoms of impaired control over drinking alcohol.This type of alcohol can turn into a type of Gamma, but it can also stay largely unchanged for decades.• Beta -lack of psychological and physical symptoms of alcohol dependence.The problems relate mainly to somatic consequences of excessive drinking and symptoms of impaired control over drinking are not very visible.• Gamma -are present mental and physical symptoms of addiction, impaired (loss) of control over drinking, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance to alcohol change at the helm,• Delta -has to control the amount of alcohol consumed by a co inability to refrain from drinking.This type of alcoholism characterized by people who for weeks, months or years drink alcohol regularly low-interest to maintain a constant concentration in the blood and does not exhibit obvious symptoms of intoxication.• Epsilon -is characterized by the periodic occurrence of \"strings\" drinking interspersed with periods of complete abstinence.This type is also known as alcoholism dypsomanią [1].Some researchers add more to the classification of alcoholism Zeta type, diagnosed in individuals who under the influence of alcohol demonstrate antisocial behavior, including violence.Among other things, thanks to research Jelinek American Medical Association in 1956 adopted a decision on the qualification of alcoholism as a disease and not as a phenomenon of the circle of moral disorder.Also considered whether alcoholism is not called \"Jelinek disease.\"In",

      "title": "Awareness, Attitude and Performance of Men Regarding Premenstrual Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is thought to be a standout amongst the most widely recognized disorder among the women of reproductive age (1).It consists of a series of physical and psychological symptoms that start at the end of the premenstrual period and disappears with the onset of menstrual bleeding or the first few days after menstruation.The prevalence of PMS was estimated to be close to 80% in women of reproductive age (2).Symptoms of PMS include depression, hopelessness, emotional instability, irritability, loss of interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy, changes in appetite or excessive desire for food, changes in sleep habits along with physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, headache, feeling bloated and edema (3).The cause of PMS remains unknown and research findings suggest that it is multi-factorial (3).Several factors such as fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone hormones, endocrine disorders and a variety of estrogen receptors, prostaglandin synthesis and environmental factors such as alcohol consumption and stress are involved in its etiology (4).Typically, PMS is a disruptive and often a debilitating factor in the lives of many women (5) in a way that it might disrupt interpersonal relations and daily activities.Moreover, in case of exacerbations, it could affect the lifestyle and well-being of the individual.Behavioral changes made in this period have a noteworthy effect on the performance of families.These effects might lead to child abuse, criminal behavior as well as incompatibility with the spouse and a decrease in the quality of marital relationships (6,7).While men do not experience the effects of premenstrual physical and emotional changes directly, premenstrual changes might affect men by changing the dynamics of relationships (6) which could result in frustration, confusion, and helplessness (8-10).Although the PMS is a serious condition, it has received scant attention so far.Due to the absence of research on the subject and considering the high prevalence of PMS among married women of reproductive age and men's insufficient awareness of the subject along with the impact of this disorder on their lives and marital satisfaction, the need for the present investigation seems evident.The purpose of this study was to determine awareness, attitude, and performance of men regarding PMS among the patients who referred to the selected health centers of Urmia in 2016.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) belongs to the group of epilepsies with primarily generalized seizures as absence epilepsies, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as infantile and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

      "abstract": "Men with schizophrenia have an earlier age of onset, a somewhat inferior response to treatment and a generally poorer prognosis than women. These findings can perhaps be explained by the existence of two distinct forms of the illness, one with early onset, primarily affecting men, and one with later onset, primarily affecting women. There is not much evidence for this first view. Alternatively, non-specific cumulative stress factors may impinge selectively on the male, reaching the threshold of demonstrable illness at an earlier age. A third possibility is the existence of specific biological protective factors in the female, such as relatively bilateral representation of left hemisphere functions or relative dopaminergic inhibition by estrogens.",

The efficacy of symptom-onset dosing (medication taken only on luteal days when symptoms occur) needs further systematic study. Women going through the menopausal transition may need to adjust their antidepressant dosing regimen due to the change in frequency of menstruation.

      "abstract": "\"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders\" is a collective term that describes the continuum of disabilities, from mild to severe, accompanying the teratogenic effects of ethanol on the developing fetus. At the severe end of the spectrum is the subset of individuals with growth restriction, a distinctive pattern of facial dysmorphology, and cognitive and/or neurobehavioral effects (fetal alcohol syndrome), and at the mild end of the spectrum are those individuals with neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits who exhibit minimal or no growth or physical stigmata (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading cause of preventable developmental disabilities in the world. They occur much more commonly than previously recognized, with prevalence estimates from prospective school-based studies in the United States of 11.3–50.0 per 1000 children (~1–5%), and rates in special populations, such as the foster care system, as high as 169 per 1000 (~17%). An earlier diagnosis is associated with a better outcome and provides an opportunity to prevent the birth of another affected child in the family. Diagnosis, intervention, and prevention offer some of the greatest challenges to health care providers, families and their communities. Multidisciplinary diagnostic teams are available throughout North America and other parts of the world and can provide accurate and comprehensive assessments and management options for affected individuals. In this chapter, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children and adults with this common range of disabilities.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS in which psychoneurological symptoms prevail. For the diagnosis of PMDD, the specific DSM-5 criteria were developed by the American Psychiatric Association according to which the the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of five or more symptoms in women during the week prior to menstruation and their disappearance a few days after the onset of menstruation. These symptoms are observed for at least two cycles. Treatment of women with PMS/PMDD, first of all, should start with the lifestyle adjustment, inclusion of regular mode rate physical activity into daily activities. The effectiveness of vitamins B6, E and calcium has not been confirmed in studies. First-line drug therapy includes SSRIs or combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone are prescribed first, then agonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "abstract": "Patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) usually develop significant behavioral disturbances with progression of the disease. We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

      "title": "Psychological Management of Multiple Sclerosis An Overview",
      "abstract": "Eight case histories demonstrate features of the predisposing childhood background met with in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) together with the passive dependent coping mechanisms adopted by the child to ensure short-term survival, but which perpetuated into adult life are inadequate and somatically damaging. First, there is pathological dependence on a parental key figure later transferred wholly or partly to other key figures. The pathological dependence leads to ambivalence over separation from the key figure(s) and the attainment of an independent emotional existence. The childhood of MS patients is overwhelming because it is either turbulent or excessively cloying, and the child's response passive and docile. Other siblings, for reasons such as position in the sibship, or their sex, or inherited toughness, escape the full rigour of parental dominance, or successfully rebel against it. MS subjects are thus especially vulnerable to threats of illness, death or irretrievable severance from key figures but, while detachment is perilous, they also fear and resent engulfment and the loss of any small measure of identity they may have gained. With their infantile attempts at separation at age of 2–3 frustrated, or too feeble for success, and having learned the 'giving-up' response as their only defence against what they see as hopeless odds, it is hardly surprising that bids for independence at adolescence are equally unsuccessful. They often recall a few attempts at adolescent rebellion painfully and quickly put down by the threat of withdrawal by the key figure. Often these adolescent or adult attempts at independence are associated with sexual relationships bedevilled by guilt from early libidinous fantasies, and fears of being trapped into parenthood and responsibility thereby threatening their own position as the dependent child. It is, therefore, no accident that the onset and relapses of MS are commonly associated with the crises courtship, marriage and birth. The women, if they are childless, which is often the case because of their own hang-ups, not infrequently fantasise their sisters' or friends' babies as their own. Because of their superficial affability, men and women are vulnerable to the trauma of being made unwilling confidants especially in the sexual misdemeanours of their neighbours, friends, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, and identify closely with injured parties; such experiences are frequently provocative of onset nd relapse of MS. MS patients conceal emotions, particularly aggressive emotions, behind a mask. The mask they wear is either smiling, or 1 Based on a paper read to the Society for Psychosomatic Research, London 1976. Paulley 27 unsmiling and flat. The flat mask may incorrectly be interpreted as depression. The moria seen with the brain damage of GPI parallels the gross euphoria of advanced cases of MS, but both are caricatures of the basic mood antedating the disease. Relatives and friends as well as the patient will confirm that the smiling or unsmiling mask is premorbid and an early learned defence to conceal real feelings too dangerous to reveal. In this series there is a predominance of eldest and youngest children, and the histories reveal that they are often the most exposed to the damaging factors mentioned. However, the figures are just below the level of statistical significance. Likewise, the number of only children seemed to be more than one would expect. Psychotherapy is directed to helping these patients in the therapeutic situation to show their feelings, sometimes for the first time in their lives, and bring into consciousness their unconscious habit of hiding more intense feelings behind a smiling or unsmiling mask, and then to learn to lower their defensive mask, not only in the therapeutic situation, but later in their interpersonal relationships. Of necessity this programme also involves helping the patient wherever possible to separate emotionally from his key figure and surrogates. Experience has shown that this is more effectively and rapidly achieved by couple therapy in which the spouse or fiancé(e) affords an empathetic extension of the therapeutic situation beyond the consulting room. It is necessary to maintain therapy over the dangerous period during which dependence becomes attenuated first by substitution of the therapist for the key figure and later by incorporation of the 'good parent' and extrusion of the 'bad'. Subsequently, the link with the therapist may be weakened by spaced interviews but with easy access to the therapist in the event of relapse. Successful psychotherapy is punctuated by substantial remissions of the somatic symptoms of MS. Period of study 1946–1976, number of patients 300+, case notes traced and examined 227 (males 88, females 139).

Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence.

Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "In order to suggest therapy modifications with the aim of diminishing the risk of therapy-induced long-term distressful symptoms in cancer survivors, data are needed relating details of therapy to the long-term symptom situation. In this article, the concepts and means used to assess the latter while developing the Radiumhemmet scale for symptom assessment are described. The focus is on the subjective long-term situation, and symptoms as a perceived abnormality are defined. For conceptual clarity, one symptom at a time is considered, excluding scales in which items are summarized. Moreover, measures of disease occurrence in the population are translated (epidemiologically) into measures of symptom occurrence in an individual. Nature distinguishes one long-term symptom from another. Occurrence of a symptom in an individual is measured by an incidence (e.g. number of defecations per week) or prevalence rate (e.g. urinations with involuntary cessation divided by the total number of urinations). Any scale expressing symptom intensity is arbitrary, be it 'verbal' (no/little/moderate/much pain) or visual (analogue or with integers). A time period describes symptom duration. The relevance of a symptom to emotions and social activities, sometimes cited as the associated symptom-induced distress, is a separate issue from symptom occurrence, intensity, and duration.",

Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation.

Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen.

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development.

      "title": "Questions in psychiatry (<scp>QuiP</scp>): Psychological basis for sexual dysfunction in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "This article is the fifth in our series on sexual wellbeing and its core components. Together, these brief papers aim to provide a foundation of knowledge, which clinicians can draw upon when assessing sexual functioning. The present article is the first to focus on factors that may negatively impact sexual wellbeing and contribute to sexual dysfunction. Specifically, it examines psychosocial factors, which, along with neurophysiological factors, that will be considered separately in a future QuiP, often contribute to sexual problems. We begin by outlining foundational principles regarding the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual, and then build on this with further information that pertains specifically to individuals with mental illness. It is important to note that whilst DSM lists a number of formal sexual disorders, these are not common in routine in clinical practice and not easily assessed. Instead, in clinical assessments involving mental health it is far more useful to describe any sexual dysfunction that causes significant distress in terms of the actual symptoms the person is experiencing (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm). In addition, it is critical to bear in mind that sexual experiences are inherently psychological and subject to the attachment of personal meaning. These then guide our expectations of what our sexual experiences should entail. Although we have mentioned the importance of assessing sexual wellbeing previously, it is important to note that sexual dysfunction is surprisingly common. Indeed, it verges on being the norm with an estimated 45% of all couples experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction at some time or another.1 The most common sexual dysfunction reported by females is low sexual desire (33.4%), followed by inhibited orgasm (24.1%), whereas in males the most common problem is premature ejaculation (28.5%) followed by performance anxiety (17%).2 However, it is also very common for most individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction to feel as though they are among a rare minority experiencing such difficulties. This is because even though the topic of sex seems to be ubiquitous, sexual problems or difficulties are seldom discussed, and may not be disclosed even within a medical context. When examining the psychological components that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, the cognitive-behavioural-emotional (CBE) model serves as a useful framework. This is often utilized in cognitive behavioural therapeutic settings to address various kinds of sexual dysfunction. The CBE model posits that psychological components comprise cognitive, behavioural and emotional domains, which when disrupted can contribute to sexual dysfunction (see Figure 1). These domains are further divided into sub-components that interact with one another and when disturbed can contribute to the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunction. Considering cognitive schemas, these play a significant role in sexual wellbeing, and when negative thinking takes hold, it can impair sexual functioning. For example, following a negative sexual experience (e.g., erectile dysfunction, inhibited orgasm, pain), it is possible to develop a 'negative expectancy', which in turn may lead to performance anxiety. If then, in this context, performance is again poor, this reinforces and further entrenches the initial negative cognitions. Other cognitive factors that can play a role include unrealistic standards for sexual experience, which is increasingly common because of widespread exposure to pornography, and 'spectatoring' wherein an individual self-consciously monitors and evaluates their experience rather than focusing on the sensation of the experience itself. Both of these factors can be addressed with psychoeducation. Typically, it is cognitive factors such as these that are amongst the primary factors that have triggered and maintained sexual dysfunction. For example, if a woman has an assumption that women should always orgasm during sex, but this then does not occur on a few occasions in her experiences, she may develop negative attributions regarding the cause, such as 'I am flawed, … something is wrong with me, … something is wrong with my relationship'. This can then lead to feelings of anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and even shame. In addition, she may develop negative expectancies regarding sex, resulting in avoidance and withdrawal from sexual activities. Thus, a cycle is created and perpetuated, and this can result in what then seems to be a sustained loss of sexual interest, increased anxiety, and depression. The above example demonstrates how sexual dysfunction can be deconstructed into its psychological constituents and traced back to contributing factors, which can then be systematically addressed. The importance of sexual functioning in patients with psychiatric disorders has been discussed previously in this series, and more broadly is recognised as an important domain to assess for overall functioning. Thus, identifying potential psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important, as it may provide an explanation for the problems the person is experiencing, and perhaps also identify an amenable target for interventions. In addition, as sexual functioning serves as a key indicator of overall functioning, especially in those with mental illnesses where it can serve as an indicator of recovery, addressing any psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important. It should be noted at this juncture, that sexual dysfunction and the psychological and physiological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, are all interconnected and thus there is a significant degree of overlap and co-occurrence between these components. Hence, our separation is purely pragmatic, and in practice, the two sets of factors should be considered jointly. For example, depression and anxiety often co-occur with physical health conditions such as obesity,4 and any one of a number of individual factors related to these conditions can cause, or be caused by, sexual dysfunction. In reality, a combination of factors is likely to have contributed to these problems and many of these will have a bidirectional causal relationship between sexual dysfunction and mental health. Thus, taking a holistic approach when assessing sexual functioning is critical. When assessing psychological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, it is important to bear in mind that these factors are not necessarily and specifically related to sexual dysfunction per se, but that they can negatively impact functioning more generally. Thus, the psychological factors that need to be assessed during a routine psychiatric assessment remain largely the same. In addition, it is their potential impact on the domain of sexual functioning that needs to be given further consideration. Note, this is alongside their impact on other domains of functioning such as an individual's occupation, and relationships (discussed in previous Quip—'Assessing sexual dysfunction in clinical practice'). To exemplify the bidirectional relationship between sexual functioning and psychological factors, consider the observation that healthy sexual functioning usually alleviates stress, but that sexual dysfunction can also lead to psychological problems. Thus, many mental illnesses are associated with dysfunction across a variety of sexual domains. Further, once stress has produced sexual dysfunction, this can itself lead to further stress exacerbating the problems the individual is already experiencing. Trauma, is another significant psychological factor which is increasingly assessed in routine clinical practice. This encompasses various forms of childhood abuse and neglect (sexual, physical, and emotional) and traumatic events experienced in adulthood (see Figure 2). The impact of trauma on domains of functioning (education, occupation, social) is also often assessed in clinical practice; however, its impact on sexual functioning is seldom explored, if at all. It is therefore important to note that trauma can significantly compromise sexual functioning, regardless of the nature and timing of the trauma. In other words, the trauma does not necessarily have to be sexual in nature or have occurred during a critical developmental period for it to have an effect on sexual functioning in an individual. For example, sexual dysfunction is a known symptom in combat veterans with PTSD,5 and therefore, the contribution of trauma to sexual dysfunction should be considered broadly as possible and explored as a potential target for interventions. As pointed out earlier, mental illnesses impact a number of key psychological domains that can negatively impact sexual functioning. The most common mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, which often co-occur and occur alongside other disorders, entail a number of overlapping symptoms which negatively impact sexual functioning and wellbeing. For example, the symptoms of depression can be captured across 3 domains namely, activity, cognition, and emotion (for further detailed explanation, see The ACE Model*). In the domain of activity, the symptoms of fatigue, increased or decreased sleep and weight/appetite, can all impact sexual functioning due to a lack of energy, or impact self-esteem due to changes in weight that alter self-image and confidence. In the domain of cognition, impaired attention and concentration and psychomotor changes can interfere with sexual functioning by limiting mental engagement and preventing psychological arousal and stimulation. Finally, symptoms within the domain of emotion, such as anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and depressed mood can all reduce or eliminate libido, which is essential for healthy sexual functioning. A common bedfellow of depression is anxiety, which when excessive can manifest as a disorder. Several symptoms of anxiety disorders overlap with those of depression, and therefore it is not surprising that anxiety can impair sexual functioning. As mentioned above, difficulties in concentration, disturbances in sleep and fatigue can all diminish sexual desire and the ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices. Furthermore, generalized anxiety may extend to more specific anxiety regarding sexual functioning and performance, and can also cause erectile dysfunction, and anorgasmia in women. Aside from such specific psychiatric disorders, there are some general symptoms that occur in many mental illnesses and can have a significant impact on sexual functioning, regardless of diagnosis. For example, lowered self-esteem that stems from having a mental illness along with the stigma and shame that this may confer, can significantly threaten the integrity of one's sense of self. Understandably then, this can constrain the individual's ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices even solo activities—especially if libido is also diminished or lost altogether. In this way, having a mental illness places an additional strain on romantic relationships and interferes with intimacy, all of which makes it difficult to form and sustain relationships. In this brief piece, the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual have been outlined, and then building on this, the additional psychological factors that occur within the context of psychiatric disorders have been explored. Importantly, many of these factors are already typically assessed in routine clinical practice, however their impact on sexual function is often overlooked. Furthermore, many of these psychological factors are not necessarily specific to any particular diagnosis, therefore it is important to bear these in mind in all patients. Finally, this relationship is bidirectional, and thus when assessing sexual dysfunction, it is equally important to examine its potential psychological sequelae.

Stress can exert various negative effects on the body ranging from alterations in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death. Erectile dysfunction can be a manifestation of chronic stress. ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction that affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. ED may result from many etiologic factors like psychogenic, endocrino- logic, neurogenic, arteriogenic or venoocclusive dysfunction. These factors are not mutually exclusive and multi- ple factors contribute to ED in many patients. According to modern science Psychogenic factors frequently coex- ist with other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. A patient aged 35 years came to the OPD of A&amp;U Tibbia college with complaints of inability to initiate and maintain erection along with abnormal vision, dizziness, retrosternal burning, indigestion, heaviness in chest and disinterest. He was advised for Shirodhara along with counselling (Satvvajaychikitsa) and after a couple of days, there was a significant improvement in pa- tient.

La existencia de un trastorno explica en gran parte la asociación entre la mayoría de las variables socioeconómicas (sexo, matrimonio, nivel educativo) y la suicidalidad. Los trastornos depresivos son el factor de riesgo principal, riesgo asociado probablemente a un episodio actual justo antes del intento. La asociación con episodios depresivos de un trastorno de ansiedad o la existencia de rasgos impulsivos (trastorno de la personalidad del grupo B, abuso de drogas o ambos) aumenta el riesgo de actuación. La ideación suicida y los intentos de suicidio muestran curvas de comienzo paralelas con picos entre los 14-20 años de edad, con la existencia de un diagnóstico previo del DSM-III-R como un predictor poderoso. El número de trastornos asociados aumenta linealmente la probabilidad de intentar el suicidio y es el único predictor significativo de la mortalidad.

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "title": "SAT0198 PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT IN PRIMARY SJOGREN’S SYNDROME – UNCOMMON OR UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM?",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background:</h3> Systemic manifestations are common in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and play a major role in the prognosis. Neurological complications may affect both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The incidence varies from several to several dozen percent. The course of the disease and the severity of the symptoms may be mild and self-limiting or progressive, leading to permanent neurological deficits. It is worth remembering that the symptoms of nervous system involvement may precede the onset of symptoms of dryness, and diagnosis of pSS may be delayed after a certain duration of neurological symptoms. <h3>Objectives:</h3> The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of PNS involvement among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with the diagnosis of pSS in our University Clinical Centre. <h3>Methods:</h3> We studied a consecutive group of fifty unselected patients aged from 33 to 74 years (mean 55.8 years). All patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of pSS. Additional connective tissue diseases and diabetes were the exclusion criteria. Disease activity was evaluated according to the EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI). All patients underwent clinical neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of nine peripheral nerves. For the classification of polyneuropathies the ESTEEM (European Standardized Telematic tool to Evaluate Electrodiagnostic Methods) guidelines were used. Clinical examination and nerve conduction study were performed and evaluated by one certified neurologist. <h3>Results:</h3> Of our 50 patients, 48 were female with a mean (±SD) age 53.6±10.5 years and mean disease duration 7.9±5.3 years. Two were male with mean age 43.7±25.8 years and mean disease duration 5.7±0.6 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.4±14 years. 23 (46%) patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of neuropathy. The most common PNS manifestation was sensorimotor neuropathy 11/23 (47%), mononeuropathy was present in 6/23 (26%) patients, pure axonal sensory neuropathy was present in 1/23 (4.3%) patient, axonal motor neuropathy in 1/23 (4.3%), SFN in 1/23 (4.3%) and cranial nerve involvement was present in 4/23 (17.4%) (one of the patients had both cranial and sensorimotor neuropathy). Neurological symptoms preceded the diagnosis of pSS in 8 (35%) of 23 PNS+ patients. The frequency of following symptoms and extraglandular manifestations was significantly higher in PNS+ compared to PNS- patients: salivary gland enlargement (74% vs 44% p&lt;0,05), respiratory tract involvement (65% vs 37% p&lt;0,05) and lymphadenopathy (61% vs 19% p&lt;0,05). The mean ESSDAI in patients with and without neurological involvement was 7±6,82 and 4,7±4,58 respectively (p=0.245). In this subgroup the use of cyclophosphamide, due to extraglandular manifestations, was increased (p&lt;0,05). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> We found that PNS involvement is a common extraglandular manifestation of pSS (46% in our group). Sensorimotor neuropathies were most frequent. Involvement of the PNS seems frequent but remains underestimated. NCS is a non-invasive test which might be useful at diagnosis and follow-up. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathies in patients with pSS are needed. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "Masturbation, or self-stimulation of the genitalia is a common human behavior, said to occur in 90–94% of males and 50–60% of females at some time in their lives [1]. Infantile masturbation is highlighted because masturbatory behavior has been often mistaken for epilepsy due to usual presentation with paroxysmal movements of recurrent character [2]. Infantile masturbation can also mimic other conditions such as abdominal pain, paroxysmal dystonia and dyskinesia [3, 4]. Masturbatory activity in infant and young children is difficult to recognize because it has a spectrum of different behavior patterns, which often do not involve manual stimulation of the genitalia. Misdiagnosis consequently may lead to unnecessary investigations and treatment [2,3]. The condition is more often seen in girls than in boys (65% among 31 patients in Nechay at al. [5], all 12 patients were girls in Yang et al. [4]). It often starts at age under 1 year of life. Episodes are usually observed when the child is sitting in a car seat, when he/she is bored or tired and in relation to the transition between waking and sleeping [5]. During the events of masturbation children exhibit different types of behavior: dystonia-like posturing of different parts of the body has been most often seen, grunting, flushing and sweating are also very typical; rocking and assumed eidetic imagery (seeing ‘telly in the sky’) can also be observed",

      "abstract": "Importance Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning. Observations Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.55 [95% CI, −0.64 to −0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, −0.67 [95% CI, −0.76 to −0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, −0.30 [95% CI, −0.37 to −0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39 [small to medium effect[ [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65]), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care. Conclusions and Relevance Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.",

In cases of death, it is difficult to relate it to the sexual practice itself. Suicide and homicide are the main differential diagnoses. Closely related derivatives of asphyxiophilic sex are anesthesiophilia (inhalation of variable volatile substances) and electrophilia (use of electric current during sexual activity)--both also intended to enhance the sexual stimulation. These forms of sexual practice are less prevalent than asphyxiophilia.",

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms, due either major depression or clinically significant, subsyndromal depression, occur commonly in the course of Alzheimer's disease. For a variety of clinical and methodological reasons, this remains an area that begs for new investigation. At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

It was found that the closest relationship between the level of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, etc.) is observed in the case of delayed experience of a dangerous disease, which allows us to consider it as a special existential situation.",

Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Allostatic Overload Syndrome in Patients with Chronic Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "Allostasis, the ability to maintain stability through change, is a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. When allostatic systems are turned on and turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not otherwise survive. However, in a number of circumstances allostatic systems may either be overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has been termed 'allostatic load', or the price of adaptation [1]. Findings from several studies suggest that it is associated with worse health conditions and plays a significant role in the susceptibility, course, and outcome of cardiovascular (CV) diseases [2]. Recently, Fava et al. [3] introduced clinimetric criteria for assessing allostatic overload syndrome (AOS) based on: (a) current identifiable sources of distress in the form of acute or chronic stress (the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual's coping skills when its full nature and circumstances are evaluated), and (b) psychiatric symptoms (DSM-IV) or psychosomatic symptoms (DCPR) or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or in psychological well-being occurring within 6 months after the onset of the stressor.This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the AOS of Fava et al. [3] in patients with chronic CV disease and its relationships with psychosomatic syndromes (Structured Interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research; DCPR [4]), psychopathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; SCID [5]), illness representations (Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised; IPQ-R [6]), and psychosocial functioning (12-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-12 [7]). To evaluate AOS, recent and chronic stress, environmental mastery, sleep, somatization, and psychological distress were carefully evaluated in the clinical interview.Consecutive outpatients with essential hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled between January and December 2011. Patients with severe CV comorbidity, psychosis, oncology and autoimmune diseases, cognitive impairment, and current alcohol or any other substance abuse were excluded. For all patients, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure were recorded at the entry. All patients gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Because of refusal to participate, clinical problems, and other difficulties, 116 of 138 patients (84%) entered the study (84 with essential hypertension and 32 with CHD). The clinical characteristics and scale scores of patients with and without AOS are shown in table 1.No differences in CV and sociodemographic variables were found between the two groups, except for younger age in the AOS patients. Patients with AOS showed significant poorer mental functioning (SF-12 MCS), higher scores on the IPQ-R consequences (perception of severity and effects of the illness on individual life) and emotional representations (emotional reactivity to the illness) subscales, and a higher prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses. Furthermore, a 2-fold significant higher prevalence of DCPR clusters of abnormal illness behavior, irritability, and somatization (though the latter was near to statistical significance) was found in the AOS group compared to the comparison group. It is noteworthy that DCPR demoralization was more than 5-fold higher in AOS patients than in those without AOS. Also, the DCPR syndrome of illness denial was diagnosed 3 times more frequently in the AOS (31%) group than in the comparison (10%) group [χ2(1) = 4.82, p = 0.03]. Logistic regression analysis was used with AOS as the dependent variable and DSM and DCPR syndrome illness representation, psychosocial functioning, and sociodemographic characteristics as independent variables. The final model was statistically significant (χ2 = 31.46, p < 0.001; Cox and Snell R2 = 0.24) and AOS was found to be independently predicted by DCPR demoralization [B = 1.807 (SE 0.849); Wald statistic 4.530 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.03; Exp (B) = 6.090 (95% CI 1.154–32.153)] and SF-12 MCS [B = –0.099 (SE 0.040); Wald statistic 5.978 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.01; Exp (B) = 0.906 (95% CI 0.837–0.981)].In this exploratory study we showed for the first time, to our knowledge, the prevalence of AOS in outpatients with chronic CV illness. Within this sample, AOS is characterized by poorer psychosocial functioning, higher rates of psychopathology, and a higher disease-related emotional burden (perception of the impact of the illness on individual life) with associated correlates of abnormal illness behavior, somatization symptoms, and irritability. It is of interest that AOS partially and independently overlapped with demoralization, a feeling state characterized by an inability to cope with problems, hopelessness, and helplessness [8] which may dramatically increase the subjective perception of being overloaded by stressful demands, as shown by the association with the mental component score of SF-12. Recently, Offidani and Ruini [9] found a much higher prevalence of AOS (41%) compared to our results (11%). The marked difference with the report of Offidani and Ruini [9] might be likely due to a number of reasons including sampling (they recruited blood donors on a voluntary basis vs. consecutive CV outpatients), procedure (they recruited healthy volunteers who might be more interested in participating in a psychological evaluation because of experienced distress), age (they recruited younger subjects aged an average of 37 years while our patients had a mean age of 66), work status (more than half of their subjects were employed while two third of our subjects were retired, with a consequent different weight of work-related stress), and assessment instruments (they did not use SCID and DCPR but cut off criteria to self-report scales).Our study includes obvious limitations dues to its preliminary nature such as a limited sample size, cross-sectional design, lack of assessment of biological (e.g. erythrocites, leukocytes, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin), metabolic (waist-hip ratio), and behavioral (smoking status, diet, alcohol, and coffee consumption) data that are relevant for both CV illness and allostatic load. Nonetheless, our findings show that a reliable evaluation of allostatic overload may help to identify those conditions that, by exceeding individual resources, may constitute a danger to health such as demoralization. The relevance of diagnosing AOS is particularly important in cardiology because of the established association of chronic stress with negative prognostic factors. Furthermore, diagnosing AOS may help target treatment to psychological functions enhancing well-being outcomes [10].",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Child Abuse Syndrome (CAS): A Newly Recognized Distinct Entity",
      "abstract": "A number of children and adolescents experience stressful events during their life spans, which can affect them both physically and emotionally. Their reactions to these events are usually time-limited, as most of these children recover without further problems. However, a child or an adolescent may experience a severe traumatic event, including situations where someone's life (especially parents’ lives) is threatened or where major injuries occur (e.g., victims or witnesses of physical/sexual abuse or of violence in the home or community, of a car accident, a natural disaster or a war event, or the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness); in these cases, the risk of developing a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) becomes more likely, and is directly related to the severity of the trauma experienced, to the likelihood of the trauma being repeated, and, when the trauma affects a child’s relative, also to the child’s relationship with the victim [1, 2].\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has recently proved that PTSD related to sexual abuse in children can manifest itself with unique clinical patterns, including specific signs and symptoms of varying degrees of intensity: losing interest in activities which normally gave them joy or pleasure, a regression to thumb-sucking, bedwetting or other age-inappropriate behaviors, also including loss of talking skills. Other leading hallmarks are the tendency to repeat some forms of behavior previously perpetrated against themselves; the development of a strong attachment to a parent or toward another reference figure; the manifestation of unusual fears regarding early death; and severe concentration problems interfering with learning or social activities. Additional potential consequences in adult life include suicidal thinking, active engagement in suicidal behavior and the onset of addictive relationships to food, alcohol or drugs [3, 4].\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, increasing evidence of the changes in brain structure and function occurring in abused children suffering from PTSD have been recorded by neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, PECT) and neurophysiological (EEG, ERP) studies on large cohorts, mainly including changes in the frontal-limbic networks, the hippocampus and the amygdala [5, 6]. In addition, clinical and molecular geneticists have suggested and demonstrated that abused children who develop PTSD experience a biologically specific form of the disorder different from those caused by other types of trauma, including distinct genomic alterations and unique epigenetic DNA methylation profiles [7, 8].\r\n\r\nAccording to this recent clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, genomic and epigenetic evidence, independently reported by separate teams of researchers, we propose that, for a better and more accurate clinical and diagnostic evaluation and understanding of the clinical phenotype, the overall manifestations and symptoms caused by child abuse be regarded as a specific and distinct entity, grouped under the term of “Child Abuse Syndrome” (CAS).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover. The woman dwells on the feelings she ascribes to her \"suitor.\" Such delusional thinking, resulting from an ego defect and producing bizarre actions, may be shaped largely by feelings of being unloved or even unloveable; a narcissistic blow is overcome by a grandiose fantasy.

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state characterised by fearfulness and unwanted and distressing physical symptoms.It is a normal and appropriate response to stress but becomes pathological when it is disproportionate to the severity of the stress, continues after the stressor has gone, or occurs in the absence of any external stressor.Neurotic disorders with anxiety as a prominent symptom are common: a recent British survey found that 16% of the population suffered from some form of pathological anxiety.Anxiety disorders should be differentiated from stress reactions, in which anxiety may be a prominent feature.These include acute stress reactions-a rapid response (in minutes or hours) to sudden stressful life events, leading to anxiety with autonomic arousal and some disorientation-and adjustment reactions-slower responses to life events (such as loss of job, moving house, or divorce) that occur days or weeks later as symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depression (without biological symptoms).These are generally self limiting and are helped by reassurance, ventilation, and problem solving.A more profound stress reaction, post-traumatic stress disorder, is described below.Until recently, the commonest response to a presentation of anxiety has been to prescribe a benzodiazepine.This has been much criticised and alternatives have been evaluated, including almost all the available antidepressants and psychological treatments, especially cognitive behaviour therapy.For most general practitioners, constraints on resources are likely to mean that drugs remain the mainstay of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affecting up to 7% of reproductive age women. Women with PMDD are of reproductive age; therefore, contraception and treatment of PMDD are important considerations. The disorder as described in the DSM-V is characterized by moderate to severe psychological, behavioral and physical symptoms beginning up to two weeks prior to menses, resolving soon after the onset of menstruation and significantly interfering with daily functioning. PMDD develops in predisposed individuals after they are exposed to progesterone at the time of ovulation. It has been hypothesized that PMDD is in part attributable to luteal phase abnormalities in serotonergic activity and to altered configuration of ℽ-aminobutyric acid subunit A (GABAA) receptors in the brain triggered by the exposure to the neuroactive steroid progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone (Allo). A large body of evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be effective in the treatment of PMDD. Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) pills, specifically the 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/3mg drospirenone in a 24/4 extended cycle regimen has been shown to significantly improve the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD. Other combined monophasic, extended cycle hormonal contraceptive pills with less androgenic progestins may also be helpful, although not well studied. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are recommended for those not seeking hormonal contraceptives. Progestin-only methods including the progestin-only pill (POP), levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD, etonorgestrel implant or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) have the potential to negatively affect mood symptoms for women with or without baseline mood disorders, including PMDD. Careful counseling and close follow-up is recommended for patients with PMDD seeking these contraceptive methods.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "title": "Sexual side effects of drugs.",
      "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease.",

      "title": "Determinants of depressive symptom trajectories among older adults in community and treatment settings",
      "abstract": "Sub-diagnostic depression, sleep, and circadian rest-activity rhythm (CAR) syndromes are common in late-life, but their characteristics, prevalence, and relations to future depression are unclear. We characterized commonly occurring sleep, CAR, and depressive sign/symptom patterns using a data-driven approach applied to a large population-based study of older men. We next examined relationships of these baseline syndromes with longitudinal change in depressive symptoms. Common (32.44%) probable depressive syndromes were characterized by somatic/apathy symptoms; a subset (5.74%) with only limited somatic/apathy symptoms also had emotional-related impairment. Subjective complaints without objectively (actigraph) assessed disturbances characterized two distinct classes of men (totaling 37.46%); a pattern of objective disturbance (including greater sleep fragmentation with probable prolonged sleep latency or short (<5 hour) sleep duration) occurred in both the presence (8.87%) and absence (8.51%) of subjective complaints. Only 32.18% appeared to be free of a non-normative CAR parameter; 8 classes were distinguished by activity timing, levels, and the active period length. Baseline sleep and depression latent classes were not meaningfully associated with rates of change in depression severity. The rate of increase in depressive symptoms was higher for classes with later activity and for a class with dampened, earlier, and compressed activity combined. Future work should assess the modifiability of the identified markers of depressive symptom increases through preventative interventions. Nevertheless, there remains a need to understand of mechanisms of variability in pharmacological treatment response among older adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). We therefore assessed prognostic factors associated with distinct trajectories of depressive symptom change over 12-weeks of open-label Venlafaxine XR treatment for MDD. Only about 42% of participants exhibited a clear response, and the clinical prognostic factors linked to unique patterns of non-response included: worse depressive severity, longer illness duration, prior adequate pharmacological treatment, and worse list recognition performance. Overall, this work has public health relevance by providing a novel description of common sleep-wake/depressive syndromes in the community and distinct symptom trajectories found when pharmacologically treating MDD in the clinic. There is a need to integrate the identified prognostic markers with neurobiological research towards a valid predictive science of depression pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biologically, an MS relapse (flare, exacerbation, attack) is defined as a clinical worsening due to a new or expanding area of CNS inflammation. Clinically, the change in neurologic symptoms and signs should persist for more than 48 hours. Only two conditions have been persuasively linked to an increased risk of relapses. These are the period 2 to 6 months postpartum, when a woman’s immune system readjusts to normal,1–4 and the period 1 to 5 weeks following an infection, usually a viral infection.5,6 The reason for the latter phenomenon is not known but is believed to result from a stimulation of the immune system following its response to the infectious agent. Making the diagnosis of an MS relapse can be difficult. Many factors can contribute to a worsening of symptoms and signs in persons with MS that are not the result of new CNS inflammation. Worsening of signs and symptoms resulting from non–MS-related disease processes is called a “pseudorelapse” or “pseudo-exacerbation.” These phenomena should always be considered before diagnosing a true MS attack. Some of the most common and important non-MS causes of increased symptoms and signs are noted in Table 7.1.",

Evidence on sexual functioning in patients of psychosis is limited and needs further understanding. Studies show about 60%–70% women of the schizophrenia spectrum and illness to experience sexual difficulties. Based on available information, sexual dysfunction in population with psychosis can be attributed to a variety of psychosocial factors, ranging from the psychotic symptoms in itself to social stigma and institutionalization and also due to the antipsychotic treatment. Despite the decline in sexual activity and quality of life in general, it is very rarely addressed by both the treating doctor and by the patient themselves hence creating a lacuna in the patient’s care and availability of information regarding the illness’ pathophysiology. Patients become noncompliant with medications due to this undesirable effect and hence it requires to be given more attention during treatment. It was also found that paranoid type of schizophrenia patient had lower chances of separation than patients with other types of schizophrenia. The risk of relapse in cases with later age of onset of the disease, lower education, a positive family history of psychosis or a lower income increased more than other populations.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

Compared to the hysterical structure, schizoids more frequently show the following characteristics: they are men and have as their secondary component a mixed character structure, an earlier age of onset, a longer duration of illness but earlier referral for psychotherapy. They suffer mainly from psychic symptoms--depressive states and contact difficulties as the indicating signs. Further complaints are defective concentration, feelings of apprehension and difficulty in working, also bulimia and the inability to breathe deeply. They were mostly born between 1940 and 1959. Their relatives suffered from psychiatric disorders. Compared to the schizoids, hysterically structured individuals are almost exclusively women, their second most important structural component being obsessive-compulsive. They develop their illness later, have it for a shorter time and are referred for psychotherapy later. Their indicating signs manifest themselves more often somatically, less frequently as anxiety states or phobias. The symptoms occur simultaneously in several organ systems, particularly the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and the musculoskeletal system. Common symptoms are dyspnea and/or hyperventilation tetany, nausea, weight gain, frigidity and fluor as well as crying fits. They formerly suffered from gynecological disorders and had to undergo operations. They were mainly born between 1920 and 1939. Their relatives had cardiac disorders and their symptoms were identical or similar to those of their father.",

No major changes in the neurological status of these children were observed. However, the three children with ADHD showed an exacerbation of symptoms on fluoxetine. Discontinuation (n = 5) or halving the dosage (n = 7) resulted in complete resolution of these unwanted symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks. In all 7 children whose doses were reduced, improvement of the depressive or obsessive compulsive symptoms was maintained on the lower dosage. Clinicians treating children with fluoxetine are cautioned to be aware of behavioral side effects which may be alleviated by dosage reduction or possibly by starting with lower doses. These side effects may be difficult to differentiate from common psychopathological symptoms such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity.",

Among patients with definite major depression followed every 3 months to remission and thereafter, residual symptoms reaching 8 or more on the Hamilton Depression Scale 17-item total were present in 32% (19) of the 60 who remitted below major depression by 15 months. The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

Routine screening for sexual dysfunction is recommended. Infertility mental health professionals are well-suited to screen for sexual dysfunction, and therapeutic interventions for the management of sexual dysfunction exist.

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a noncyclical pain that has duration of at least 6 months and can lead to decreased quality of life and physical performance. The pain can be attributed to problems in the pelvic organs and/or problems in related systems, and possible psycho‐social attributes may contribute to the manifestation. Due to the complex nature, CPP syndromes are multifactorial and the terminology needs to reflect the setting. Methods The current review is a synthesis of key aspects of the recent International Continence Society Standardization for Terminology in CPP Syndromes. Results Nine domains can be used for a detailed description of CPP. They include four domains specific to the pelvic organs (lower urinary tract, female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal), two related to other sources of pain which may be perceived in the pelvis (musculoskeletal, neurological) and three which may influence the response to the pain or its impact on the individual (psychological, sexual, and comorbidities). For an individual patient with CPP, each domain should be reviewed in terms of symptoms and signs, noting that positive findings could reflect either a primary cause or a secondary consequence. The findings will guide further evaluations and subsequent treatment. Conclusion We present a synthesis of the standard for terminology in CPP syndromes in women and men, which serves as a systematic framework to consider possible sources of pain (pelvic organs or other sources) and the individual responses and impact.",

It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder. The decrease in attention, memory or disturbances in executive functioning are also symptoms called cognitives, which can get to add to the traditional division of existing symptoms.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction can have a significant effect on quality of life, but is not reported or underdiagnosed. A review of the recent literature highlights the correlation between sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life in people with psychiatric comorbidities and explores several aspects that influence care, from patient follow-up to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Sexual dysfunction (DS) has been shown to be predominant, but underdiagnosed and often untreated due to communication barriers between patients and physicians. The pharmacogenic and morphogenic causes of sexual problems are often difficult to differentiate. Psychiatric illness may increase the risk of DS, and DS may further aggravate psychiatric problems, suggesting a two-way relationship. Their effective treatment often involves a combination of elements of psychotherapy and behavioral therapies with pharmacotherapeutic interventions, if necessary. The persistence of sexual problems has a significant negative impact on patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment, but also on the patient's quality of life. Routine assessment of sexual function needs to be integrated into ongoing care to identify and address early problems. If sexual dysfunction is ignored, the psychiatric disorder can be maintained, the outcome of treatment can be compromised, and it can lead to non-compliance with treatment schedules.",

      "abstract": "Any type of sexual dysfunction is an important problem in half of the patients with depressive disorder. On the other hand, one to a quarter of people without any depressive disorder experience sexual dysfunction. Antidepressant agents can lead to all types of sexual side effects including arousal, libido, orgasm and ejaculation problems. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used class of drugs which are prescribed for the treatment of a variety of disorders, including major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and impulse control disorders. It has been reported that one in eight people have utilized one of the SSRIs in the past 10 years. Some studies reported up to 80% of SSRI-induced sexual side effects. Management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction seems to be complex and hard. In this paper, SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction and new perspectives in the management of this problem were reviewed.",

      "title": "Vascular depression – regarding a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Age-related vascular changes have long been documented as an etiopathogenic factor of some geriatric depressive syndromes. More recently, it has emerged the concept of “Vascular Depression” recognizing that cardiovascular disease may predispose, precipitate or perpetuate late life depression. This condition was defined by an episode of major depressive disorder within the preceding 12 months in elderly with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, or major cardiovascular risk factors. Vascular Depression isn`t described in DSM-V, and that difficults clinical recognition and affects clinically informed systematic studies. Objectives Regarding a clinical case, we enphasize the clinical impact of Vascular Depression`s hypothesis. Methods We present a qualitative review of this topic using the Pubmed Central database. Results 74 years old male patient, with major depressive disorder about ten years. Depressive and cognitive symptoms didn`t respond to antidepressive treatment and his functional state has gradually declined. Conclusions Vascular depression develops after the 60 – 65 years in the absence of personal and family history of affective disorder. The key symptoms are low energy, anhedonia, deficits in selfinitiation, psychomotor retardation, reduced processing speed and lack of insight into mood symptoms. Clinical assessment includes a review of history of vascular risk factors or/and disease, but also an imagiological evidence demonstrating subcortical white matter abnormalities. Insidious and chronic course tends to delay its recognition and management. This becomes critical because Vascular Depression is associated with poor response to antidepressant treatment and persistent depressive symptoms. It`s also associated with poor selfmanagement of comorbidities and impairment in daily function. Increased mortality from all causes is widely documented.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies confirm a significantly (several times, in fact) increased risk for schizophrenics to commit severely violent acts compared to the general population. Violent acts of minor degree and threats not followed by forensic detention are even much more common. Data on prevalence depend on study conditions, sample selection, and outcome definitions of violence. In psychiatric hospitals, too, violent and threatening behaviour seems to occur most frequently in schizophrenic patients. However, in this respect findings are inconsistent and display considerable variations across different countries and times (with increasing rates reported within the last decade). Additional risk indicators beside the diagnosis of schizophrenia are male gender, comorbidity with personality disorders, substance abuse, lack of adequate treatment and increasing social disintegration due to an unfavourable course of the illness. The violence risk does not seem to decrease with increasing age in contrast to the general population. Beyond these sociodemographic data and variables related to treatment and course of illness, psychopathological causes of violence are less evident. Even imperative hallucinations are not clearly associated with violence; systematic delusions are associated with severe violent acts, but not with the much more frequent violent acts of minor degree. Most probably, the total of psychopathological symptomatology is associated with the proneness to aggressive behaviour. Neuropsychological and biological findings are also inconsistent.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

The results were: five cases (3.5%) with primary affective disorder (2 with circular type, 1 with depressed type and 2 with involutional melancholia), nine with atypical chronic depression (4 with depressive neurosis and 5 with depressive paranoid reaction), one with successful suicide and three with prominent self-destructive behavior on excessive drinking. The incidence of primary affective disorder in alcoholism approximates to 2 to 4 percent in Japan, and is a little lower than that of U.S.A or of Europe. A characteristic of the clinic for alcoholism was the frequent presentation of atypical or chronic depression. This was usually diagnosed as depressive neurosis or depressive personality disorder, and some developed to a transient paranoid state with excessive drinking. The rate of suicide in alcoholism seems to be lower in Japan than in Western countries: approximately a few percent in a few years in this country and 7 to 8 percent in Western countries. Those cases with prominent self-destructive behavior were young alcoholics. They had underlying personality disorders and complicated life histories.",

Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression.

Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite.

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome—Psychiatric or Gynaecological Disorder?",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

      "title": "Erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients in contrast to other premature ejaculation syndromes",
      "abstract": "Time (of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency, or IELT); control (of the ejaculation); distress (perceived by the patient and the partner): These are the dimensions well recognized as being intrinsically connected, and affected, in premature ejaculation (PE) patients.1 However, it is unanimously accepted that PE is a tri- or multidimensional disorder (considering the impairment of the orgasm2), meaning that other relevant psychosexological correlates characterize the condition and contribute to its pathophysiology and clinical presentation. This finding significantly emerges also from the recent and interesting paper \"erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress and Insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients compared to other premature ejaculation syndromes\" by Demirci et al. In particular, erectile dysfunction (ED) severity was found to be high in patients with acquired PE (APE) (80.0%) and moderate in lifelong PE (LPE) (38.5%), while the greatest number of patients with no ED were found in the type subgroup previously (although not consistently) defined in the past as \"subjective\" PE (SPE in the article, a now misleading acronym, being used for the well-structured taxonomic category of subclinical premature ejaculation, having major and minor diagnostic criteria: SPE3) (75.0%). However, looking at the other side of the coin, 11 of 18 of such SPE patients (thus more than 50%) were found to have moderate or severe ED too. If, on the one hand, it is bizarre to notice that such patients who thought they have ejaculated early despite a normal time (hence labelled as subjective PE) and, for this reason, in contrast to \"true\" PE patients (i.e., LPE and APE) end up having ED too, on the other hand (and looking from a more realistic perspective) such data are not surprising at all. Indeed, in clinical practice, 50% of patients with PE also report ED, and the correlation between erectile and ejaculatory function is so well-known that recently a new taxonomic entity called \"loss of control of erection and ejaculation\" has been proposed,3 to identify the condition of impaired ability to control at the same time erectile and ejaculatory function which so frequently occurs among patients,4 and so frequently it is neither diagnosed nor treated. In fact, the decision not to treat a patient that complains about PE because he thinks to have ejaculated early despite a normal time, can forecast potential risks in clinical management. Indeed, often such patients, despite showing a subnormal IELT, may still face a relevant lack of control in the ejaculation process (and significant perceived distress). ED can often be superimposed on these patients, who instinctively reduce their level of excitement in an attempt to control their ejaculation. Thereby, considering them as having a subjective disorder, simply reassuring rather than treating them, may worsen the situation, harbouring, bona fide, the risk of converting a situation of subclinical PE into an overt PE. Among the patients analyzed by Demirci et al., only four of 18 of subjective PE reported good or very good ejaculatory control. Moreover, the median value of their premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), is 11, which yet accounts for a PE diagnosis. Indeed, PEDT, the most important psychometric test aiding the diagnosis of PE, has precisely two items dealing with control, two for distress, and one only for time. Interestingly, the Patient Reported Outcomes of this diagnostic tool are now validated for the autoerotic setting, enlarging the diagnostic possibilities of PE diagnosis to single people.5 More emphasis is given to the lack of control and distress, rather than the IELT, for defining what PE is. This has been similarly stated by the latest guidelines of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine, which recommended considering the aspects of the tri-dimensional definition of PE in order of clinical importance.6 Hierarchically, loss of control over ejaculation is clinically more relevant than the distress provoked in the patient or the partner, and even more than short IELT.7 We found another interesting finding in the Demirci et al.'s article. The Colleagues nicely found, by well-validated psychometric tools, that PE symptoms are associated with worse sleep quality and erectile function. Future research should concentrate on the levels of testosterone, robustly related to nocturnal apneas and ED, also in PE, which presents significantly higher levels of T with respect to other sexual dysfunctions such as ED.8 Altogether, this article reminds us once more that time is only one of the main criteria for establishing a diagnosis of PE and that the clinical spectrum of PE is quite more complex. We thereby encourage, when dealing with PE patients both in the research and in the clinical practice, to consider the sexual and non-sexual comorbidities,9 as well all the lights and shades of the current definitions and to realistically appraise the whole clinical spectrum of PE patients, very far from being only a matter of (short) time.10",

Being bedfast with poor caretaker relationships and being socially isolated are risk factors for psychosis among elderly persons. A thorough history is essential to differential diagnosis. Psychiatric causes to be ruled out include schizophrenia; depression, including mania; dementia and delirium; paranoid state; and late-life delusional disorder. Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered. If symptoms are not alleviated when psychosocial triggers or underlying toxic, organic, or medical causes are addressed, patients may respond to supportive therapy and low doses of high-potency neuroleptics. The clinician should keep in mind that older adults are highly sensitive to the side effects of these agents.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

This behavior is often, but not exclusively, a way for individuals to manage intense emotions, relieve emotional or psychological pain, or punish themselves. Self-mutilation can be observed in various psychiatric contexts, including personality disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders. This psychiatric manifestation, which transcends diagnostic categories, can involve various types of self-harm to different parts of the body, including the genitals, known as Klingsor Syndrome. Inspired by a fictional character from Wagner’s opera, Klingsor Syndrome is a term used to describe extreme cases of self-destructive behavior where an individual, often in a psychotic state, inflicts severe injuries on their genital organs. This syndrome is often associated with psychosensory or intrapsychic hallucinations and delusional ideas occurring within the context of acute or chronic psychotic disorders. Treatment is multidisciplinary, involving surgical repair and rigorous psychiatric follow-up. In this paper, we report the case of genital self-mutilation occurring in a psychotic patient.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

Objectives To report and discuss a clinical case, followed by the authors. Aims/Methods Consultation of the patient's medical file, serial clinical evaluations and scientific literature review. Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy. Some of the difficulties outlined by the patient are: on his way to and from work, whenever he passed by a crosswalk he would circle the following roundabout several times, to confirm that he hadn't run over any pedestrian; at the end of the day, he would go through the same path in reverse, by bicycle, to confirm that no pedestrians had been run over by him. After two years of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions On this case, the most likely diagnosis is an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The particularity of this case lays on its severity, given its evolution period, the psychopathological richness demonstrated and the functional commitment of the patient; and in the significant clinical improvements observed, largely due to optimal patient adherence to treatment.",

A number of endogenous substances regulate libido, which include cortisol, serotonin, oestrogens, dopamine, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, norepinephrine, oxytocin, progesterone, and sex-hormone-binding globulins. Psychological factors can impact on libido, namely, interpersonal relationship, loss of intimacy, stress, fatigue, and bereavement. Other causes include experience of sexual abuse, assault, trauma or neglect, negative body image, and anxiety about engaging in sexual activity. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, reduce sex drive both through biochemical imbalances and the side effects of medications. In cases of low libido, it is important for the woman to describe the problem, including when it first started and how it has developed.",

      "title": "Psychosocial and socioeconomic burden of vasomotor symptoms in menopause: A comprehensive review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many women experience vasomotor symptoms at or around the time of menopause. Hot flushes and night sweats are considered primary menopausal symptoms that may also be associated with sleep and mood disturbances, as well as decreased cognitive function. All of these symptoms may lead to social impairment and work-related difficulties that significantly decrease overall quality of life. Hot flushes have shown a great deal of variability in their frequency and severity in women. In some women, hot flushes persist for several months; in others, they may last for more than 10 years. Traditionally vasomotor symptoms were reported to begin 5 to 10 years prior to the cessation of the final menstrual cycle, corresponding with the initial decline in circulating gonadal hormones; however, night sweats in particular most often begin in perimenopause. The pathogenesis of hot flushes has not yet been fully elucidated, but the circuitry involving estrogen and neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin specifically, are hypothesized to play a major role in the altered homeostatic thermoregulatory mechanisms underlying these events. Menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms are associated with significant direct and indirect costs. Overall costs of traditional pharmacotherapy or complementary and alternative medicine modalities, including over-the-counter treatments and dietary supplements, for managing menopause-related vasomotor symptoms are substantial and include initial and follow-up physician visits and telephone calls. Additional costs include laboratory testing, management of adverse events, loss of productivity at work, and personal and miscellaneous costs. Pharmacoeconomic analyses, including those that consider risks identified by the Women's Health Initiative, generally support the cost-effectiveness of hormonal therapy for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms, which have been the mainstay for the management of these symptoms for more than 50 years. However, because many women now want to avoid hormone therapy, there is a need for additional targeted therapies, validated by results from controlled clinical trials that are safe, efficacious, cost-effective, and well tolerated by symptomatic menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and affects approximately1% of\r\nthe population. EOS begins before the age of eighteen, while VEOS begins before the age of\r\nthirteen. Since etiopathogenesis remains unclear, there are various theories about the emergence\r\nof schizophrenia: the dopamine theory, the genetic theory, the psychodynamic theory, the\r\nenvironmental theory and other. Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Antipsychotics are the\r\nfirst-line therapy, and the atipycal antipsychotics are the first choice. Typical (classical) and\r\natypical (newer) antipsychotics are used in therapy. It is necessary to include psychotherapy,\r\nparticularly cognitive therapy and psychoeducation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive substances are believed to be aphrodisiac; but in reality they have deleterious effects on all the aspects of sexual function. The purpose of this article is to review and summarize the available scientific literature on the impact of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs on erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Almost all of them have been reported to be associated with ED. These substances may exert their inhibitory effect on erection through their effects on central neurotransmitter pathways (serotogenic, adrenergic or dopaminergic). Besides, some also may exhibit vasoconstricting properties (cocaine), impair endothelium function (nicotine) or suppress the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary, resulting in hypogonadism (morphine) to induce ED. The relationship between ED and psychoactive substances is attributed not only to pharmacological effects, but also to psychological and social reactions to substance dependence. Whether withdrawal from the substances could restore erectile function remains unknown. However, human and animal studies demonstrated that the effects of neurological damage from chronic substance abuse are long-lasting. This information of sexual consequence of the substances will be of great general interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered as a great human value related to happiness and satisfaction, but unfortunately, when affecting mental disorders, they tend to be associated with second level human functions. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction often accompanies psychiatric disorder, intensely influencing compliance, quality of life and human relationships. Sexuality could be influenced either by a mental disorder itself, difficulties to get and maintain couple relationships or by the use of psychotropic treatments. Treatment-related adverse events are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians, scarcely spontaneously communicated by patients, and rarely investigated in clinical trials. The most frequent psychotropic compounds that could deteriorate sexuality and quality of life include antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood regulators. There are important differences between them related to some variations in mechanisms of action including serotonin, dopamine and prolactin levels. Little is known about the relevance of sexuality and its dysfunctions in chronic and frequent mental and neurological disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, alcohol or drug dependencies, epilepsy and childhood pathology. Poor sexual life, low satisfaction and more frequent risky sex behavior than in the general population are associated with severe mental diseases. There is a need for increasing research in this field, including epidemiological, psychological, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic variables related to sexual life to get a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. To increase the sensibility of clinicians, the identification and management of sexual disturbances after the onset of any mental disorder should be highlighted. This would avoid unnecessary suffering and deterioration of quality of life.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

The 2nd group is schizophrenic cases shifted from so-called borderline cases. The 3rd group is the cases of paranoid reaction. The 4th group is borderline cases in adolescence. The last 5th group is the cases unable to be classified into any groups above mentioned, and shows most characteristic symptoms.The distinguishing traits of 5th group were as follows. They developed symptoms in middle ages after being affected psychologically or physically. The persistent abnormal cenesthesia full of agony was rather tinged with hallucination, and it was some experience of moving, tense or pulling sensations, or of utterly new strange foreign sensations. Despite the peculiar strange complaints, they did not make pathological interpretations and their insight into their morbid states was preserved to some extent. But, pathological obsessive attitudes (such as skin-rubbing) and temporary abulic states often appeared, so that in their course they wore temporarily psychotic feature. Despite the chronic course, schizophrenic tendency did not appear.The author discussed the psychopathology of cenesthopathy and concluded that the 5th group should be diagnosed as typical cenesthopathia.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a collection of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms causing clinically significant distress or interference that occur in the 7 days prior to the onset of menses, after which they become minimal or absent. The diagnosis is established by symptom documentation using a validated, reliable tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for at least 2 menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of relevant symptoms. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there is a 1.8%-5.8% 12-month prevalence of PMDD among menstruating women1; however, the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing clinically significant interference or distress but not meeting full criteria for a diagnosis of PMDD may be as high as 13%-18%.",

      "abstract": "Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a form of mental illness that causes one or more distressing somatic symptoms leading to a significant disruption to everyday life, characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. While SSD is characterized by significant discomfort in some parts of the body, these symptoms are not related to any known medical condition and therefore it cannot be diagnosed using any medical instrument examination. Currently available treatments for SSD, including drug therapy and psychotherapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy), usually improve psychiatric symptoms, but the results are often disappointing. Furthermore, SSD is often comorbid with anxiety and depression (75.1 and 65.7%, respectively). Importantly, interventions targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC; e.g., deep brain stimulation and thermal ablation) can effectively treat various mental disorders, such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and eating disorders, suggesting that it may also be effective for treating the depressive symptoms associated with SSD comorbidity. In this report, a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with SSD accompanied with depression and anxiety underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy. The patient complained of nausea and vomiting, swelling of the hilum of the liver for 14 years, weakness of the limbs for 13 years, and burning pain in the esophagus for 1 year. Psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments were conducted to record the severity of the patients' symptoms and the progression of postoperative symptoms. The patient's somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms as well as quality of life improved significantly and steadily; thus, anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication were stopped. However, the patient developed new somatization symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and sternal pain, 10 months after the operation. Therefore, the patient resumed taking flupentixol and melitracen in order to control the new symptoms. This study shows that bilateral anterior capsulotomy appears to be a complementary treatment for refractory SSD with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, postoperative use of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications may be useful for controlling future somatization symptoms.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

      "abstract": "Results of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) are frequently abnormal in depression but not always. We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

      "abstract": "For almost all types of accidents and violence, there is a causal relationship with alcohol intoxication or alcohol abuse. Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews. There is often a lack of relevant control data.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Misregulation occurs because of false assumptions or misdirected efforts, especially an unwarranted emphasis on emotion.

Loss of control of attention, failure of transcendence, and various lapse-activated causes all contribute to regulatory failure.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla (EM) é uma doença autoimune neurodegenerativa que afeta o sistema nervoso central (SNC), mais especificamente na bainha de mielina. Isto ocorre pela inflamação da membrana envoltória do axônio por uma agressão das células “T” autoreativas, com a perda da mielina, a neurotransmissão fica prejudicada, impedindo a condução dos impulsos nervosos. Cerca de 75% dos pacientes afetados apresentamem alguma fase da doença a fadiga, impossibilitando a realização de suas atividades de vida diária (AVDs) pela presença de dor e/ou fraqueza muscular. A fadiga experimentada pelos pacientes com EM é diferente da que acomete indivíduos saudáveis, ou outrasdoenças e, exerce claramente um grande fardo físico e psicológico podendo ter um impacto importante na qualidade de vida. O presente projeto teve o objetivo em uma fase inicial o desenvolvimento de habilidades e competências dos integrantes sobre a doençae traçar um perfil dos pacientes com esclerose múltipla que serão atendidos em uma fase crônica de intervenção, assim como o envio ao comitê de ética e saúde da secretaria de saúde do Distrito Federal. O projeto foi realizado em parceria com o Hospital deBase de Brasília. A fase crônica do projeto prevê uma intervenção que será realizada com musicoterapia, exercícios fisioterapêuticos e exercício físico (treino de força), objetivando o tratamento e a determinação de protocolos para a referida população. Operíodo da intervenção será de doze semanas com duas sessões semanais. O perfil e as coletas traçadas na fase inicial demonstraram que as avaliações tendem a apresentar moderadas e fortes correlações das variáveis de equilíbrio, força muscular e capacidade funcional com os valores de EDSS (Escala Expandida do Estado de Incapacidade de Kurtzke). A referida escala é um método de quantificar incapacidades ocorridas durante a evolução da Esclerose Múltipla ao longo do tempo. Algumas limitações do estudo como número da amostra pequeno (n=5) e a não realização de uma avaliação crônica impediu a conclusão de causa e efeito das variáveis. Como desfecho as avaliações realizadas demonstraram ser adequadas e com respostas as hipóteses criadas. Após o período de intervenção possivelmente será demonstrado resultados que nortearão mais uma alternativa no tratamento de pacientes com Esclerose Múltipla",

Individuals with CD are generally considered to be deceitful, hostile, and destructive. The symptoms categories associated with CD include (a) physical harm to people or animals, (b) destruction of property, (c) deceitfulness and theft, and (c) breaking societal norms. The severity of CD can be determined based upon the individual’s lack of empathy; greater lack of empathy across a variety of settings indicates more severe CD. In order to diagnose a child or adolescent with CD, the enduring and repetitive symptoms of CD must cause significant impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning, occur more than once per week, and be present for at least three months (APA).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

To make the diagnosis there must be abnormalities in either or both attention and activity which are excessive compared with the norm for a child of that age or developmental level, have been present from an early age (at least seven years but often identifiable by three years) and are pervasive, ie present in more than one area of a child's life (home, school, social situations etc). Medically the status of this diagnos is is that of a syndrome or disorder, not a disease, and none of the described behaviours is exclusive to the diagnosis. It also presents as a spectrum disorder, with less and more severe degrees, but it should be noted that the DSM IV classification requires evidence of clinically significant impairment of function.

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "Empirical results from epidemiological studies on pain-depression comorbidity in primary care and population samples have shown that: (a) pain is as strongly associated with anxiety as with depressive disorders; (b) characteristics that most strongly predict depression are diffuseness of pain and the extent to which pain interferes with activities; (c) certain psychological symptoms (low energy, disturbed sleep, worry) are prominent among pain patients, while others (guilt, loneliness) are not; (d) depression and pain dysfunction are evident early in the natural history of pain, but dysfunction and distress are often transient; and (e) among initially dysfunctional pain patients whose dysfunction is chronic, depression levels do not improve but neither do they increase over time with chronicity alone. These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently prescribed (1) and are better tolerated than older antidepressants, side effects such as sexual dysfunction limit patient acceptance of these medications. DSM-IV-TR categorizes medication-induced sexual dysfunction as a type of substance-induced sexual dysfunction. (2) These dysfunctions are characterized by impairment of various sexual response phases (Table 1). (2), (3) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Table 1 Sexual dysfunction and the sexual response cycle Phase Description Dysfunction/disorder Desire Characterized by sexual Hypoactive sexual desire fantasies and the desire to disorder have sex Sexual aversion disorder Hypoactive sexual desire disorder due to a general medical condition Substance-induced sexual dysfunction with impaired desire Excitement Subjective sense of sexual Female sexual arousal pleasure and accompanying disorder physiologic changes Erectile disorder Erectile disorder due to a general medical condition Dyspareunia due to a general medical condition Substance-induced sexual dysfunction with impaired arousal Orgasm Peaking of sexual pleasure Female orgasmic disorder with release of sexual tension Male orgasmic disorder Premature ejaculation Other sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition Substance-induced sexual dysfunction with impaired orgasm Resolution A sense of general Postcoital dysphoria relaxation, well-being, and muscle relaxation Postcoital headache Source: References 2, 3 Estimating the true incidence and prevalence of SSRI-related sexual dysfunction can be difficult. Zimmerman et al (4) compared psychiatrists' clinical assessments of depressed patients receiving ongoing treatment with results of a standardized side effects questionnaire and found that even though psychiatrists regularly inquired about sexual side effects, on the questionnaire patients reported higher rates of almost all sexual dysfunctions. The incidence of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction also can be difficult to ascertain because some sexual dysfunctions frequently accompany a primary psychiatric disorder (5) or physical illness. Balon (6) suggested that the incidence of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction is 30% to 50%, although others have reported higher incidences. Few quality studies have focused on identifying the exact nature and causes of SSRI treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction. This article describes mechanisms that may be fundamental to SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Not just serotonin Although SSRIs are relatively selective for the serotonergic system, they affect other neurotransmitter systems as well (Table 2, page 32) (7) For example, at high dosages paroxetine is believed to block norepinephrine reuptake, and it has a clinically significant anticholinergic effect. …",

Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs. Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines.

      "abstract": "This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a disorder with a high prevalence that increases with age. It is estimated that 18.9% of men’s between 25 and 70 years suffer it in Spain. Most cases have a multifactorial origin and it is admitted the influence on its pathogenesis of systemic diseases, different kind of drugs, psychogenic factors, cardiovascular, endocrinological and neurological diseases. Neurologic cause erectile dysfunction may have its origin in the central or peripheral nervous system. Among possible process of neurogenic erectile dysfunction of central origin would be tumors, cerebral vascular accidents, encephalitis, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis and other demyelinization diseases, dementias, olivopontocerebellar degeneration and epilepsy. Myelopathies of any etiology may be, depending on their localization and extension, cause of erectile dysfunction. At the peripheral level, disorders of the sensitive tracts constituting the afferent limb of the erection spinal reflex, and the efferent vegetative or somatic tracts mediating arterial vasodilatation, cavernous smooth muscle relaxation or pelvic floor striated muscle contraction. The aim of this work is to review in detail the most relevant causes of neurogenic erectile dysfunction, their etiopathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches currently considered more adequate for each particular case.CONCLUSIONS: The correct diagnostic approach to patients with erectile dysfunction passes through identification, if possible, of the etiopathogenic factors implied. Regarding this, detection and identification of a possible neurogenic risk factor will contribute to a better understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms, and more adequate diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches, mainly in those patients refractory to first line therapy.",

Opinion is expressed that hypersexuality can be both normal and pathological, and each of the models of submitted pathological hypersexuality is useful in certain cases, since it describes the condition of a particular patient better than other models.

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "title": "Is Favorable Outcome Possible After Prolonged Refractory Status Epilepticus?",
      "abstract": "Summary: When status epilepticus (SE) remains refractory to appropriate therapy, it is associated with high mortality and with substantial morbidity in survivors. Many outcome predictors such as age, seizure type, level of consciousness before treatment, and mostly, etiology, are well-established. A longer duration of SE is often associated with worse outcome, but duration may lose its prognostic value after several hours. Several terms and definitions have been used to describe prolonged, refractory SE, including “malignant SE,” “prolonged” SE, and more recently, “super refractory” SE, defined as “SE that has continued or recurred despite 24 hours of general anesthesia (or coma-inducing anticonvulsants).” There are few data available regarding the outcome of prolonged refractory SE, and even fewer for SE remaining refractory to anesthetic drugs. This article reviews reports of outcome after prolonged, refractory, and “super refractory” SE. Most information detailing the clinical outcome of patients surviving these severe illnesses, in which seizures can persist for days or weeks (and especially those concerning “super-refractory” SE) come from case reports and retrospective cohort studies. In many series, prolonged, refractory SE has a mortality of 30% to 50%, and several studies indicate that most survivors have a substantial decline in functional status. Nevertheless, several reports demonstrate that good functional outcome is possible even after several days of SE and coma induction. Treatment of refractory SE should not be withdrawn from younger patients without structural brain damage at presentation solely because of the duration of SE.",

The author was interested in discovering whether the frequency and topology of lesions in the brain of patients with presenile dementia and motor neuron disease differed characteristically from the distribution found in cases of Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or progressive subcortical gliosis.

The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death.

Anabolic-androgenic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics are the most frequently implicated drugs in hyperandrogenism. The mechanisms of androgen excess are various: (1) intrinsic androgenic activity of the drug, (2) interaction with sex hormone-binding globulin, or (3) functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis. Nevertheless, the physiology of these drugs remains generally unclear. Such is the case for valproate, which seems to induce a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by increasing ovarian androgen synthesis. It should be remembered that it is always necessary to rule out other causes of androgen excess, especially an ovarian or adrenal tumor or PCOS, before attributing the symptom(s) to a drug.",

      "title": "SP0046 What we need to consider in physician-patient communication on sexual problems in different rheumatic conditions",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Quality of life (QOL) is often reduced in patients with chronic diseases. Sexual activity and enjoyment constitute an important aspect of QOL. Sexuality is a neglected area of QOL in patients with rheumatic disease. Sexual problems among patients are common and often increase with disease duration. Both disease related factors and the psychological response to chronic disease can impair sexual functioning. General disease symptoms like pain, fatigue, disease activity, and impaired physical function contribute to reduced sexual activity in both genders. However, psychological factors like depression, anxiety, negative body image and low self-esteem play an important role. Sexual dysfunction can create frustration and distress, and if chronic increase anxiety and depression, and damage interpersonal relationships. Sexual health is rarely addressed by health professionals (HP), and it is as a rule not spontaneously reported by patients. HPs may feel awkward to intrude into the intimate sphere of a patient, and patients may feel ashamed of revealing their sexual dysfunction. A first step to improve the physician-patient communication in this area is to include sexuality in the curriculum of health professionals teaching how to address and evaluate sexual function. Assessment of sexual function by validated instruments includes both frequency of intercourse as well as sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. In women vaginal lubrication and in men erectile function and ejaculation are part of the evaluation. Assessment of disease activity and comorbidities helps to detect physical components of sexual dysfunction. Barriers regarding communication on sexual activity should be identified and overcome. Assessment of sexual function may be assigned to a specially trained nurse, an occupational therapist or a psychologist of the interdisciplinary team. Referral to specialists in urology, gynaecology or sexual medicine may also help patients to get a better sex life. A major point for restoring sexual and reproductive health in patients of both genders is to achieve optimal disease control. <h3>Reference</h3> [1] Østensen M.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by exposure to a traumatic event followed by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, peritraumatic dissociation, and impairment in functioning. ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of large-scale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.",

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "abstract": "La depresión mayor con síntomas psicóticos constituye una forma grave de trastorno afectivo que puede adoptar presentaciones clínicas atípicas en personas mayores. Se presenta el caso de una mujer de 86 años que ingresa en el servicio de geriatría por rechazo absoluto a la ingesta de alimentos y líquidos, acompañado de verbalizaciones religiosas y nihilistas. La paciente manifestaba creencias como “ya estoy con Dios” y “no necesito comer porque ya estoy muerta”, sin mostrar signos de agitación ni alucinaciones activas. En la valoración psiquiátrica se identificó un episodio depresivo mayor con síntomas psicóticos congruentes con el estado de ánimo (CIE-10 F32.3), con delirio nihilista compatible con el síndrome de Cotard. Se inició tratamiento con mirtazapina y haloperidol intravenoso, observándose progresiva remisión del delirio y mejora funcional. Este caso pone de relieve la importancia de reconocer manifestaciones poco comunes de la depresión psicótica en población anciana, así como la utilidad de antidepresivos con perfil geriátrico favorable combinados con antipsicóticos bien tolerados. El diagnóstico precoz y el abordaje clínico adecuado permiten revertir cuadros clínicos graves que inicialmente podrían confundirse con deterioro cognitivo irreversible. El síndrome de Cotard, aunque infrecuente, representa una expresión extrema del nihilismo en la depresión psicótica y requiere atención especializada.",

      "abstract": "Somatization disorder (SD) is a syndromatic classification that allows a physician to identify more easily patients with a lifelong history of chronic subjective physical complaints that are unverified by objective examinations either at the time of initial presentation or during the subsequent five years. The somaticizing process is believed to be an expression of emotional distress. The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "abstract": "Waham merupakan keyakinan yang salah berdasarkan interpretasi yang tidak benar dari realitas eksternal meskipun ada bukti sebaliknya. Keyakinan itu tidak sesuai dengan budaya atau subkultur seseorang, dan hampir semua orang tahu itu salah. Prevalensi gangguan waham seumur hidup adalah sekitar 0,2%. Subtipe waham presekutorik adalah yang paling umum dan subtipe somatik sangat jarang. Desain penelitian ini adalah Literature Review atau tinjauan pustaka. Penyebab gangguan waham belum diketahui secara pasti dan gangguan waham somatik cukup sulit dibedakan. Manifestasi klinis waham somatik yang paling umum adalah yang berhubungan dengan infestation (termasuk infestasi parasit); distorsi bentuk, ketiadaan, atau kerusakan bagian tubuh; nyeri dan kelemahan tubuh; atau kehilangan identitas di mana suatu bagian tubuh tampak terpisah atau asing. Pasien sangat yakin akan keparahan gejalanya.. Perlu dilakukannya pendekatan lebih pada pangobatan waham somatik, dapat diberikan antipsikotik dan SSRI. Kesan klinis menunjukkan bahwa prognosis gangguan waham buruk. Pada beberapa pasien, pengobatan dapat dikurangi atau dihentikan tanpa efek buruk, sementara pada pasien lain waham kambuh dengan cepat setelah penghentian, dan pengobatan harus dipertahankan untuk waktu yang lama.",

      "abstract": "It is only in recent years that childhood depression has received widespread attention from mental health specialists. Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

In initial screening, all possible symptoms of depression should be counted toward meeting the criteria of a depressive episode regardless of a coexistent physical disorder. Screening tests typically miss more cases in older adults with physical morbidity. The best available evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants are effective for mild-to-moderate major depressive episodes.

      "abstract": "Im Anschluss an einen zahlenmaessigen Ueberblick ueber das Vorkommen der Alzheimer-Erkrankung in den Altersgruppen ab 65 Jahren in Deutschland werden die Auswirkungen der Alzheimer-Demenz (AD) auf die Fahrtauglichkeit diskutiert. Die Beeintraechtigungen der AD werden in die Auspraegungsgrade leicht, mittel und schwer unterschieden, denen eine Praedemenzphase von etwa fuenf bis sieben Jahren mit leichten, teils schwer erfassbaren kognitiven Beeintraechtigungen vorausgeht. Die Symptome bei fortschreitender Erkrankung werden im Einzelnen beschrieben. Bei mittleren und schweren Auspraegungsgraden sind die Betroffenen nicht mehr in der Lage, ein Fahrzeug sicher zu fuehren. In der Praedemenzphase und im Fruehstadium ist es fraglich, inwieweit und wie lange die Fahrfaehigkeit ohne erhoehtes Risiko erhalten bleibt. Der individuelle Krankheitsverlauf fuehrt dazu, dass die Fahreignung unterschiedlich lange erhalten bleibt. Nicht alleine die Leistungsdefizite sind entscheidend, sondern die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation und deren Aufrechterhaltung. Im Abschnitt ueber Rechtsvorschriften und Richtlinien werden die Begutachtungs-Leitlinien zur Kraftfahrereignung zitiert. Danach ist derjenige nicht in der Lage, ein Kraftfahrzeug zu fuehren, der unter einer ausgepraegten Demenz leidet. Dabei ist der Nachweis fuer ausgepraegte Leistungsmaengel unklar, da nicht sichergestellt ist, ob und wie lange Defizite kompensiert werden koennen. Die Leistungsueberpruefungen mittels neuropsychologischer Testungen korrelieren bei aelteren Menschen nur gering mit den Ergebnissen des praktischen Fahrverhaltens.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual disinhibition is uncommon in patients with schizophrenia and are included within the behavioral disorders along with others such as agitation, aggression, sleep disorders and circadian rhythm, due to multiple reasons: isolation, rejection, difficulty in personal relationships. Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "abstract": "About 10% of women show elation and associated features of hypomania in the first 5 days following childbirth. These symptoms can be detected using a self-rating scale (the ‘Highs’) based on SADS-L criteria. This phenomenon has been confirmed using the observer-rated Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, which also revealed a high degree of related irritability. Significantly more women scoring ⩾ 8 on the Highs scale at 3 days postpartum went on to manifest depression at 6 weeks than did subjects with no psychopathology in the early puerperium. It is suggested that the ‘highs’ followed by depression may be a mild and common form of bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "A disfunção erétil (DE) é a incapacidade recorrente de obter e manter uma ereção que permita atividade sexual satisfatória, sendo a disfunção sexual que mais afeta os homens no envelhecimento. Estima-se que 50% dos homens acima de 40 anos apresentem essa disfunção. Como a prevalência é expressiva, torna-se necessária a realização de uma revisão da literatura sobre epidemiologia, fisiopatologia e tratamento acerca da DE, com o intuito de melhor compreensão da doença. A ereção é dependente de vários fatores como o relaxamento do músculo liso do corpo cavernoso, o aumento do fluxo arterial e a restrição do fluxo venoso de saída. Esses mecanismos podem estar prejudicados em várias doenças, sendo que, em alguns casos, a DE pode ser considerada como marcador precoce de problemas mais graves. Essa disfunção sexual apresenta várias etiologias: vascular, endócrina, neurológica, psicológica/psiquiátrica e relacionada às drogas ou às intervenções cirúrgicas. O próprio tratamento de algumas doenças de base pode ser a causa ou o agravamento da DE, como alguns anti-hipertensivos e antidepressivos. A principal explicação para a DE é a redução da disponibilidade de óxido nítrico, um importante vasodilatador. Contudo, fazem também parte de sua fisiopatologia a obstrução mecânica dos vasos sanguíneos e problemas de transmissão de estímulos neurológicos. A DE é primeiramente avaliada pelo método clínico, mas existem instrumentos avaliativos multidimensionais, sendo o Índice Internacional de Função Erétil considerado o padrão-ouro. O tratamento pontual para esta doença deve ser fundado na sua etiologia. Existem várias linhas de tratamento, sendo os inibidores da fosfodiesterase-5 e a psicoterapia (para DE psicogênica ou mista) os de primeira escolha, associados ou não à reposição de testosterona. Como segunda-linha, tem-se a injeção intracavernosa de substâncias vasoativas. Caso essas terapias não produzam resultado, a prótese peniana pode ser indicada.",

Such profound disturbances of maternal affection and behavior often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, were usually prolonged and distressing and, with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the descriptive term “maternal bonding disorder.” A postnatal mental illness and the memory of severe pain during labor were the only two factors significantly associated with the occurrence of such disorders and there was no direct evidence of any predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences.",

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient.

There is no evidence, however, for a direct relationship between specific hormone alterations and psychiatric, nosologic entities in the critical periods (premenstrual, postpartum, menopausal). The menopausal psychosyndrome can develop as a result of a chain reaction triggered by the fairly universal and specific vasomotor symptoms: hot flushes and night sweats. The hormone substitution therapy of menopause may have a prompt effect both on the somatic and psychic symptoms, by suspending the domino effect.

There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

      "abstract": "Genital self-mutilation is usually believed to be rare and to be predominantly practiced by men, especially those suffering grave mental illness. Castration occupies a central place in psychoanalytical theory, which suggests various symbols for the supposedly diverse fantasy of castration. A review of the literature revealed only about 60 cases. 3 diagnostic categories have been suggested for such cases: schizophrenics, transvestites or transsexuals, and patients with religious and cultural complexes. Factors believed to be common to persons practicing genital self-mutilation include intense sexual confusion, masochistic relationships with and submission to women, strong feminine identification, repudiation of the penis, and depression relieved by the mutilation. Explicit motivations were expressed in over 60% of cases, including desire to be a woman, existence of homosexual sentiments, real or imagined illness, and heterosexual sentiments. Extreme religiosity, psychotic symptoms, and a feeling of failure in the masculine role are often mentioned. 5 patients in 1 series of 53 attempted suicide and 1 succeeded. 87% were considered psychotic. 25% ingested alcohol before the act. 3 characteristics among psychotic subjects suggest a high risk of mutilation: very young psychotic men with sexual obsessions and fears, older men with psychotic depression or grave somatic illness, and men tending to become violent on drinking alcohol. Nonpsychotic subjects tend to display rage against themselves. Nonpsychotic transsexuals often had old fantasies of mutilation, and in 1/5 of cases some previous attempt had been made. A series of 3 cases observed by the author displayed a variety of circumstances: a 23-year old man with no observed psychosis wished to be free of sexual tumult and desire to masturbate for religious reasons, a 42-year old man had a fit of delirium and castrated himself with a saber, and a 32-year old chronic psychotic emasculated himself with his pajama cord and died shortly thereafter. Very few cases of female self-mutilation have been observed.",

However, it can considerably reduce motivation to the treatment, overcoming the illness, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and in general worsen the quality of their life. Manifestations of the depressed mood of cancer patients are similar to manifestations of the depressed mood of the patients having chronic or deadly diseases. However, there are features which depend on some factors, the most important of which is the disease stage. The results obtained allow to draw a conclusion that the features of the depressed mood at the second stage of the disease are connected with acceptation of the diagnosis and can manifest in the feeling of a punishment expectation, loss of interests in previous hobbies and communication restrictions; the features of a depressed mood at the third stage are determined by the disease dynamics and the further forecast, and can manifest in the analysis of the previous mistakes, absence of of hopes for the future, disgust for themselves and feeling of uselessness.",

Various strategies for the treatment of SSRI-related sexual dysfunction have been studied, including: awaiting spontaneous remission of sexual dysfunction; reducing the dose of medication; taking a \"drug holiday\"; adding another drug to help reverse sexual symptoms; changing antidepressants; or initially starting with a different antidepressant that is known to have fewer or no sexual side effects. Overall, it is important to address sexual health when caring for a patient--to improve drug compliance and the patient's well being.",

The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo-graphic factors must be taken into account.

      "title": "Sexsomnia and Sexual Assault",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

However affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms and anxiety, also occur during the course of OCD. How do affective symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms relate to each other during the longterm course of OCD? These questions were investigated during provoked obessive-compulsive symptoms as well as during the six-years-course of OCD.

Two major patterns occurred: (a) A primarily affective disorder, either manic or depressive; and, more frequently, (b) an organic reaction (toxic psychosis) with associated paranoid-hallucinatory and/or affective (usually depressive) components. No consistent correlation could be obtained with regard to drug dosage and onset, duration, or type of psychosis. Suicidal tendencies were present in several cases. After the ACTH or cortisone was discontinued, termination of the psychosis occurred spontaneously in the organic reactions. The affective disorders required electroconvulsive therapy. A comparison is made between these states and psychoses appearing in naturally occurring hyperadrenalism or Cushing's syndrome. The following factors involved in the production of these psychotic reactions are considered significant: The physiological effects of the hyperadrenal state on the central nervous system. The influence of the underlying disease process. The premorbid personality. Only in a few cases were recognizable psychotic trends present before treatment. It is felt that in most instances the previous personality pattern determined the psychological content of the psychosis, but not its onset. A complete understanding of the interrelationships of all of these physiological and psychological mechanisms is not possible at the present time.",

It only involves some peculiar sensori-motor symptoms that occur for a short period of the day and do not even occur every day. So why bother treating the disorder? The clinically significant morbidity of RLS involves its disruption of quality of life (QoL) more than any of its specific symptom features. RLS patients complain of sleep disruption (1) and sensory problems involving pain and discomfort (2). They may have some possible cognitive impairments (3). The first two of these clinical features, however, represent the large majority of patient complaints. In a large survey of the general population in the United States, those with moderate to severe RLS symptoms reported two types of major complaints: discomfort and pain for 88% and sleep disturbance for 76% (4). But such complaints, even when dramatic, may not be clinically significant. What indication do we have that these symptoms reported by RLS patients adversely affect normal living, thereby justifying considerable treatment efforts? Health-related QoL studies address this critical question of the clinical significance of disease-related complaints. RLS is not known to shorten life but does it significantly disrupt life? The answer for this question comes best from the QoL evaluations.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Men's Health: Male Sexual Dysfunction.",
      "abstract": "Human sexual function is complex and multidimensional, with physiologic and psychological components. The common sexual dysfunctions in men have significant overlap. Low sexual desire in men includes a lack of interest in thinking about sex or in being sexual, alone or with a partner. Sexual health counseling often is helpful. Physicians should prescribe supplemental testosterone only if it is clearly indicated. (Sexual dysfunction is an off-label use of testosterone.) Supplementation is not beneficial for men with a normal total testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection sufficient for sexual satisfaction. The cause typically is multifactorial. The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapies for most patients with ED. Their use is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates. Peyronie disease is an acquired penile abnormality that causes curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. Premature ejaculation is defined as a lack of ejaculatory control that is associated with distress. All pharmacotherapies for premature ejaculation are used off label. First-line treatment options include daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, paroxetine), on-demand clomipramine, and topical penile anesthetics. Psychotherapeutic and physical therapies also have been shown to be effective.",

      "abstract": "Suicide, this very complex and multicausal human behaviour, is related to several psychiatric-medical, psycho-social and demographic suicide risk factors. Psychological autopsy studies consistently show that over 90 percent of suicide victims have at least one (mostly untreated) current major mental disorder, most frequently major depressive episode (56-87%) substance-related disorders (26-55%) and schizophrenia (6-13%). As suicidal behaviour in patients with mood disorders seems to be state-dependent phenomenon (i.e., it decreases or vanishes after the clinical recovery), the succesful acute and long-term treatment of mood disorders is crutial for suicide prevention [1]. However, depression is freuently underreferred, underdiagnosed and undertreated (and in the case of unrecognized bipolarity mistreated), and the rate of adequate antidepressant pharmacotherapy among depressed suicide victims is less than 20%, which is disturbingly low [2]. The marked decrease in antidepressant utilization among children and adolescents most recently in the United States, The Netherlands and Canada coincided with a sharp increase in the rates of completed suicide in this subpopulation [3].\r\n\r\nThe most important pharmacotherapy-related factors of suicide in depression are: 1/ lack of treatment, 2/ inadequate treatment, 3/ the first 10-14 days of the treatment, particularly in the case of insufficient care and/or lack of co-medication with anxiolytics, 4/ early termination of the therapy either by the patient or by the doctor, 5/ lack of the long-term treatment in chronic or recurrent cases, and 6/ nonresponse and treament resistance. Most recent findings strongly suggest that antidepressant monotherapy (unprotected by mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) can worsen the short-and long-term course of bipolar depression and increases the risk of suicidal behaviour [4].",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

The correlates of emotional incapacities, emotional hypersensitivity, and normal emotional activities in psychopaths are studied and discussed in this paper. Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

      "title": "Aportaciones de aripiprazol en el tratamiento de pacientes agudos con esquizofrenia.",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

This article reports the case of a 20‐year‐old woman who has had absence epilepsy for 11 years that is evoked by thinking or talking about driving an automobile. This stimulus consistently precipitated absence seizures, as defined by clinical and electroencephalographic criteria. An emotionally traumatic early childhood event may play a role in the triggering mechanism. A similar case has not been reported. RÉSUMÉ Les crises d'épilepsie peuvent étre provoquées par de nombreux mécanismes inhabituels. Certains sont excessivement rares et surprenants, et restent apparemment d'observation isolée, chez un seul patient. Nous rapportons l'observation d'une femme de 20 ans qui présentait des crises à type d'absences depuis 11 ans, ces crises étant induites par l'évocation mentale ou verbale de la conduite automobile. Ce stimulus a provoqué de façon reproductible des absences cliniques et eléctroencéphalographiques. Un antécédent affectif traumatisant remontant à la petite enfance peut avoir joué un rôle dans le mécanisme de déclenchement. Aucune observation semblable n'a été rapportée antérieurement.

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day) that are repetitive and difficult to control. In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning.

      "title": "Gambling: The hidden disorder",
      "abstract": "Statement of the Problem: Gambling is common in Australian society – nearly 75 per cent of Australian adults gamble in any year. About 300,000 Australians have a gambling problem, but only 10 per cent of people with problematic gambling behaviour seek help. The hidden nature of gambling disorder has the minimal signs and symptoms concealing the level of severity associated with this condition subsequently causing significant dysfunction for individuals, and families. Findings: Current research recognises that the course of the disorder can vary by type of gambling as well as life circumstances, and acknowledges the overwhelming evidence indicating its association with consistently high rates of comorbid psychopathology-particularly mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders; other impulse control disorders; bipolar disorder; and antisocial personality disorder. For instance, a meta-analysis of 11 population surveys found high mean prevalence for nicotine dependence (60.1%), a substance use disorder (57.5%), depressive disorders (37.9%), and anxiety disorders (37.4%). Theoretical Orientation: As the largest Victorian service, Gambler’s Help Southern (GHS) offers a range of evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions often individually tailored and underpinned by CognitiveBehaviour Therapy (CBT), minimal or brief interventions, Motivational Enhancement Therapies (MET), mindfulness-based therapies, group and couple therapies. Newly created interactive online video psychological interventions and prevention programs will be made available to individuals with problematic gambling behaviour, and families who are mostly new to treatment. Financial counselling delivers a range of interventions integrated with therapeutic and other services. GHS assists close to 2,000 people across Melbourne southern catchments per annum. Conclusion: While psychological treatment approaches and interventions are essential to manage tertiary prevention of gambling, influencing public policy changes are equally necessary, supporting a range of strategies from prevention, health promotion and treatment, at individual, community, industry and government levels.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

      "abstract": "In the USA, severe psychiatric illness after childbirth strikes one woman for every 1000 births, or about 3500 women each year. An unrecorded number of new mothers experience lesser degrees of postpartum illness, and two distinct forms of severe illness can be distinguished. One form, called postpartum psychosis, is an agitated, very changeable condition, often characterized by confusion, hallucinations, delusions and sometimes episodes of violent behaviour. The other condition, major postpartum depression, begins two or three weeks after childbirth, and is characterized by confusion, depression of mood, and often with exhaustion, headache and digestive upset. Mixtures of the two severe disorders occur frequently. This volume contains a number of essays which support the position that postpartum disorders are primarily organic and are mainly disorders of hormonal deficit. They develop as the endocrine system falls back from the hyperactivity of pregnancy toward or beyond the levels of the prior non-pregnant state. Tremendous therapeutic opportunities exist or are imminent for both the organic and the psychological components of postpartum mental illness.",

      "title": "Old age depression and its treatment.",
      "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

      "title": "Reactive psychoses revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer.. Psychosocial Treatment Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo alto, Ca1991Google Scholar, 18.Kissane D.W. Love A. Hatton A. et al.The effect of cognitive-existential group psychotherapy on survival in early stage breast cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4255-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19.Fawzy F.I. Fawzy N. Hyun C.S. et al.Malignant melanoma: effects of an early structured psychiatric intervention, coping and affective state on recurrence and survival 6 years later.arch General Psychiatr. 1993; 50: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar]. Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

A apresentação deste caso clínico justifica-se pela incidência crescente deste diagnóstico e pela importância do reconhecimento atempado de fatores causais reversíveis para o mesmo, que permita a realização de tratamento dirigido e a minimização de complicações. Descrição do Caso: Homem de 70 anos, solteiro, ex-fumador, com antecedentes de alcoolismo e de comportamentos sexuais de risco. É trazido pela filha à consulta por um quadro com quatro anos de evolução de alteração comportamental, com episódios de heteroagressividade, discurso incoerente, perda progressiva de autonomia e autonegligência e descoordenação motora associada a alterações da marcha com quedas frequentes. Destaca-se a deteção, duas semanas antes da data da consulta, de lesão cutânea escrotal com 4x2cm de diâmetro e 2cm de espessura, de consistência elástica, indolor, ulcerada, compatível com goma sifilítica. Por suspeita de sífilis terciária é encaminhado para o serviço de urgência (SU), com posterior internamento e confirmação de neurossífilis, tendo cumprido terapêutica prolongada com penicilina endovenosa (EV), com melhoria do quadro neurológico. Três meses depois é reinternado por reativação de neurossífilis e medicado com penicilina, seguindo-se, após alta, um agravamento do seu estado clínico, com caquexia, diminuição global da força muscular mais evidente ao nível dos membros inferiores, disartria marcada e disfagia progressiva. Faleceu 11 meses depois, por pneumonia associada aos cuidados de saúde. Comentário: Neste caso clínico destaca-se a presença de uma causa potencialmente reversível de demência: neurossífilis. Após tratamento verificou-se uma melhoria parcial do quadro; contudo, sem completa recuperação e com posterior deterioração progressiva. Este aspeto justifica-se pelo diagnóstico tardio e pela presença concomitante de outros fatores etiológicos para a síndroma demencial. Pelo conhecimento dos antecedentes pessoais, do contexto sociofamiliar e do estado prévio do seu doente, o médico de família encontra-se numa posição privilegiada para o diagnóstico precoce e orientação destas situações.",

Nach der geltenden deutschen Rechtsprechung kann die Fahrerlaubnis nur bei erwiesener Nichteignung verweigert oder entzogen werden. Die Fahrerlaubnis kann mit Auflagen beziehungsweise Einschraenkungen verbunden werden. Die neurologische Beurteilung der Fahreignung hat in der Regel symptom- und krankheitsbezogen zu erfolgen. Manche neurologische Funktionsstoerungen werden von Betroffenen selbst trotz eines gravierenden Ausmasses nicht wahrgenommen. Problematisch fuer die aktive Teilnahme am Strassenverkehr sind insbesondere paroxysmal auftretende Stoerungen mit Wiederholungsneigung. Gehen diese rezidivierenden paroxysmalen Stoerungen mit Bewusstseinstruebung oder -verlust einher, ist die Fahreignung nicht gegeben. Allen paroxysmal rezidivierenden Stoerungen ist gemeinsam, dass der Zeitpunkt ihres Wiederauftretens unvorhersagbar ist. Die nicht epileptischen anfallsartigen Stoerungen koennen in den meisten Faellen dauerhaft medikamentoes unterdrueckt werden. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D353923. (KfV/A)",

The effects which lead to sexual dysfunction are mostly reported by patients which are themselves reluctant to discuss with their physician. Antihistaminics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and minor tranquilizer may have an adverse effect on sexual function. Because elderly people are prone to adverse drug effects, they arc expected to experience more side effects on their sexual life with commonly prescribed drugs than younger ones are to. Refraining drug use and attentive listening may help the patient restore his normal sexual life.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

Einleitend wird auf die Sorgfaltspflicht eines Lenkers verwiesen. Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft. Der Autor geht weiters auf Arzneimittelinteraktionen bei Einnahme von 2 oder mehreren Medikamenten gleichzeitig, auf das Zusammenwirken von Medikamenten und Alkohol sowie auf alkoholhaltige Medikamente und die im jeweiligen Fall zu erfuellenden Sorgfaltspflichten des Lenkers ein.

Alexithymia is a syndrome that is defined by the inability to recognize and express emotions. It is a common feature in patients with psychoactive abuse disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosomatic disorders such as gastrointestinal complaints, migraine, dermatological symptoms, and irritable bowel syndrome. Alexithymia is associated with a failure to use adaptive affect regulation such as modulating arousal, appropriately expressing or suppressing emotions, tolerating painful emotions and cognitive assimilation. Alexithymia is presumed to play a very important role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms and it is a risk factor for a psychosomatic condition. It is of clinical importance that the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are able to recognize that their physical symptoms may be related to their depression or anxiety disorder which are the most common mental disorders.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

It takes an average of 17 years from the onset of OCD to obtain appropriate treatment. OCD tends to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Patients may be secretive or lack insight about their illness. Many health care providers are not familiar with the symptoms or are not trained in providing treatment. Some people may not have access to treatment, and sometimes insurance plans do not cover behavioral therapy, although the situation is improving. This lack of access or coverage is unfortunate, since earlier diagnosis and proper treatment can help patients to avoid the suffering associated with OCD and lessen the risks of related problems, such as depression, marital difficulties, and problems related to employment. 4 OCD may have a genetic basis. 5 Concordance for OCD is greater among pairs of monozygotic twins (80 to 87 percent) than among pairs of dizygotic twins (47 to 50 percent). 6 The prevalence of OCD is increased among the first-degree relatives of patients with OCD, as compared with the relatives of control subjects, and the age at onset in the proband is inversely related to the risk of OCD among the relatives. 5,7,8 There is evidence of a dominant or codominant mode of transmission of OCD. 9-12 the clinical problem",

In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders. Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

      "abstract": "Little is known of the nature and origins of the attitudes that older people have towards ageing, disease, and medical treatments. Several studies on older people in the community have suggested under-reporting of symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, including the possibility that some older people regard disease processes as a natural feature of ageing and, consequently, feel that medical intervention may have little to offer.To investigate the perceptions of older people about the significance of symptoms and what action they would take in response to particular symptoms.Thirty-three men and 77 women attending social clubs (median age 78 years) were opportunistically selected and assessed using a supervised questionnaire.Many symptoms classically associated with common diseases were often considered to represent disease as well as to be normal for old people. Most would consult a doctor if they were to experience them. Some important symptoms, such as blackouts or paralysis of a limb, were not considered to be normal. Non-specific symptoms of psychiatric disturbances were also frequently considered normal but were not considered to represent disease. Whether or not a doctor would be consulted was often, but not always, related to whether a symptom was thought to represent a disease. Consulting a pharmacist was seldom considered appropriate.Doctors working with elderly people need to consider how beliefs about health and disease might affect what is reported to them. Specific enquiry needs to be made about symptoms of psychiatric disturbances. These findings suggest that there is a case for increased health education at retirement age.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

The karyotype 47,XXY originates from either paternal or maternal meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis. KS males are very likely to exhibit marked gonadal dysfunctions, presenting both in severely attenuated spermatogenesis as well as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In addition, neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments, as well as cardiovascular, metabolic and bone disorders are often found in KS and might explain for an increased morbidity/mortality. All conditions in KS are likely to be induced by both gene overdosage effects resulting from supernumerary X‐chromosomal genes as well as testosterone deficiency. Notwithstanding, the clinical features are highly variable between KS men. Symptoms can become obvious at infancy, childhood, or adolescence. However, the majority of KS subjects is diagnosed during adulthood. KS adolescents require specific attention regarding pubertal development, in order to exploit their remaining fertility potential and allow for timely and tailored testosterone replacement. The chances for sperm retrieval might decline with age and could be hampered by testosterone replacement; therefore, cryostorage of spermatozoa is an option during adolescence, before the decompensation of endocrine and exocrine testicular functions becomes more overt. Sperm from semen or surgically retrieved, in combination with intracytoplasmic sperm injection enables KS males to become biological fathers of healthy children. The aim of this article is to present the current knowledge on KS, to guide clinical care and to highlight research needs.",

Psychogenic and medicamentous depressions can also exist [1-4].

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident).

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Patients with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Depression is the third most common illness among patients with schizophrenia which negatively affects the course of the disease and significantly contributes to the mortality rate, due to increased suicide. Depression, along with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, is one of the main factors that significantly decreases the quality of life and the disease prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, depression increases the frequency of exacerbations and readmissions, decreases the quality and duration of remissions and is associated with more frequent substance abuse and an increased economic burden. Data on the prevalence of depression among patients with schizophrenia are contradictory and are associated with a low detection rate of depression in such patients, a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and difficulties in differentiation between extrapyramidal and negative symptoms. The average prevalence of depression that meets the diagnostic criteria of major depressive episodes in patients with schizophrenia is 25% at a specific point, and 60% over the course of a lifetime; the frequency of subsyndromal depression is much higher. It is essential to distinguish between primary (axial syndrome) and secondary depressive symptoms (extrapyramidal symptoms, psychogenic or nosogenic reactions, social factors, etc.) to determine treatment strategies. The published data relating to randomized clinical trials for the development of evidence-based guidelines are limited. Current recommendations are based mainly on the results of small-scale trials and reviews. Certain atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, clozapine) are superior to typical antipsychotics in the reduction of depressive symptoms. Clozapine is effective in the management of patients at risk from suicide. The additional prescription of antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are not always effective and are only possible following the management of acute psychosis in cases when antipsychotic monotherapy proved to be ineffective.",

Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

      "abstract": "Objective U.S. military special operation forces represent the most elite units of the U.S. Armed Forces. Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "abstract": "Arhinia is a rare anomaly in which a total absence of the nose and parts of the olfactory system occurs. It is frequently associated with various multiple central nervous system (CNS) and somatic anomalies of different degrees of severity, with high mortality rate. Twelve cases that have been reported in the literature are analyzed according to multiple criteria. The anomalies that have been found to be associated with arhinia are: lack of olfactory bulbs and nerves, missing paranasal sinuses, high arched or cleft palate, various eye anomalies, low set ears - all in a very high incidence. Various degrees of CNS malformations have been found in part of the cases. Somatic anomalies have been reported in 50% of the cases. In two cases chromosome 9 anomalies have been reported. A classification is suggested in which arhinia is classified into arhinia (total absence of the nose and rhinencephalon) and partial arhinia (partial absence of the nose), each may or may not be associated with other malformations (facial, CNS and somatic).",

      "title": "Testosterone Deficiency and Mood in Aging Men: Pathogenic and Therapeutic Interactions",
      "abstract": "AbstractIn contrast to women, men do not experience a sudden cessation of gonadal function comparable to menopause. However, there is a progressive reduction in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function in aging men: testosterone (T) levels decline through both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) mechanisms and there is a loss of the circadian rhythm of T secretion. In cohorts of men 75 years of age, mean plasma T levels are 35% lower than comparable young men, and more than 25% of men over 75 appear to be T-deficient. Such age-associated T deficiency, which has been termed 'andropause', is thought to be responsible for a variety of symptoms experienced by elderly men, such as weakness, fatigue, reduced muscle and bone mass, impaired haematopoiesis, oligospermia, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and memory impairment. However, it has been difficult to establish correlations between these symptoms and plasma T levels. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that T replacement leads to symptom relief, particularly with respect to muscle strength, bone mineral density and haematopoiesis. Studies to date on the specific association between psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood, and T levels have been methodologically flawed. Overall, data suggest that although hypogonadism is not central to major depressive disorder (MDD), HPG hypofunction may have aetiological importance in mild depressive conditions, such as dysthymia.Key Words: andropausetestosterone deficiencydepressionmalegeriatric Additional informationNotes on contributorsStuart N SeidmanJoyce Laing works in the Department of Child and Family Psychiatry, Playfield House, Cupar, Fife, and is a Consultant Art Therapist to Psychiatric Hospitals and Prisons and Chairwoman of the Scottish Society of Art and Psychology.Dr Niculescu Dan, Centrul de Reumatologie, Str.

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "title": "Cas de dépression post-partum chez une femelle orang-outan",
      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "abstract": "Background: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are usually at an initial stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, some patients with aMCI do not present biomarkers of amyloid pathology characteristic of AD. The significance of amyloid-negative aMCI is not presently clear. Objective: To know the etiology and prognosis of amyloid-negative aMCI. Methods: Patients who fulfilled criteria for aMCI and were amyloid negative were selected from a large cohort of non-demented patients with cognitive complaints and were followed with clinical and neuropsychological assessments. Results: Few amyloid-negative aMCI had evidence of neurodegeneration at the baseline, as reflected in cerebrospinal fluid elevated tau protein levels. About half of the patients remained essentially stable for long periods of time. Others manifested a psychiatric disorder that was not apparent at baseline, namely major depression or bipolar disorder. Remarkably, about a quarter of patients developed neurodegenerative disorders other than AD, mostly frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body disease. Conclusion: Amyloid-negative aMCI is a heterogeneous condition. Many patients remain clinically stable, but others may later manifest psychiatric conditions or evolve to neurodegenerative disorders. Prudence is needed when communicating to the patient and family the results of biomarkers, and clinical follow-up should be advised.",

      "abstract": "An increase in the number of victims of psycho-violence, which has a traumatic effect on the personality, causing emotional stress, stress, discomfort, and depression, necessitates studying the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

      "title": "Could This be a New Syndrome? Report of Seven Cases with Characteristic Mental and Physical Degeneracy",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY In a period of 5 years, seven children have been seen who show a specific state of mental and physical degeneracy occurring sporadically in otherwise healthy families. The only possible predisposing factor was birth trauma, which was present in 5. Lethargy in early infancy is followed by more than a decade of great excitability and stubborn restlessness. There is delay in motor development and outstanding clumsiness of voluntary movements. The face is often broad and flat with straight eyebrows. More constant are a ‘gosling’ mouth, a short neck and occasional postural lordosis (‘marabou stance’). The associated eye defects include strabismus, sévère myopia and a tendency to retinal detachment. There are unusual dominance patterns. The IQ is between 50 and 75. Scholastic attainments are poor except for relatively good ability and interest in reading. The outstanding characteristics are typically emotionally conditioned hand movements (rubbing and wringing), a tubular quality of voice, an abnormal sleep rhythm and very late bladder control. This consistent combination of clinical features can hardly be regarded as coincidental. No reports of similar children have been found in the literature. RÉSUMÉ Un nouveau syndrome ? A propos de sept cas présentant une dégénérescence caractéristique mentale et physique Durant une période de 5 ans, sept enfants ont été suivis qui présentaient une dégénéres‐cence mentale et physique, survenant sporadiquement dans les families par ailleurs en bonne santé. Le seul facteur predisposant qui pourrait être retenu est un traumatisme à la naissance 5 fois présent. Un état léthargique dans la première enfance a été suivi durant plus de dix ans par une grande excitabilité et une instabilityé permanente. II y a eu un retard dans le développement moteur et une maladresse évidente des mouvements volontaires. La figure est souvent large et aplatie avec des sourcils rectilignes. Plus fréquemment reléves ont été une bouche en bee d'oison, un cou court et une lordose posturale occasionnelle (tenue de marabout). Les troubles oculaires associés comprennent le strabisme, une myopie sévère et une tendance au décollement rétinien. On observe des stéréotypes anormax. Le QI est compris entre 50 et 75. Les résultats scolaires sont pauvres excepte une aptitude relative‐ment bonne pour la lecture et un intérêt certain pour cette acquisition. Les caractéristiques les plus spécifiques sont des mouvements de mains déclenchés par l'émotion: mouvements de frottements et de torsions, le caractére caverneux de la voix, le rythme anormal du sommeil et un contrôle vésical très tardif. II est difficile de considérer comme accidentelle cette combinaison de manifestations cliniques particulières; il n'a pas été observé de cas semblables dans la littérature. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Handelt es sich um ein neues Syndrom ? Bericht über sieben Fälle mil charakteristischer geistiger und physicher Degeneration Über einen Zeitraum von 5 Jahren wurden sieben Kinder mit einem spezifischen Zustand geistiger und physischer Degeneration gesehen, der sporadisch in ansonsten gesunden Familien auftrat. Der einzige mögliche prädisponierende Faktor war ein Geburtstrauma bei fünf Kindern. Nach einem Stadium der Lethargie in der fruuhen Kindheit folgt ein Jahrzehnt großer Erregbarkeit und nicht zu beeinflussender Unruhe. Die motorische Entwicklung ist verspätet und es findet sich eine ungewöhnliche Ungeschichicklichkeit bei willkürlichen Bewegungen. Das Gesicht ist oft breit und flach mit geraden Augenbrauen. Noch haufiger findet sich ein ‘Schnabelmund’, ein kurzer Hals und gelegentlich eine posturale Lordose (‘Marabuhaltung’). Zu den damit verbundenen Augenkrankheiten gehSren Strabismus, schwere Myopie und eine Neigung zur Netzhautablösung. Es gibt ungewöhliche Dominanzerscheinungen. Der QI liegt zwischen 50 und 75. Die Fähigkeiten in der Schule sind gering außer einem relativ guten Interesse und Fertigkeit im Lesen. Beson‐ders charakteristisch sind typisch emotionell bedingte Handbewegungen (Reiben und Ringen), eine Röhrenstimme, ein abnormer Schlafrhythmus und eine sehr späte Kontrolle der Blasenfunktion. Diese gleichbleibende Kombination klinischer Erscheinungen kann schwerlich als zufallig betrachtet werden. In der Literatur fanden wir keine Berichte iiber ahnliche Kinder. RESUMEN Podria tratarse de un nuevo sindrome?. Aportacion de 1 casos con una degeneracidn mental y fisica caracteristicas En un perfodo de 5 años han sido vistos 7 niños que presentaban un estado especifico de degeneracyón ffsica y mental que aparecia de forma esporádica en familias que gozaban por otra parte de buena salud. El único factor predisponente posible era un trauma del parto presente en 5 ca sos. El cuadro constaba de letargia en los primeros meses de la vida, sequida de más de 10 años de gran excitabilidad y comportamiento tumultuoso con hiper motilidad. Existe un retraso en el desarrollo motor y una notable torpeza en los movimientos voluntarios. La cara es con frecuencia ancha y plana con cejas rectas. Más constante es la boca de “tipo de pato”, cuello corto y una ocasional lordosis postural (‘position de mara‐bii’). Los defectos asociados oculares que se presentan incluyen estrabismo, miopia grave y tendencia al desprendimiento de retina. Existe tambisén esquemás de dominancia alter‐nados. El CI oscila entre 50 y 75. El rendimiento excolar es pobre, excepto a lo que respecta a une relativa habilidad e interes para la lectura. Otras caracteristicas sobresalientes son movimientos de maños condicionados por la emotividad (restregárselas y estrujárselas), una voz de tipo tubular, un ritmo de sueño anormal y un control vesical muy tardio. Toda esta combinatión de caracteristicas clfnicas no pueden ser consideradas como simple coincidencia. No se han encontrado descritos en la literatura ningún caso similar.",

Delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech that have a sudden onset and return to normal within a month are indicative of a brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder is an intermediate diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophrenia. Another important distinction separates schizophreniform disorder from a diagnosis of schizophrenia—level of impairment. Symptoms of schizophrenia are the same as for schizophreniform disorder, except for the duration criteria, which must last at least 6 months.

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike. Teškoće sa kojima se susreću su mnogobrojne počev od problema pripreme za čas fizičkog vaspitanja, učešća u takmičarskim igrama, preko problema čitanja, pisanja i računanja. U osnovi ovih teškoća leži problem motoričkog učenja. Zbog svega, vrlo je važno koristiti odgovarajuće strategije za rad sa ovim učenicima. Pravovremenim tretmanom, primenom odgovarajućih metoda i strategija u radu može se uticati na dalji tok i ishod ovog razvojnog poremećaja.",

      "abstract": "Psychogene Bewegungsstörungen machen bis zu 5% aller Bewegungsstörungen in spezialisierten Ambulanzen aus. Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

      "abstract": "Menstrual cycle-related symptoms are associated with the intrinsic hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms can be physical, behavioral, or emotional and include problems such as dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Because of the emotional and behavioral aspects of menstrual cycle-related symptoms, it is likely that clinical psychiatrists will encounter these symptoms in their daily practice and should therefore be familiar with their diagnosis, prevalence, etiology, and treatment. As many as 2.5 million women are affected by menstrual disorders each year, which can have a profound impact on their quality of life. Although a definitive etiology has yet to be established, fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone as well as genetic factors are thought to contribute to the occurrence of menstrual disorders. Current treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (for dysmenorrhea), lifestyle changes, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and ovulation suppression (e.g., with oral contraceptives). Treatment with oral contraceptives (OCs), particularly extended or continuous use, may significantly reduce the incidence of menstrual cycle-related symptoms.",

      "abstract": "A variety of reactions are observed after a major trauma. In the majority of cases these resolve without any long-term consequences. In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Priapism is a rare urological emergency characterized by painful erection exceeding 4-6 h and generally occurring independently of sexual desire and sexual relations. The etiology is broad and various. The ischemic type represents 95% of all cases of priapism. No cause is determined in 60% of cases of ischemic priapism, while hematological diseases, a history of drug use, malignity or a history of neurological disease can be identified in 40%. The drugs most commonly associated with priapism are antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticoagulants and antihypertensives. Although antipsychotic agents are implicated in 15-26% of cases of priapism, the mechanism involved in drug-associated priapism is unclear. The peripheral alpha 1 blocking activities of psychotropic agents or central serotonin-like activities are, however, implicated. The phenothiazine group antipsychotic agents chlorpromazine and thioridazine have the highest alpha adrenergic activity and are the antipsychotics most reported in association with priapism. Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic with high alpha 1 antagonistic activity, and cases of priapism associated with use of chlorpromazine at varying doses and for varying durations have been reported. In this case report, the priapism in the patient with schizoaffective disorder is associated with intramuscular injection of chlorpromazine, in this regard the priapism cases and predictive factors in the literature is reviewed for the aim of increasing the sensitivity of clinician across the adverse effects of drugs and the importance of adequate psychiatric history and medical history taking and registering adverse effects of drugs is emphasized.",

      "title": "Sexuality and Chronic Pain",
      "abstract": "Pain relief is a significant determinant of quality of life for cancer survivors. However, effective pain management is often complicated by the multiple determinants of the chronic pain experience. For a minority of survivors, nociceptive or neuropathic pain may develop or persist following a pain-free interval of variable duration despite apparent recovery of damaged tissue and continued disease-free status. Additionally, survivors may also suffer from other chronic pain conditions that may have been acquired before or after the cancer diagnosis and treatment. The experience of chronic pain often has deleterious effects on sexual functioning, related either to the noxious stimulus of pain or as a negative consequence of pain management. Common pharmacological approaches and interventional techniques utilized in the treatment of pain have documented effects on sexual functioning. Current treatment strategies offer varying degrees of symptom resolution. Future research is needed to examine the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of chronic pain and medications for pain management on sexual function. Further research is also needed to address the efficacy of treatment options, including combining medical interventions with sexual counseling in the treatment of sexual disorders.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

Usually such patients have been defined as those who have been hospitalized continuously for at least six months or more [14-16]. In studies concerning long-stay patients, the subjects have been predominantly schizophrenics, their clinical symptoms are severe, and it is problematic to place them anywhere other than in a hospital [17-19]. Psychiatric inpatients have in recent years been found to be more severely disturbed than was previously the case, possibly because of the deinstitutionalization process [1 8-20].",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "abstract": "Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder is characterized with unwanted, uncontrollable and persistent genital arousal symptoms that occur spontaneously in the absence of simultaneous sexual fantasy, sexual desire or sexual stimulation. The condition may last for hours or days. Patients often find it difficult to share this condition with their health care providers because they are afraid of being diagnosed with hypersexuality and they often get different psychiatric diagnoses such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. Therefore, little is known about the real prevalence, pathophysiology or etiology of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. In addition, since there is no study conducted in this field, our information in this area is limited to case reports. Although there is no consensus about the treatment of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder in the psychiatric literature, there are some case reports about the use of pregabaline, clomipramine, duloxetine, clonazepam, varenicline, olanzapine, risperidone in addition to the case reports on treatment with hypnotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this case report, we aimed to present the detailed description of a successful treatment procedure with duloxetine in a forty two years old female patient diagnosed with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. She had been using various antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers for sixteen years with different psychiatric misdiagnoses like Bipolar Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder and yet, had not shared her symptoms of genital arousal with any psychiatrist previously.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Nonetheless, many clinicians do not have easy access to reliable information concerning sexual side effects of pharmacological agents. This handy reference provides up-to-date and rapid access to the latest available data concerning sexual side effects of various pharmacological agents for psychiatrists and physicians. Initial chapters are devoted to a brief review of the physiology of sexual function, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the general population, and how to identify drug-induced sexual dysfunction. Following the initial overview chapters, subsequent chapters are be grouped by classes of drugs, allowing clinicians and physicians rapid access to clinically relevant information. Separate chapters are devoted to data concerning sexual side effects of antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, antipsychotic agents, antihypertensives, urological agents, cardiovascular drugs, and other classes of drugs. The chapters focus on common sexual side effects that may be unspoken causes of treatment noncompliance such as inability to ejaculate, anorgasmia, difficulty in reaching orgasm, erectile dysfunction, and lubrication failure. Reports of decreased libido are often difficult to interpret; for that reason, data concerning libido will only be reported if the evidence clearly supports a diagnosis of disturbed libido as a drug side effect. Final chapters are devoted to pharmacological treatment of sexual disorders.",

The review is devoted to one of the unsolved problems - this is a problem of autoaggressive behavior, which manifests itself in self-blame, self-abuse, self-injury, suicide, self-destructive behavior (drunkenness, alcoholism, drug addiction, risky sexual behavior, choice of extreme sports, dangerous occupations, provoking behavior), and it is one of the most relevant in the field of mental health. The risk factors for self-harm, both in the clinical and in the conventionally normal population, are usually considered within two large groups: a) external (environmental or psychosocial factors and traumatic events), b) internal (personal) factors and their interaction. Although most of the self-harm observed in normative mental development in adolescence, adolescence and young age is preclinical and is nonincidental, suicidal intentions can’t be completely ruled out, which requires mandatory testing and clarification of the possible suicide risk in self-destructive behavior within the planned therapy and the selection of relevant targets psychological correction. Since the main contingent requiring registration and assistance is someone who has committed a suicidal attempt, the prevention of a repeated autoaggressive action is the main task of the work of specialists providing psychological and medical and social assistance in the post-suicide period",

Ou seja, o sentimento contínuo de tristeza, astenia, associado ou não a um complexo de sintomas físicos e emocionais que interferem negativamente na aptidão e desempenho cotidiano. Independente da depressão não possuir predileção por sexo, existe prevalência no sexo feminino, a qual, geralmente é precedida por eventos marcantes, como a gestação, o parto e o período pós-parto. Os transtornos são representadas pela tríade: o baby blues iniciado no primeiro dia do puerpério, caracterizado por sintomas leves e progressão de intensidade no quinto dia, com resolução no décimo dia⁹. Com chance para conversão para DPP, em que os sintomas persistem até o terceiro mês pós parto, e potencial risco, na pré-disposição ou déficit terapêutico para psicose puerperal, um transtorno alarmante, cursando rapidamente com delírios, ideias de perseguição e alucinações.

      "title": "Double Syndromes:Autism Associated with Genetic, Medical and Metabolic Disorders",
      "abstract": "A number of conditions—genetic, metabolic, and medical syndromes—have a high rate (more than expected by chance; i.e., more than a few percent) or a very high rate (more than 20%) of several autism symptoms associated with them. In the presence of these syndromes, the diagnosis of autistic disorder or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is very often appropriate (Gillberg and Coleman 2000). These conditions are listed in Table 2.1. Some conditions, like Down syndrome, have a much lower rate of autistic symptoms than other of the listed syndromes, but, nonetheless, present a much higher rate than expected in the general population. A number of these syndromes are also discussed elsewhere in this volume, where the full range of cognitive and behavioral complications are addressed. Angelman syndrome is characterized by jerky movements, unprovoked laughter, and varying degrees of mental retardation, mostly severe or profound (Horsler and Oliver 2006). The rate of Angelman syndrome in the general population has been estimated at about 1 in 12,000 children, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio (Steffenburg, Gillberg, Steffenburg, &amp; Kyllerman 1996). Angelman syndrome (formerly known as ‘happy puppet syndrome’) is usually caused by a deletion of chromosome 15q11.2–12, which is similar, but not identical, to that found in children with Prader-Willi syndrome and is maternally, rather than paternally, inherited. The deletion includes a gene for the β-3 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (Saitoh et al. 1994). Sixty to 75% of patients have deletions or rearrangements in the long arm of chromosome 15, and the deletion is always on the maternal chromosome. A small proportion of cases have paternal disomy for chromosome 15. At least 20% of affected persons have normal chromosomes and no evidence of disomy. In some of these cases, recurrence in relatives may be observed. Such cases may be due to a dominant mutation of the UBE3 gene at 15q11–13 resulting in an Angelman phenotype only when transmitted by females. Differences in clinical presentation are related to the nature of the genetic defect (Lossie et al. 2001).",

      "abstract": "Millions of Americans suffer from anxiety disorders. Many with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder present initially to their primary care clinician. Effective treatment is possible in a busy primary care setting; therapy involves patient education and pharmacotherapy. Once other potential causes of symptoms of an anxiety disorder have been ruled out, the first step is to reassure the patient that he or she has a psychological condition-a very common one-and that symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed disease or going crazy or losing control. Educate and inform patients that complete clinical remission is achievable, often with medication alone. Begin treatment on day 1 with a long-acting benzodiazepine-such as alprazolam XR or clonazepam-or with the anxiolytic agent buspirone; at the same time, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The anxiolytic agent allays acute somatic symptoms until the full effects of the SSRI are manifest (often 4 to 6 weeks). The anxiolytic can then be gradually tapered. Referral to a psychiatrist for psychotherapy may be indicated when a patient refuses or cannot tolerate drug therapy, or when response to therapy is inadequate.",

      "title": "Psychological Bases of Symptom Reporting: Perceptual and Emotional Aspects of Chemical Sensitivity",
      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "title": "Recovery Versus Remission in Schizophrenia and Related Persistent Psychotic Disorders: no Contrasting but Complementary Models",
      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurological involvement has been reported in up to 80% of adults with Primary Sjogren’s syndrome (pSS) with psychiatric abnormalities including anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction being common. Psychosis due to pSS has been reported in adult patients but has never been previously reported in the adolescent/pediatric literature. Here we describe for the first time four cases of adolescent Sjogren’s syndrome that presented with psychotic symptoms. Rituximab treatment was followed by improvement of psychiatric symptoms in all patients. Case presentation 1 : 16 year old female without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with 4 days of abnormal behavior, tremors, insomnia, polyphagia, polyuria, and suicidal ideation. 2 : 16 year old female with a 4 year history of severe anxiety, OCD, and tic disorder treated with fluoxetine with partial benefit presented with an abrupt and severe worsening of anxiety, OCD and new auditory hallucinations. 3 : 19 year old female without significant past medical history presented with a 3 day history of progressively altered behavior, incoherent speech, insomnia, headache, and tangential thoughts. 4 : 17 year old female without significant past medical history presented with new onset suicidal ideation, paranoia, confusion, and emotional lability. Conclusion Psychosis is more common in autoimmune disease than previously known. To our knowledge, the four teenage women described above are the first reported patients with adolescent pSS manifesting as psychosis. pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young patients with new psychiatric disorders, even in the absence of sicca symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with rituximab infusions in all 4 of our patients, which suggests rituximab may be an effective treatment option that should be considered early after the diagnosis of pSS-associated psychiatric disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is generally defined as pain in the pelvic area that persisted for 3–6 months or longer. The pain can be constant or episodic and functionally disabling. Any dysfunction of the central nervous system can lead to central sensitization, which enhances and maintains pain as well as other symptoms that are mediated by the central nervous system. It occurs in subgroups of nearly every chronic pain condition and is characterized by multifocal pain and co-occurring somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is defined as a condition in which having one or more somatic symptoms, such as excessive worries, pressure, and catastrophic events. These symptoms can be very disruptive to a patient’s life and can cause significant distress. SSD cases with severe symptoms frequently undergo repeated medical investigations and the symptoms often lead patients to seek emergency medical treatment and consult with specialists repeatedly, which is a source of frustration for patients and clinicians. Here we report a case that Asian female with persistent CPPS with comorbid SSD, who got in trouble for up to 8 years. This case reminds clinicians to pay excessive attention to the diagnosis of CPPS with comorbid SSD after recovery from acute COVID-19, with hope of raising awareness in the identification of SSD and present new insight into appropriate treatment for each woman who suffers from it.",

      "title": "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV, McArdle disease) is a metabolic myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance manifested by rapid fatigue, myalgia, and cramps in exercising muscles. Symptoms are usually precipitated by isometric exercise or sustained aerobic exercise. Most individuals improve their exercise tolerance by exploiting the second-wind phenomenon with relief of myalgia and fatigue after a few minutes of rest. Age of onset is frequently in the first decade of life but can vary; however, diagnosis is typically delayed as myalgia and fatigability are dismissed/overlooked. Fixed muscle weakness occurs in approximately 25% of affected individuals, is more likely to involve proximal muscles, and is more common in individuals of advanced age. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria that can – on occasion – eventually result in acute renal failure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSDV is established in a proband with suggestive findings and by identification of biallelic PYGM (encoding glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form) pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing or – if genetic test results are not diagnostic – by assay of muscle myophosphorylase enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Although no cure for GSDV is available, affected individuals benefit from moderate-intensity aerobic training (e.g., walking or brisk walking, bicycling) to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle oxidative capacity. Pre-exercise ingestion of sports drinks containing simple carbohydrates improves exercise tolerance and may protect against exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. Surveillance: Annual routine physical examination and review of diet. Agents/circumstances to avoid: To prevent occurrence of cramps and myoglobinuria, avoid intense isometric exercise and maximal aerobic exercise. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the family-specific PYGM pathogenic variants are known, early detection of GSDV in relatives at risk ensures proper management to prevent muscle injury leading to rhabdomyolysis and to improve long-term outcome, particularly by development of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., regular exercise such as brisk walking) in childhood. Genetic counseling GSDV is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Once the pathogenic variants in the family are known, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Alongside a 'moral' superego, there may be a harsh and condemning superego, as well as evidence of a more 'perverse', sadistic superego. The individual may feel identified with the superego, or at the mercy of it, or it may be projected onto the therapist or others. Therapeutic work often reveals marked underlying depression. Illustrated with clinical vignettes, this chapter explores these different configurations and describes the challenge for the therapist to position themselves constructively in relation to these shifting internal objects.",

      "abstract": "Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome is a disorder causing massive colonic dilation with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. The actual incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is unclear; However, electrolyte imbalance, psychiatric disorders, the use of medications such as anticholinergics or antipsychotics, and recent abdominal surgery are the most common predisposing factors associated with this syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome is most likely caused due to impairment of the gut's motor system and an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system including a reduction in the activity of stimulatory neurotransmitters. The predisposition to psychotic disorders could be, in some instances, due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the brain and the gut’s autonomic nervous system. The symptoms of Ogilvie's syndrome are similar to mechanical obstruction of the colon but no physical cause of obstruction is usually present. Ogilvie's syndrome can be managed conservatively; however, if left untreated, Ogilvie's syndrome can lead to bowel perforation, which is associated with a high mortality risk. Antipsychotics have been considered the cornerstone treatment for psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Even though they are highly effective in treating psychiatric illnesses, their usage carries multiple risks. Overall, constipation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications with some classes posing more risk than others. Constipation can be severe and may lead to serious complications such as paralytic ileus, bowel ischemia, and death. We present here a case of delusional disorder managed with risperidone and complicated by intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This case reiterates the need to consider all complications of antipsychotic medications, even rare ones, and include them in the discussion with patients and their caregivers before commencement.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "abstract": "Psychological distress is a driver both of direct and indirect health care costs. Depression compromises functional well-being, such as work productivity. Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual performance. The prevalence of ED has been estimated as nearly 40% of men >40 years of age1 although these figures are contested.2 ED increases in frequency with age and is estimated to affect 15% of men aged 40–50 years, 45% of men in their 60s and 70% of men older than 70 years.3 Successful erection is a complex system involving reflex action (peripheral nerves and spinal cord), the limbic system (psychogenic stimuli) and the release of nitric oxide. Adequate levels of testosterone are required, and hence an intact hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular axis. Hence, ED can result from disease or treatment that produces hormonal deficiency, neurological impairment, problems with penile blood flow, disorders of tissue mechanics, psychological factors or any combination of these.\n\nLogically, ED secondary to testosterone deficiency should be treated by testosterone replacement. Testosterone levels in men decrease with age.4 Both epidemiological and observational studies have demonstrated that reduced testosterone is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. One meta-analysis showed lower testosterone and higher 17β oestradiol as significant risk predictors despite adjustment for age and body mass index.4 Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have been found to have lower testosterone levels than controls, and there is inverse correlation between testosterone and the incidence of major cardiovascular disease (CVD).4 A significant negative correlation has been reported between total testosterone levels and Framingham risk score.4 However, it has been pointed out that ‘It is unclear if this is a causal association or due to low testosterone being a biomarker of poor health’.4 Testosterone replacement as a treatment for …",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are frequent in dementia and often precede cognitive dysfunction. Their prevalence is difficult to establish because of differences in definitions, methodology, scales or origin of information. They result from a dysfunction in fronto-subcortical, striato-limbic and paralimbic structures involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In elderly people, 40-70% of the population has a mood disorder, and among them 15-25% a major depression. Accompanied cognitive deficits constitute the debated entity of pseudodementia or dementia syndrome of depression. This is a fuzzy field and the reversibility of the cognitive deficits is far from having been proved, 60-89% of tardive depression evolve toward dementia and only 5% of depressive state are identified as the first symptom of dementia or interpreted as changes in personality; no test or brain imaging technique can help in the diagnosis. Depression is the second most symptom in Alzheimer's disease and a common presenting symptom with a continuum between dysthymia (20-50%) and major depression (10-30%) and has even been interpreted as a factor for Alzheimer's disease. Apathy (50-80%), verbal aggressivity, agitation (40-60% ), emotional lability or abrupt changes in mood, irritability and violence are commonly associated with mood disorders in Alzheimer's disease. Anxiety is frequent (4%), but manic states or euphoria are exceptional. With the evolution of the disease, the prevalence of depression decreases. In Lewy body disease the prevalence of depression is the same as in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety is less frequent, violence is reported in 20%, psychomotor agitation in 60%. In fronto-temporal dementia changes in personality and social or instinctual behaviour are accompanied by some degree of depression (80% ), apathy (50-70%), disinhibition, insouciant euphoria (10-30%), loss of empathy or concern about the consequence of one's acts, blunting of affectivity, irritability or disorders of impulse control and sometimes manic states. In vascular dementia depression is more frequent than in Alzheimer's disease, apathy and mood fluctuations also. AIDS dementia is mostly apathetic or manic. Parkinsonism and dementia associate apathy and depression, anxiety and dysphoric states. In Huntington's chorea, disorders of impulse control, anxiety and severe depression with a risk of suicide 8-10 times higher than in the normal population are frequent in the beginning of the disease. Apathy is generally found in terminal stages of the disease. Multiple sclerosis with cognitive deficits, dementia due to sarcoidosis, Behcet's, Whipple's and Sjogren's diseases and idiopathic calcification of the basal ganglia are associated with depression, aggressivity, irritability and manic states. Occasionally, B 1 2 deficiency can present with depression or mania, hydrocephaly is commonly associated with depression and apathy. Wilson's disease is known to present with disorders of impulse control, depression, anxiety, emotional lability, aggressivity, apathy or manic states. Treatment of mood disorders in dementia generally responds to tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs or adrenergic selective antidepressants. Agitation is best treated with clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone, but the latter and classic neuroleptics may be harmful in Lewy body disease. Paradoxical reactions to sedatives are sometimes encountered, but diazepines and clomethiazole may be used.",

      "title": "Disease activity and stress are linked in a subpopulation of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients",
      "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by the development of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, with reoccurring symptoms for more than 6 weeks. CSU is often fluctuating and unpredictable in its course,1 which is a great burden to the patients, especially when no underlying causes are found. Psychosomatic and psychiatric comorbidities are often reported and an association between CSU and stress was proposed, in which psychosocial strain may initiate a vicious cycle of stress-induced worsening of the disease causing a higher psychosocial burden, which in turn amplifies the stress influence on the disease.2-5 At present, systematic studies in support of a stress- and disease-relationship in CSU are largely missing, rendering the stress-contribution to CSU unclear. Comprehensive studies of the association between stress and urticaria are needed to answers to the following questions: Do CSU patients report relevant stress levels? Are stress levels higher when no underlying cause can be identified (CSU‒ CSU+ patients)? Do CSU‒ patients suffer from higher disease activity compared to CSU+ patients? And finally, are stress levels in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients linked to disease activity? To address these knowledge gaps, we studied stress perception and resilience and their association with disease severity, assessed by use of the urticaria activity score (UAS7) in an explorative manner. In addition, selected routinely assessed immune outcomes that have been discussed to play a role in stress effects in urticaria (IgE, basophils, eosinophils) were studied. The exploratory study was approved by ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. A total of 303 CSU patients that provided informed written consent were assessed for mental distress, resilience, and immune outcomes (ELISA, complete blood count), and then, for potentially relevant underlying conditions, the results of which were disclosed to the patient after completion of the comprehensive workup of the etiologic tests by a team of experienced dermatologists (EMP, MM, MM). The scales \"worries,\" \"tension,\" \"and \"demands\" of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used to assess stress perception, \"joy\" and the Self-efficacy, Optimism and Pessimism (SWOP) questionnaire to assess resilience to stress.6, 7 PSQ \"summary score\" values above 50 are one SD (=17) higher, values below 16 are one SD lower than the mean (=33) in a German reference population,6 and were set as cutoffs for severe, medium and low stress, respectively. Additional data obtained included age, sex, body mass index, previous steroid- and anti-histamine intake. Investigated potentially relevant underlying clinical and laboratory conditions included autoreactivity, chronic viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, intolerance to food components, intolerance to physical provocation and chronic inflammatory diseases including autoimmune disorders and allergies. In 249 CSU patients, potentially relevant underlying conditions were identified (CSU+) as opposed to 54 patients without potentially relevant underlying conditions (CSU‒). Only a minority received oral medication prior to the assessment (antihistamines 20%, steroids 6%) and no medication or demographic differences were found between CSU+ and CSU‒ patients (Table S1). Levels of self-reported stress perception and resilience in CSU patients showed a wide range of mental distress levels, with low, moderate, and high PSQ scores in 21%, 64%, and 15% of patients, respectively. The mean PSQ \"summary score\" in women (32.05 ± 17.04, 72% of all patients) was slightly but not significantly higher than in men (29.82 ± 15.06). Patients younger than 45 years (55% of all patients) had slightly but not significantly higher PSQ \"summary score\" levels (33.12 ± 16.20) than older patients (29.55 ± 16.73). Chronic spontaneous urticaria‒ patients had significantly higher disease activity than CSU+ patients (Figure 1A). In CSU‒ patients, 52.6%, 31.6%, and 15.8% had UAS7 levels indicative of mild, moderate, and severe CSU, respectively, as compared to 64.2%, 25.8%, and 10% in CSU+ patients. CSU‒ patients reported higher PSQ \"worries,\" \"tension,\" and \"demands,\" with statistically increased values for the scale \"tension\" (Figure 1B,C, Table S2). In contrast, stress resilience in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients was similar. No group differences with respect to selected immunological measures such as total serum IgE, blood basophil and eosinophil counts were found (Table S3). Correlation analyses revealed that in CSU‒ patients, UAS7 scores showed a moderate positive correlation with the results of the PSQ-scales \"demands\" (r = .362; P = .028) and a trend for \"tension\" (r = .292; P = .0791) (Table 1). A regression analysis (including the confounders age, gender, and body mass index) confirmed these links in CSU‒ patients (adjusted R2 \"demands\" = 0.195; F(1/35) = 9.746; P = .004, Figure 1D; adjusted R2 \"tension\" = 0.082; F(1/35) = 4.218; P = .048, Figure 1E). The explained variance of 19.5% expresses a medium effect of f2 = 0.24 and of 8.2% a low effect of f2 = 0.09, respectively. By contrast, the common confounders age, gender, and body mass index were not significant predictors of the UAS7 in this group. Our comprehensive analyses of stress in patients with CSU are the first to demonstrate that most CSU patients report stress, but also that mean levels of mental distress are comparable to the general population.8 More importantly, our findings confirm that in CSU‒ perceived stress and disease activity are linked in the absence of demographic group differences and even before CSU‒ patients know that no underlying cause for their urticaria will be found. These observations are relevant and may help to destigmatize CSU patients, who often feel that their doctors and peers do not take their disease-burden seriously and attribute their suffering to the seemingly minor mental problem of having too much stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible causal link between CSU and mental distress and encourage further research to confirm whether the increased levels of stress in the CSU‒ subpopulation are the reason or the result of their high disease levels. Clearly, in some CSU patients, the signs and symptoms of urticaria and stress are linked, which confirms the need to assess both the clinical symptoms and stress, ideally by daily diary-assessments and during patient visits, and also to address both by therapy and research, for example by the implementation of psychological interventions.

      "abstract": "Introduction Antidepressant treatment, although it is effective to improve the manifestations of major depression, may also induce or exacerbate some symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Symptoms such as decreased libido, anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erection difficulty or dyspareunia, affect the quality of life of the subject who suffers and the self-esteem, can lead to lack of adherence to treatment and in accordingly, the relapse of depressive symptoms. Serotonergic antidepressants are frequently associated with the onset of sexual dysfunction in sexually active patients exceeding 70%. Clinicians underestimate the actual incidence of dysfunction as the technical specifications of drugs show lower levels than 25% and spontaneous reports of patients do not exceed 20-40%. Aims Vortioxetina is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and is also an agonist of the 5-HT1A partial agonist 5-HT1B and an antagonist of 5-HT3, 5-HT1D and 5-HT7. Apparently, this molecule at doses of between 5 and 15 mg is safe and effective and does not cause sexual dysfunction. It is a well-tolerated and safe, with low incidence of sexual dysfunction. Methods To evaluate the action we have evaluated sexual dysfunction in patients with major depression before receiving treatment vortioxetina (whether state or not previously treated with other antidepressants) and at 2, 6 and 12 months after starting treatment with the drug. So we’ve used the SALSex scale (Scale for measuring sexual dysfunction secondary to psychotropic drugs). Results The results of this study are still being analyzed.

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Differentiation of pathologic/neoplastic hypercortisolism (Cushing’s syndrome) from physiologic/non-neoplastic hypercortisolism (formerly known as pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome)",
      "abstract": "Endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) usually implies the presence of a pathologic condition caused by either an ACTH-secreting neoplasm or autonomous cortisol secretion from a benign or malignant adrenal neoplasm. However, sustained or intermittent hypercortisolism may also accompany many medical disorders that stimulate physiologic/non-neoplastic activation of the HPA axis (formerly known as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome); these two entities may share indistinguishable clinical and biochemical features. A thorough history and physical examination is often the best (and sometimes only) way to exclude pathologic/neoplastic hypercortisolism. The presence of alcoholism, renal failure, poorly controlled diabetes and severe neuropsychiatric disorders should always raise suspicion that the presence of hypercortisolism may be related to physiologic/non-neoplastic Cushing's syndrome. As late-night salivary cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression have good sensitivity and negative predictive value, normal studies exclude Cushing's syndrome of any form. However, these tests have imperfect specificity and additional testing over time with clinical follow-up is often needed. When there is persistent diagnostic uncertainty, secondary tests such as the DDAVP stimulation test and the dexamethasone-CRH test may provide evidence for the presence or absence of an ACTH-secreting tumor. This review will define and characterize the numerous causes of physiologic/non-neoplastic hypercortisolism and provide a rational clinical and biochemical approach to distinguish it from pathologic/neoplastic hypercortisolism (true Cushing's syndrome).",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features; cardiovascular disease (dilation of the ascending aorta in 46%); neurologic abnormalities (hypotonia, adventitious movements, and abnormal gait and station); speech sound disorders including motor speech disorders (childhood apraxia of speech and/or dysarthria) and phonologic disorders; behavior problems including anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety disorder [social phobia]), selective mutism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional disorders, physical aggression, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD); delayed motor, speech, and social skills in early childhood; and intellectual ability ranging from intellectual disability (~18%) to borderline intellectual ability (~20%) to low average to high average (the remainder). Approximately 30% of individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). Management Treatment of manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until age six years. Genetic counseling The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent. When a parent has the 7q11.23 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the duplication is 50%. If the 7q11.23 duplication identified in the proband is not identified in the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

      "abstract": "Abstract Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two‐thirds of patients. Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to affected status in SCA. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society",

In Poland, disability after stroke, affects 70% of patients and is definitely higher than in the other developed countries. Information that stroke affects young, sexually active persons is becoming more and more common, however this aspect of patients' functionality falls into the background, both for patients and specialists, as it seems to be less important than other disorders. These patients report the decrease of all sexual functions such as libido, erectile function, orgasm, vaginal lubrication and sexual satisfaction; the frequency of intercourse decreases significantly. The sexual dysfunction in these patients depends on many factors. Among them, we can distinguish between the extent of the focus of the stroke, the method of treatment and the level of general post-stroke disability. Some of the sexual disfunctions are temporary in the initial period they result mainly neurological deficit (aphasia, movement disorders, paresis, limbs paralysis) later on, psychological factors may start playing a significant role. These disturbances also show some dynamics over time. The etiology of sexual disorders after stroke is multi-functional. There are organic factors and also psychosocial and psychological. Among psychological factors, depression, anxiety and fear that the stroke can come back can lead to the decrease of one's sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction in patients after a stroke may be associated with a malfunction of the genitourinary system, including urinary incontinence.

Both major clinical elements, the productive symptoms and the signs of deficit, seem in part to be reactive to the degree of stimulation in the psychosocial environment, though such factors by no means explain all their variability. The negative impairment tends to antedate florid onset and is a better predictor of social outcome than the florid symptoms. There is, however, no firm evidence that deterioration (deficit inevitably increasing with time) occurs. Manfred Bleuler's formulation summarises the overall outcome of a substantial part of what most clinicians who do not include a chronic course as part of the diagnosis call schizophrenia. About 20–25% recover, about 20–25% remain severely impaired throughout, the remainder run a fluctuating course.",

In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction in Uremia",
      "abstract": "Disturbances in sexual function are a common feature of chronic renal failure. Approximately 50% of uremic men complain of erectile dysfunction while an even greater percentage of both men and women complain of decreased libido and a marked decline in the frequency of intercourse (1,2). The genesis of sexual dysfunction is multifactorial and is primarily organic in origin. In addition to the uremic milieu, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, and pharmacologic therapy all play an important role in the genesis of this problem. In addition, psychologic and physical stresses are also commonly present in this setting. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men In men with chronic renal failure, disturbances in the pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected with only moderate reductions in the GFR and progressively worsen as the renal failure progresses. These disorders rarely normalize with initiation of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and, in fact, often progress. By comparison, a well-functioning renal transplant is much more likely to restore normal sexual activity, although some features of reproductive function may remain impaired (3). Testicular Function Chronic renal failure is associated with impaired spermatogenesis and testicular damage, often leading to infertility (4). Semen analysis typically shows a decreased volume of ejaculate, either low or complete azoospermia, and a low percentage of motility. These abnormalities are often apparent before the need for dialysis and then deteriorate further once dialytic therapy is initiated. Histologic changes in the testes include evidence of decreased spermatogenic activity with the greatest changes in the hormonally dependent later stages of spermatogenesis. The number of spermatocytes is reduced and there is little evidence of maturation to the stage of mature sperm. In most instances, the number of spermatogonia is normal but on occasion complete aplasia of germinal elements may also be present. Other findings include damage to the seminiferous tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and calcifications. Unlike other causes of severe primary testicular lesions, the Leydig and Sertoli cells show little evidence of hypertrophy or hyperplasia. This later finding suggests a defect in the hormonal regulation of the Leydig and Sertoli cells as might occur with either gonadotropin deficiency or resistance, rather than a cytotoxic effect of uremia where spermatogonia would be most affected (5). The factors responsible for testicular damage in uremia are not well understood. It is possible that plasticizers in dialysis tubing, such as phthalate, may play a role in propagating the abnormalities once patients begin maintenance hemodialysis. Sex Steroids In addition to impaired spermatogenesis, the testes also show evidence of impaired endocrine function. Total and free testosterone levels are typically reduced, although the binding capacity and concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin are normal (6,7,8). Acute stimulation of testosterone secretion with administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a compound with luteinizing hormone-like actions, produces only a blunted response in uremic men (9). Lower free testosterone levels and impaired Leydig cell sensitivity to HCG are first detectable with only moderate reductions in the GFR and before basal levels of testosterone fall. Recent studies have shown evidence of a factor in uremic serum capable of blocking the luteinizing hormone receptor, thus providing an explanation for the sluggish response of the Leydig cell to infusion of HCG (10). This blocking activity is inversely correlated with GFR and largely disappears after transplantation. Compared with testosterone, the total plasma estrogen concentration is often elevated in advanced renal failure (8). However, the physiologically important estradiol levels are typically in the normal range. As with the lack of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Leydig cells, normal levels of estradiol suggest a functional gonadotropin deficiency or resistance in uremia because increased luteinizing hormone levels should enhance the testicular secretion of estradiol (5). Hypothalamic-Pituitary Function The plasma concentration of the pituitary gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH), is elevated in uremic men (8). Elevated levels are found early in renal insufficiency and progressively rise with deteriorating renal function. The excess LH secretion in this setting is thought to result from the diminished release of testosterone from the Leydig cells, since testosterone normally leads to feedback inhibition of LH release. In addition, the metabolic clearance rate of LH is reduced as a result of decreased renal clearance. The increase in serum LH is variable and modest when compared to that observed in castrate nonuremic subjects. The lack of a more robust response of LH to low levels of circulating testosterone suggests a derangement in the central regulation of gonadotropin release. Infusion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) increases LH levels to the same degree as in healthy subjects; however, the peak value and return to baseline may be delayed (11,12). Since the kidney contributes importantly to the clearance of GnRH and LH, decreased metabolism of these hormones may explain the observed variations. The abnormal LH response to GnRH precedes and is not corrected by dialytic therapy. By contrast, renal transplantation returns the response of gonadotropins back to normal. In addition to decreased metabolism, subtle disturbances in LH secretion have also been described. Under normal circumstances, LH is secreted in a pulsatile manner. In uremic subjects, the number of secretory bursts remains normal but the amount of LH released per secretory burst is reduced (13). It is not known whether this decrease in amplitude is the result of a change in the pattern of GnRH release from the hypothalamus or a change in the responsiveness of the pituitary. In either case, the secretory pattern of LH returns to normal with the placement of a well-functioning allograft. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also increased in men with chronic renal failure, although to a more variable degree such that the LH/FSH ratio is typically increased. FSH release by the pituitary normally responds to feedback inhibition by a peptide product of the Sertoli cells called inhibin. The plasma FSH concentration tends to be highest in those uremic patients with the most severe damage to seminiferous tubules and presumably the lowest levels of inhibin. It has been suggested that increased FSH levels may portend a poor prognosis for recovery of spermatogenic function after renal transplantation (4,14). Clomiphene is a compound that acts by competing with estrogen or testosterone for receptors at the level of the hypothalamus and prevents the negative feedback of gonadal steroids on the release of GnRH and subsequently the release of pituitary gonadotropins. When administered to chronic renal failure patients, there is an appropriate rise in the levels of both LH and FSH, suggesting that the negative feedback control of testosterone on the hypothalamus is intact and that the storage and release of gonadotropins by the pituitary is normal (8). In summary, a number of observations suggest that gonadal failure is an important consequence of chronic renal failure. The finding that LH levels are typically increased is consistent with the presence of testicular damage. However, the lack of Leydig cell hypertrophy and normal estradiol levels also raise the possibility of functional hypogonadism. The finding that LH levels are only modestly increased in chronic renal failure suggests a diminished response of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to lowered testosterone levels and impaired regulation of gonadotropin secretion. One explanation for the blunted rise in LH in response to low levels of testosterone is that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in chronic renal failure is reset in such a way that it is more sensitive to the negative feedback inhibition of testosterone. In this manner, the axis begins to assume a similar characteristic as seen in the prepubertal state where there is extreme sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of gonadal steroids (5). Prolactin Metabolism Elevated plasma prolactin levels are commonly found in dialyzed men (15). Increased production is primarily responsible, since the kidney plays little, if any, role in the catabolism of this hormone. Prolactin release is normally under dopaminergic inhibitory control. Its secretion in chronic renal failure, however, appears autonomous and resistant to stimulatory or suppressive maneuvers. As an example, dopamine infusion or the administration of oral L-dopa fails to decrease basal prolactin levels. On the other hand, procedures that normally increase prolactin secretion such as arginine infusion, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or thyrotropin-releasing hormone infusion elicit no response or only a blunted response. Again, these abnormalities resolve after a successful renal transplant. Increased prolactin secretion in chronic renal failure may be related in part to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. An infusion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in healthy men enhances prolactin release, a response that can be suppressed by the administration of L-dopa (16). Furthermore, partial inhibition of PTH release by the administration of calcitriol led in one study to an elevation in plasma testosterone levels, a reduction in plasma gonadotropin concentrations, and improved sexual function (17). However, this benefit could not be confirmed in a controlled trial of calcitriol therapy (18). Depletion of total body zinc stores may also play an etiologic role in uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). The clinical significance of enhanced prolactin release in uremic men is incompletely understood. Extreme hyperprolactinemia is associated with infertility, loss of libido, low circulating testosterone levels, and inappropriately low LH levels in men with normal renal function. These observations led to the evaluation of therapy with bromocryptine, which reduces prolactin secretion. Although it can lower prolactin levels to near normal in men with advanced renal disease, there has been an inconsistent effect on sexual potency and libido (15). In addition, a high incidence of side effects may be seen, particularly hypotension. Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occurs in approximately 30% of men on maintenance hemodialysis. This problem most often develops during the initial months of dialysis and then tends to regress as dialysis continues. The pathogenesis of gynecomastia in this setting is unclear. Although elevated prolactin levels and an increased estrogen-to-androgen ratio seem attractive possibilities, most data fail to support a primary role for abnormal hormonal function. Alternatively, a mechanism similar to that responsible for gynecomastia following refeeding of malnourished patients may be involved. Evaluation of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men Sexual dysfunction can be manifest in several ways in uremic men. Perhaps the most common complaint the physician must address is that of impotence (Table 1). In evaluating and ultimately treating the impotent renal failure patient, one must not only consider disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis discussed above, but also abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system and derangements in the arterial supply or venous drainage of the penis. In addition, the psychologic effects of a chronic illness and lifestyle limitations may have a negative impact on sexual function.Table 1: Factors involved in the pathogenesis of impotence in uremic menaA through history and physical can provide useful information during the initial evaluation of a patient with impotence. A history of normal erectile function before the development of renal failure suggests a secondary cause of impotence. Symptoms or physical findings of a neuropathy as in a patient with a neurogenic bladder would indicate a neurologic etiology. Similarly, symptoms or signs of peripheral vascular disease may be a clue to the presence of vascular obstruction to penile blood flow. One should look for the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial, axillary, and pubic hair. The lack of these findings and the presence of small soft testicles suggest primary or secondary hypogonadism as the cause of the impotence. Neurogenic and vascular causes are more likely to be associated with normalsized testicles. Even when the history and physical point to a specific abnormality, one must also consider that an individual patient may have more than one factor responsible for the erectile dysfunction and other causes may need to be ultimately evaluated. A review of the patient's medications may reveal a drug that could be responsible for impairing sexual function. Antihypertensive medications are common offenders, with centrally acting agents and beta blockers being the most commonly implicated agents in causing impotence. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are associated with a lower incidence of impotence and represent a useful alternative in renal failure patients with hypertension. Other drugs commonly implicated include cimetidine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and metoclopramide. If the history and physical examination reveal no obvious cause, then a psychologic cause of erectile dysfunction may need to be considered. Testing for the presence of nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) has been done in some centers as a means to discriminate between a psychologic and organic cause of impotence. The basis for this test is that during the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, males normally have an erection. The assumption is that a man with a psychologic cause of impotence would still experience erections while asleep, whereas the absence of an adequate erection would make an organic cause more likely. If a patient is found to have nocturnal erections, then psychologic testing and evaluation is indicated. It should be noted that NPT testing is not infallible and that if a patient has a normal test and no psychologic cause is found then evaluation for an organic cause should still be pursued. Primary depression may affect sexual function and lead to reduced libido and decreased frequency of intercourse. As a result, it has been suggested that depression may play a role in the genesis of sexual dysfunction in chronic renal failure patients. Studies addressing this issue have produced conflicting results. Procci et al. found no association between the presence or absence of depression and measures of sexual function such as frequency of intercourse or ability to develop an erection as determined by NPT testing (1). In a more recent study, Steele et al. surveyed a randomly selected group of 68 peritoneal dialysis patients that included both men and women and found that 63% of patients reported never having intercourse, 19% had intercourse less than or equal to two times per month, and 18% had intercourse more than two times per month (20). In this study, standard psychologic questionnaires indicated that the patients who never had intercourse were more depressed and anxious, and assessed their overall quality of life at a level that was significantly lower than that of the other two groups. Thus, subclinical depression may be underrated as a contributory cause of sexual dysfunction in both uremic men and women. It is also likely that mental symptoms of fatigue and listlessness associated with the treatment of end-stage renal disease are also major factors in this problem (2). There are tests that may aid in the discrimination between a neurogenic and a vascular cause of impotence. Tests performed to exclude a vascular etiology of impotence include Doppler studies to measure penile blood flow, measurement of penile BP, and penile pulse palpation. Neurogenic impotence is suggested by detecting a prolonged latency time of the bulbocavernous reflex or confirming the presence of a neurogenic bladder. With the availability of sildenafil (see below) to use in a therapeutic trial, such tests are generally reserved for nonresponders who may eventually be considered for surgical placement of a penile prosthesis. As discussed previously, hormonal abnormalities are frequently detected in chronic renal failure patients. Endocrine tests that are useful in the evaluation of an organic cause of impotence include measurement of serum LH, FSH, testosterone, and prolactin levels. It should be noted that only a small percentage of uremic patients will have prolactin levels >100 ng/ml. Imaging studies of the hypothalamic-pituitary region should be performed in patients with levels of greater magnitude to exclude the presence of a microadenoma or macroadenoma. Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men The treatment of sexual dysfunction in uremic men is initially of a general nature (Figure 1). One needs to ensure optimal delivery of dialysis and adequate nutritional intake. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin has been shown to enhance sexual function in chronic renal failure. It is likely that the associated improvement in well-being that comes with the correction of anemia probably plays an important role in this response. In some studies, erythropoietin therapy has been reported to cause normalization of the pituitary gonadal feedback mechanism with reduced plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and increases in plasma testosterone levels (21,22). Reductions in elevated plasma prolactin levels have also been noted (23). It is controversial as to whether these endocrinologic changes are solely the result of correction of the anemia or a direct effect of erythropoietin. As mentioned previously, controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D may be of benefit in lowering prolactin levels and improving sexual function in some patients.Figure 1.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic men.Patients with normal NPT testing should be evaluated to determine whether there is a psychologic component to the impotence. If a problem is found then a trial of psychotherapy is warranted. The effectiveness of antidepressant medications and/or psychiatric counseling in chronic renal failure patients with sexual dysfunction has not been well studied. In patients with a neurogenic or vascular cause of impotence, therapeutic options include intracavernous injection of alprostadil (synthetic PGE1), use of vacuum/constriction devices, or urethral suppositories containing alprostadil. Surgical placement of a penile prosthesis is typically considered in patients who fail the less invasive first-line treatments. With the recent approval of sildenafil for the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, many physicians now utilize this agent as the first-line therapy for patients with psychogenic, vascular, or neurogenic causes of impotence. There have been no published studies to date specifically addressing the effectiveness and safety of sildenafil in chronic renal failure patients. However, anecdotally the drug appears effective in such patients. Since the majority of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the United States are diabetic, it is noteworthy that a recently published randomized controlled trial found that sildenafil was both effective and well tolerated in diabetic men with erectile dysfunction (24). More than 95% of the patients in this study were believed to have either a neurogenic or vascular etiology of erectile dysfunction. Whether diabetic patients with renal disease will experience a similar benefit is not known. It should be emphasized that sildinafil is contraindicated in patients who are currently taking organic nitrates. Caution should also be exercised when prescribing this agent to patients with known coronary artery disease. In patients with low circulating levels of testosterone, correcting the deficit generally results in clinical improvement in other forms of gonadal failure. By contrast, administration of testosterone to uremic men usually fails to restore libido or potency, despite increased testosterone levels and reduced release of LH and FSH (25,26). In a recent report of 27 male dialysis patients with biochemically proven hypogonadism, administration of depot testosterone fully restored sexual function in only three patients (27). In those patients unresponsive to medical therapy, use of a vacuum tumescence device completely corrected penile erection dysfunction in the majority of cases. In a hypogonadal patient whose primary complaint is decreased libido, a trial of testosterone may be warranted. In very limited studies, administration of clomiphene citrate has also been reported to cause a normalization of plasma testosterone levels associated with some improvement in sexual function. Patients found to have increased circulating levels of prolactin may benefit from a trial of bromocryptine. This agent is a dopaminergic agonist that has shown some efficacy in improving sexual function presumably by reducing elevated prolactin levels. However, its usefulness has been limited by a relatively high frequency of side effects. Other dopaminergic agonists, such as parlodel and lisuride, seem to be better tolerated but have only been used in small short-term studies. Zinc deficiency has also been suggested as a cause of gonadal failure. Uremic patients are often deficient in zinc, probably due to reduced dietary intake, zinc malabsorption, and/or possible leaching of zinc by dialysis equipment. In a controlled trial, supplemental zinc resulted in significant increases in the plasma testosterone concentration and sperm counts, as well as significant declines in LH and FSH levels compared with a control group (28). Potency, libido, and frequency of inter-course also improved in those patients given zinc. It is possible that normalization of total body zinc may also be effective in correcting uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). Thus, the aggregate data suggest that the administration of zinc in a zinc-deficient man is a reasonable therapeutic option. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Women Disturbances in menstruation and fertility are commonly encountered in women with chronic renal failure, usually leading to amenorrhea by the time the patient reaches end-stage renal disease. The menstrual cycle typically remains irregular with scanty flow after the initiation of maintenance dialysis, although normal menses is restored in some women (29). In others, hypermenorrhagia develops, potentially leading to significant blood loss and increased transfusion requirements. The major menstrual abnormality in uremic women is anovulation, with affected patients being infertile (30). Women on chronic dialysis also tend to complain of decreased libido and reduced ability to reach orgasm (2,20). Pregnancy can rarely occur in advanced renal failure, but fetal wastage is markedly increased. Some residual renal function is usually present in the infrequent pregnancy that can be carried to term. The subject of pregnancy in chronic renal insufficiency has recently been reviewed (31). Normal Menstrual Cycle The normal menstrual cycle is divided into a follicular or proliferative phase and a luteal or secretory phase. Normal follicular maturation and subsequent ovulation require appropriately timed secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. FSH secretion exhibits typical negative feedback, with hormone levels falling as the plasma estrogen concentration rises. In contrast, LH secretion is suppressed maximally by low concentrations of estrogen but exhibits positive feedback control in response to a rising and sustained elevation of estradiol. Thus, high levels of estradiol in the late follicular phase trigger a surging elevation in LH secretion, which is responsible for ovulation. After ovulation, progesterone levels increase due to production by the corpus luteum. Progesterone is responsible for the transformation of the endometrium into the luteal phase. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Premenopausal Women Indirect determination of ovulation suggests that anovulatory cycles are the rule in uremic women (32). For example, endometrial biopsies show an absence of progestational effects, and there is a failure to increase basal body temperature at the time when ovulation would be expected. In addition, the preovulatory peak in LH and estradiol concentrations is frequently absent. The failure of LH to rise in part reflects a disturbance in the positive estradiol feedback pathway, since the administration of exogenous estrogen to mimic the preovulatory surge in estradiol fails to stimulate LH release (32). In contrast, feedback inhibition of gonadotropin release by low doses of estradiol remains intact. This can be illustrated by the ability of the antiestrogen clomiphene to enhance LH and FSH secretion. It remains unclear whether the disturbances in cyclic gonadotropin production originate in the hypothalamus (via impaired production of GnRH) or in the anterior pituitary (30). It is possible, for example, that endorphins are involved. Circulating endorphin levels are increased in chronic renal failure due primarily to reduced renal opioid clearance, and endorphins can inhibit ovulation, perhaps by reducing the release of GnRH. Prolactin and Galactorrhea Women with chronic renal failure commonly have elevated circulating prolactin levels. As in men with chronic renal failure, the hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be autonomous, as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release. It has been suggested that the elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary function and contribute to sexual dysfunction and galactorrhea in these patients. It is of interest in this regard that nonuremic women with prolactin-producing pituitary tumors commonly present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and low circulating gonadotropin levels. However, uremic women treated with bromocryptine rarely resume normal menses and continue to complain of galactorrhea (if present), despite normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration (32). Thus, factors other than hyperprolactinemia must be important in this setting. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Postmenopausal Women Postmenopausal uremic women have gonadotropin levels as high as those seen in nonuremic women of similar age (32,33). This observation is consistent with the finding mentioned above in premenopausal women that negative feedback inhibition of estrogen on LH and FSH release is intact in uremia. However, the age at which menopause begins in chronic renal failure tends to be decreased when compared to healthy women. Treatment The high frequency of anovulation leads sequentially to lack of formation of the corpus luteum and failure of progesterone secretion. Because progesterone is responsible for transforming the endometrium into the luteal phase, lack of progesterone is associated with amenorrhea. For patients who desire to resume menses, administration of a progestational agent during the final days of the monthly cycle will usually be successful. On the other hand, ongoing menses can contribute significantly to the anemia of chronic renal disease, particularly in those patients with hypermenorrhagia. In this setting, administration of a progestational agent during the entire monthly cycle will terminate menstrual flow. Rarely, a patient may require hysterectomy for refractory uterine bleeding. It is not known whether the usual absence of menses in women with chronic renal failure predisposes to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and possible carcinoma. Since these patients are often anovulatory, there is no disruption of the proliferative effect of estrogen by the release of progesterone. It is therefore recommended that women with chronic renal failure be monitored closely by a gynecologist; it may be desirable in at least some patients to administer a progestational agent several times per year to interrupt the proliferation induced by unopposed estrogen release (Figure 2).Figure 2.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic women.Although pregnancy can rarely occur in women on chronic dialysis, restoration of fertility as a therapeutic goal should be discouraged. In comparison, the abnormalities in ovulation can usually be reversed and successful pregnancy achieved in women with a well-functioning renal transplant. Uremic women who are menstruating normally should be encouraged to use birth control. Studies addressing the therapy of decreased libido and sexual function in uremic women are lacking. Amenorrheic hemodialysis patients may have low estradiol levels that can secondarily lead to vaginal atrophy and dryness and result in discomfort during intercourse. Such patients may benefit from local estrogen therapy or vaginal lubricants. Low dose testosterone may be effective in increasing sexual desire but is rarely used secondary to potential toxicity. Bromocryptine therapy in hyperprolactinemic patients may help in restoring sexual function but has not been well studied. Estrogen supplementation may improve sexual function in those patients with low circulating estradiol levels. Successful transplantation is clearly the most effective means to restore normal sexual desire in women with chronic renal failure (2). Summary In summary, sexual dysfunction is a common finding in both men and women with chronic renal failure. Common disturbances include erectile dysfunction in men, menstrual abnormalities in women, and decreased libido and fertility in both sexes. These abnormalities are primarily organic in nature and are related to uremia as well as the other comorbid conditions that frequently accompany the chronic renal failure patient. Fatigue and psychosocial factors related to the presence of a chronic disease are also contributory factors. Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected before the need for dialysis but continue to worsen once dialytic therapy is initiated. Impaired gonadal function is prominent in uremic men, whereas the disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are more subtle. By contrast, central disturbances are more prominent in uremic women. Therapy is initially directed toward optimizing the delivery of dialysis, correcting anemia with recombinant erythropoietin, and controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D. For many practicing nephrologists, sildenafil has become the first-line therapy in the treatment of impotence. In the hypogonadal man whose only complaint is decreased libido, testosterone may be of benefit. Regular gynecologic follow-up is required in uremic women to guard against potential complications of unopposed estrogen effect. Uremic women should be advised against pregnancy while on dialysis. Successful transplantation is the most effective means of restoring normal sexual function in both men and women with chronic renal failure.",

If the child responds “yes” to Question 1a and “no” to Question 1b (child reports depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the child responds “yes” to any part of Question 12, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child’s current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventive action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "title": "Depressione post-partum: valutazione clinica e medico-legale",
      "abstract": "Piu dell’85% delle donne nel post-partum soffrono di disturbi dell’umore: nella maggior parte dei casi forme transitorie e lievi (“postpartum blues”), nel 15% forme piu severe (“depressione propriamente detta”) che possono sfociare in “psicosi”. Il caso da noi riportato riguarda una donna di 21 anni che, dopo aver partorito con taglio cesareo per ipossia acuta fetale, in 7a giornata di puerperio riferisce che “c’e qualcosa che non va”: si dimostra particolarmente stanca, irritata, triste. Nei giorni successivi la sintomatologia si acuisce. Alla consulenza psichiatrica le viene diagnosticata “depressione post-partum moderata” e dopo una terapia per 6 mesi con paroxetina la prognosi e stata buona sia per la madre che per il neonato. I disturbi psichiatrici del post-partum rappresentano un importante problema di sanita pubblica, che puo anche avere conseguenze negative sullo sviluppo fisico e comportamentale, oltre che poter mettere a rischio la vita del neonato (“infanticidio”). Le varie legislazioni europee infliggono una pena minore nei casi di infanticidio, e in Italia la legge che lo regolamenta e l’art. 578 del c.p., riformulato dalla legge n. 42 del 5/8/1981: “La madre che cagiona la morte del proprio neonato immediatamente dopo il parto, o del feto durante il parto, quando il fatto e determinato da condizioni di abbandono materiale e morale connessa al parto, e punita con la reclusione da 4 a 12 anni”. Data quindi la potenziale gravita di questo disturbo, e importante diagnosticarlo in fase precoce ed attuare delle misure terapeutiche appropriate, oltre che supporto psicologico.",

      "abstract": "Emotional dysregulation is considered as a core feature of borderline personality disorders. Emotional dysregulation can express itself both as emotional instability (i.e. an inability to modulate affects than can become uncontrolled) or in terms of poor emotional awareness (i.e. emotional numbing, alexithymic features). Whereas the first dimension is closely related to symptoms, such as impulsivity, suicidal behaviours or inappropriate anger, the latter can be associated with dissociative experiences and chronic feeling of emptiness. Although both dimensions have been related to negative experiences during childhood, however, little is known about the specific developmental pathways leading to emotional instability or emotional awareness in borderline adolescents. In this presentation, we will show some data concerning the specific traumatic pathways observed in a sample of borderline adolescents issued from the European Network on borderline personality disorders.",

Many clinicians question the advisability of treating a persistent primary amenorrhea since the establishment of autonomous function cannot readily be expected with the available means of therapy (1–4). It is noteworthy that cases of this type are seriously handicapped both psychologically and sociologically. There is a persistent request and need for any treatment, regardless of its limitations, which might enable these patients to cope with their handicaps. Cyclical uterine bleeding or menstruation can be induced in any type of functional amenorrhea with adequate dosage of estrogens and progestogens (5–9). Such therapy, while only substitutional, is usually ac’ companied by changes in the psychological status and secondary sex characteristics which are of the utmost importance.",

The present factor analytic study examines 35 distinct depressive symptoms in three depressed samples and supports the conceptualization of D. F. Klein (Endomorphic depression. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 31: 447–454, 1974) that endogeneity and reactivity can be construed as orthogonal, independent dimensions. Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2) showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsibilities; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at \"end of rope\"; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity.

      "title": "Male Depression – Are gender-related personality traits associated with the severity of depressive symptoms?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Higher prevalence &amp; incidence rates of depressive disorder in women compared with men are among the recurring findings from epidemiologic &amp; clinical studies. The literature suggests that this is not due to a lower need for treatment of depression in men. In the context of the concept ‘male depression’ (MD), it is often argued that men tend to have so called ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms. These symptoms (such as aggressiveness, irritability, alcohol use, risk-taking &amp; antisocial behavior) are rarely considered in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, which may lead to underdiagnosis. With regard to the occurrence of ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms and the concept MD, the importance of masculine personality traits is often discussed. The topic of the session is the extent to which gender-related personality traits such as masculine, feminine, androgynous &amp; undifferentiated are associated with the occurrence and severity of ‘non-typical’ and ‘typical’ depressive symptoms in women and men with a depressive disorder. Objectives The results of a study in a clinical setting will be presented. The aim of the study was to investigate whether above mentioned gender-related personality traits are associated with increased severity of depressive symptoms and whether there are differences between women &amp; men. Methods Depressive symptoms (GMDS &amp; BDI II) and gender-related personality traits (GEPAQ) were assessed in female &amp; male patients (≥ 18 years) with an unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). Participants were recruited from inpatient settings &amp; day clinics of specialized psychiatric-psychotherapeutic hospitals in Germany. The multicenter study with a cross-sectional design has been completed. Data from the clinical sample were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results Multiple linear regression analysis: criteria variable GMDS &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ ( masculine pt) b-coefficient women = -1.36 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = -1.48 (p ≤ .01); criteria variable GMDS &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ (feminin pt) b-coefficient women = .12 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = .79 (n.s.); criteria variable BDI II &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ ( masculine pt) b-coefficient women = -1.72 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = -4.23 (p ≤ .01); criteria variable BDI II &amp; predicting variable GEPAQ (feminin pt) b-coefficient women = .95 (n.s.) &amp; b-coefficient men = .-24 (n.s.) Conclusions Gender-related personality traits are associated with the occurrence and severity of ‘non-typical’ &amp; ‘typical’ depressive symptoms. They should be considered in the diagnosis &amp; treatment of depression. Gender differences have also been identified. In men, the expression of masculine personality traits does not lead to an increase in depressive symptoms, especially not in ‘non-typical’ depressive symptoms, as was originally thought. Based on these and other recent findings, the concept of MD can be critically discussed. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Cenesthopathy is a syndrome where patients persistently complain of abnormal sensations in some particular parts of their body, giving them odd descriptions, with the sensations being medically unexplainable. It is also often chronic and refractory to treatment It is commonly divided into two types: one is defined in a narrow sense, with only an abnormal sensation of the body as the main symptom, and the other in a wider sense, where the sensation is a syndrome accompanying schizophrenia, depression, or organic psychiatric disorder. The nosological evaluation of cenesthopathy has not been established. We report two pre-senile female patients with cenesthopathy under agitated conditions continuing for years, with a diagnosis of depression, and they were resolved with lithium carbonate administered for a manic or mixed state exhibited later. There have been few reports on cenesthopathy accompanying a manic or mixed state, or the effect of lithium carbonate on such a condition. Our cases showed that a manic factor or mixed state plays an important role in agitated symptoms often observed in pre-senile and senile depression. We propose that the hypochondriacal state involving cenesthopathy may be strongly associated with a manic factor, as has been psychopathologically discussed in foreign and domestic literature, including studies of Ey, H. and Leonhard, K. Although cenesthopathy has been mainly treated with antidepressants and antipsychotics, considering the weight of a manic factor and mixed state, mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate at an adequate dosage may prove to be effective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic pain syndromes are often treatment refractory and pose an enormous burden of suffering for the individual. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is generally defined as noncyclic pain of at least 6 months duration and severe enough to require medical care or cause disability. CPP has been estimated to have a prevalence of 15% among women of reproductive age. Women are at increased risk for both major depression and chronic pain syndromes such as CPP, and are more likely to report antecedent stressful events, have higher rates of physical and sexual abuse, and subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder. High rates of sexual and physical abuse and other trauma have been shown among women with CPP, including symptoms of dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation), and vulvar pain. A detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the patient with CPP should include a thorough gynecologic exam and a full mental health assessment. Treatment of CPP must include an integrated approach targeted at both the psychiatric comorbidity and pain symptoms. A multidisciplinary treatment team offers the best chance for success with CPP, and it is critical to suggest psychiatric treatment (psychopharmacology and/or psychotherapy) in addition to traditional medical and surgical approaches.",

When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

      "title": "PROGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "On the basis of a critical survey of the literature, the following conclusions are drawn concerning the significance of the various criteria of prognosis in schizophrenia: The prognosis is most favorable when the duration of illness is short; the type of onset acute; exogenic precipitating factors, obvious; the element of confusion and the presence of atypical symptoms (especially manic-depressive symptoms), prominent in the early symptomatology; and when process symptoms are minimal or absent. Conversely, when these conditions are reversed, the prognosis is least favorable. This group of criteria is of the greatest import in the assessment of prognosis in schizophrenia. Certain other factors seem to have some significance, although their relative prognostic importance cannot be clearly evaluated at the present time. Patients with a history of a previous episode of illness appear to have a better chance of remission; the more so, the longer the interval of time between attacks, the more complete the recovery during the preceding remission, and the greater the dissimilarity between the present and previous episodes. The incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in the hereditary background may be related to the development of atypical symptoms and thus favorably influence the outcome of the illness. From a prognostic point of view, asthenic body type is unfavorable, pyknic favorable; due to possible technical error, caution is required in classification of body-type. Extravert temperament and adequate pre-psychotic life-adjustment offer a more favorable outlook, in contrast to introversion and inadequacy of reaction to life situations. However, it should be noted that evaluation of these factors on the basis of information obtained from relatives and friends is only approximate. In general, the catatonic subtype offers the best prognosis and paranoids the worst, with simple and hebephrenic subtypes in an intermediate position. Acute cases which are so atypical as not to allow classification under any of these four subtypes, are especially favorable prognostically. A progressive hospital course is ominous, whereas improvement or fluctuation is indicative of a more favorable outcome. Male or female sex, education and abilities, and psycho-sexual history seem to have no prognostic significance. Likewise the factor of age at onset of illness does not contribute to the assessment of outcome, except that relatively late age offers an unfavorable prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Sexual function and to a lesser extent reproduction are often disrupted in women with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who must be educated to better understand their sexual and reproductive health. Women with SCI are sexually active; they can use psychogenic or reflexogenic stimulation to obtain sexual pleasure and orgasm. Treatment should consider a holistic approach using autonomic standards to describe remaining sexual function and to assess both genital function and psychosocial factors. Assessment of genital function should include thoracolumbar dermatomes, vulvar sensitivity (touch, pressure, vibration), and sacral reflexes. Self-exploration should include not only clitoral stimulation, but also stimulation of the vagina (G spot), cervix, and nipples conveyed by different innervation sources. Treatments may consider PDE5 inhibitors and flibanserin on an individual basis, and secondary consequences of SCI should address concerns with spasticity, pain, incontinence, and side effects of medications. Psychosocial issues must be addressed as possible contributors to sexual dysfunctions (eg, lower self-esteem, past sexual history, depression, dating habits). Pregnancy is possible for women with SCI; younger age at the time of injury and at the time of pregnancy being significant predictors of successful pregnancy, along with marital status, motor score, mobility, and occupational scores. Pregnancy may decrease the level of functioning (eg, self-care, ambulation, upper-extremity tasks), may involve complications (eg, decubitus ulcers, weight gain, urological complications), and must be monitored for postural hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Taking into consideration the physical and psychosocial determinants of sexuality and childbearing allows women with SCI to achieve positive sexual and reproductive health.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

La identificación del duelo complicado es central para poder ofrecer tratamientos adecuados. Sin embargo, no se conoce con claridad el perfil sintomatológico, ni la influencia que tienen el tipo de pérdida en la intensidad del duelo. En este estudio descriptivo participaron un total de 68 personas que habían sufrido una pérdida, al menos seis meses antes de la evaluación.

Los resultados señalan que todas las variables psicopatológicas mostraron altas relaciones significativas con la intensidad de síntomas de duelo. La centralidad con que se percibió la pérdida y los sentimientos de hostilidad predijeron en gran medida los valores de duelo complicado y con mayor intensidad de experiencias de duelo y de síntomas psicopatológicos. El perfil sintomatológico en duelo complicado se relaciona con un gran abanico de psicopatología. La pérdida de un hijo parece ser un importante factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de duelo complicado. The loss of a loved one may provoke complicated grief, which is characterized by intense symptoms of yearning, sadness, or loss of life meaning. Identifying those at risk of developing complicated grief is crucial to provide adequate treatment. However, little is known about the symptom profile or the influence that the type of loss may have on grief intensity. A descriptive design was carried out. A total of 68 participants that have lost a loved one due to death, at least six months ago, took part on the research. They completed a range of emotional self-report measures. All psychopathological variables showed high and significant relations with the intensity of grief. The centrality perceived and feelings of hostility predicted the score of complicated grief. Finally, the loss of a son was associated with complicated grief and with higher scores on the experiences of loss and emotional psychopathology. Symptom profile of those with complicated grief is associated with a large number of psychopathological variables, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of a son seems to be an important risk factor for developing complicated grief.",

      "title": "Suicidal ideation in older people, a public health matter",
      "abstract": "Introduction Suicide in older people is a critical public and mental health issue which requires attention, given that the ageing population is increasing. Multiple factors, including biological, psychological, and social stressors increase suicidal susceptibility. Unfortunately, elderly are more susceptible to these, such as psychiatric disturbances, physical comorbidities, prior suicide-related behaviours, lack of social support, grief, and increased difficulty in problem-solving Objectives In order to review the risk and protective factors, assessment and prevention of suicide in older adults. Methods Bibliographic research through PubMed and Web of Science. Results Older people can be subdivided into three age groups (from “young old” at 65 years old to “oldest old” after 85 years of age), with suicide being more prevalent in the oldest-old, and overall in men above 75 years old. Previous psychiatric background, suicidal attempts, substance abuse, poor physical health or disability, family psychiatric history, low social support or isolation, and finantial stress most frequently predispose to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or death by suicide in this community. Besides this, ageing relates to a tendency to cognitive impairment, which affects coping mechanisms, leading to deficits in reasoning and decision-making under stressful circumstances during depressive episodes. This can mediate suicidal ideation and associates to greater lethality methods. Geriatric suicidal attempters have been shown to have greater degrees of cortical and subcortical cerebral areas, including the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, as well as significant loss of volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, midbrain, cerebellum, lentiform nucleus and putamen. Abnormalities in these regions can impair executive and cognitive function, attention, problem solving and ultimately be responsible for suicidal behaviour. On the other hand, there are suicide protective elements such as physical and cognitive fitness, quality of life and life satisfaction, marital status, religiousness and social support. A prompt identification of modifiable risk factors and strengthening the protective ones by health professionals can reduce this prospect. Conclusions Suicidal ideation in older people is a multifactorial public health concern given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this population. Therefore, it is urgent to review and further research to build more effective suicide prevention strategies. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alpha‐mannosidosis is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID), moderate to severe neurosensory hearing loss, frequent infections, psychomotor disturbances and skeletal dysmorphism. For the first time, a panel of nine alpha‐mannosidosis patients with psychiatric symptoms is presented. The clinical picture has several similarities: a physical or psychological stressor precedes a rapid development of a state of confusion, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and often depression leading to a severe loss of function. This usually lasts 3–12 weeks, and is followed by a period of somnolence and asthenia. It may be more prevalent in females. In four of the described patients search for organic causes of the syndrome was performed, but revealed only negative findings. Because of the limited number of cases no firm conclusion about the benefit of various psychotropic drugs can be drawn from our observation. Psychiatric symptoms could affect as many as 25% of patients with alpha‐mannosidosis. First onset is typically in late puberty to early adolescence. The episodes may be recurrent, and of limited duration although medication may be necessary to alleviate symptoms. Our observations indicate that alpha‐mannosidosis is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. These should not be dismissed as part of the ID but should give rise to the initiation of adequate diagnostic work‐up, treatment and support.",

Despite the lack of robust scientific data, a number of clinical elements, such as the frequent preoccupation with this type of behavior, the time spent in sexual activities, the continuation of this behavior despite its negative consequences, the repeated and unsuccessful efforts made to reduce the behavior, are in favor of an addictive disorder. In addition there is a high comorbidity between excessive sexual behavior and other addictive behaviors.The phenomenology of excessive nonparaphilic sexual disorder favors its conceptualization as an addictive behavior, rather than an obsessive-compulsive, or an impulse control disorder. Moreover, the criteria that are quite close to those of addictive disorders were recently proposed for the future DSM-V in order to improve the characterization of this condition. Finally, controlled studies are warranted in order to establish clear guidelines for treatment of sexual addiction.",

Frigidity is an absence or lack of sexual pleasure sometimes to the extent of lack of orgasm. It can be due to fear, unresolved oedipal complex, anger, or depression. Psychotherapy is helpful, with antidepressants if appropriate. Dyspareunia is vaginal pain during sexual relations, and derives from the same types of psychological problems as frigidity. Dysmenorrhea can be related to conscious or unconscious rejection of the role of woman or mother. It is treated by psychotherapy. The sexual problems that are relieved easily by physical techniques or education are minor, while those deep in the personality and sustained by psychological mechanisms are major. Female sexual dysfunctions related to the female role are frigidity, dyspareunia, and vaginismus; those associated with the maternal role are dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, false pregnancy, vomiting in pregnancy, sterility, and sponaneous abortion.",

Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Сексуальные дисфункции при тревожных расстройствах",
      "abstract": "Введение. Являясь одним из широко распространенных психических заболеваний, тревожные расстройства часто сопровождаются сексуальными дисфункциями. Фармакотерапия, применяемая в лечении тревожных расстройств, в свою очередь может приводить к побочным сексуальным нарушениям. О наличии проблем в интимной сфере при обращении за психиатрической помощью сообщает лишь небольшая часть пациентов. Однако несвоевременное выявление сексуальных дисфункций может снижать приверженность терапии и ее эффективность. Материалы и методы. Статья посвящена обзору, основанному на 21 источнике, в том числе на 9 систематических обзорах и других исследованиях. Поиск данных осуществлялся по названиям, аннотациям и ключевым словам: сексуальная дисфункция, тревожное и стрессовое расстройства (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) в базах данных Elibrary и PubMed. Результаты. При тревожных расстройствах сексуальные дисфункции наблюдаются как у мужчин, так и у женщин и проявляются нарушениями всех фаз сексуальных реакций. Взаимосвязь сексуальных дисфункций с тревожными расстройствами объясняется тремя моделями. Первая, включающая причинно-следственные связи, предполагает, что корреляция между сексуальной дисфункцией и тревожными расстройствами часто является двунаправленной, причем симптомы сексуального и тревожного расстройства могут проявляться одновременно. Вторая модель предполагает наличие общего основного фактора или скрытой предиспозиции, вызывающих со временем развитие как психических, так и сексуальных расстройств, Третья модель концептуализирует сексуальные дисфункции как нарушения, не связанные с тревожными расстройствами. Заключение. На основании проведенного исследования авторами рекомендован следующий алгоритм курации пациентов, страдающих тревожными расстройствами и сексуальными нарушениями. На этапе обращения за психиатрической помощью, наряду со стандартными методами диагностики для определения выраженности психической патологии, целесообразно использовать опросники для оценки сексуальной функции. Кроме того, следует учитывать возможное негативное влияние фармакотерапии на сексуальную функцию и оценивать ее на всех этапах лечения для проведения своевременной коррекции. При выявлении сексуальных нарушений у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами с учетом клинической ситуации по возможности назначаются психотропные препараты с минимальным негативным влиянием на сексуальную функцию или без такового. При невозможности применения таких средств после достижения коррекции тревожной симптоматики могут быть снижены дозы используемых психотропных препаратов, рекомендованы перерывы в их приеме, в основном за 1-2 дня до предполагаемого сексуального контакта. При сохранении сексуальных нарушений в схему лечения в качестве антидота добавляется антидепрессант без влияния на сексуальную функцию или препараты для коррекции сексуальных нарушений – ингибиторы фосфодиэстеразы 5-го типа. Психотерапевтические мероприятия, включающие секс-терапию, являются неотъемлемой частью лечения сексуальных дисфункций у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами. Background. Anxiety disorders, being one of the widespread mental illnesses, are often accompanied by sexual dysfunctions. In turn, pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of affective disorders can lead to adverse sexual disorders. Only a small proportion of patients report having problems in the intimate sphere when seeking psychiatric help. However, untimely detection of sexual dysfunctions can reduce adherence and effectiveness of therapy. Materials and methods. The article is devoted to a review based on 21 sources, of which 9 are systematic reviews, as well as other studies. The data was searched by names, annotations and keywords: sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) in the databases Elibrary and PubMed. Results. In anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions are observed in both men and women and are manifested by violations of all phases of sexual reactions. The relationship of sexual dysfunction with anxiety disorders is explained by three models: the first, which includes causal relationships, suggests that the correlation between sexual dysfunction and anxiety disorders is often bidirectional, and the symptoms of sexual and anxiety disorders can manifest simultaneously; The second model assumes the presence of a common underlying factor, or hidden predisposition, causing the development of both mental and sexual disorders over time; the third model conceptualizes sexual dysfunctions as disorders unrelated to anxiety disorders. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, the authors recommended the following algorithm for the supervision of patients suffering from anxiety disorders and sexual disorders: at the stage of seeking psychiatric help, along with standard diagnostic methods to determine the severity of mental pathology, it is advisable to use questionnaires to assess sexual function. In addition, the possible negative effect of pharmacotherapy on sexual function should be taken into account and evaluated at all stages of treatment in order to carry out timely correction. If sexual disorders are detected in patients with anxiety disorders, taking into account the clinical situation, psychotropic drugs with no or minimal negative effect on sexual function are prescribed, if possible. In cases where it is impossible to use such drugs, after achieving correction of anxiety symptoms, the doses of psychotropic drugs used may be reduced, interruptions in their intake, mainly 1-2 days before the alleged sexual contact. If sexual disorders persist, an antidepressant with no effect on sexual function is added to the treatment regimen as an antidote, or drugs for correcting sexual disorders – type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Psychotherapeutic measures, including sex therapy, are an integral part of the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in patients with anxiety disorders.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "The role of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia outcome",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "title": "Mental Retardation: Biologic Aspects of Concern to Pediatricians",
      "abstract": "1. Approximately 3% of the population (6 to 7 million persons in the United States) is mentally retarded. Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ &amp;lt;50) occurs in about 10% (3 or 4 per 1,000 persons) and mild mental retardation (IQ 50 to 70) in 90%. 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

A two-compartment model consisting of and dependence was used to clarify clinical features of dependence. was defined by drug liking. Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

Stress in children is emotional and is characterized by an increase in the thymus, as well as an increase in the level of corticosteroids in the blood, as a reflection of the innate immune-lymphoid defense of the child, which occurs in the process of the childbirth stress of mother. Other indicators of neurohormonal protection (adrenal glands, spleen, eosinopenia, hyperglycemia) are typical but less pronounced than in adults due to functional immaturity of systems and organs. The shift in the balance of the prooxidant-antioxidant system is not marked. In addition, \" child \" stress is manifested by deficiency of magnesium ( Mg 2+ ), a violation of the acid balance and immune deficiency. The above data serve as the basis for the proof of the need of involving in everyday complex therapy of any disease, depending on the indications, along with formulary preparations in children's doses of herbal sedatives (Valeriana officinalis, Cardamine pratensis), psycho-responsive tranquilizers and even neuroleptics, magnesium preparations, Echinacea in combination with Zinc and vitamin C.

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Fatal catatonia is considered a complication to the usual schizophrenic course. The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia. The heredobiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the clinical course prove that this syndrome does not represent a separate schizophrenic group but merely a complication. The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Multiple chronic conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) increase a person’s depressive symptoms more than having one chronic condition. Little is known regarding whether multimorbidity similarly increases the depressive symptoms of one’s spouse and whether this depends on type of condition, gender, or both spouses’ health status. Analysis of multiple waves of the Health and Retirement Study reveals husband’s number of chronic conditions is positively related to wife’s depressive symptoms when both spouses are chronically ill. The association between wife’s chronic conditions and husband’s depressive symptoms is weaker and less robust. Type of chronic condition also matters but which type depends on the gender and health status of both spouses. By highlighting key contexts where chronic conditions are connected to spousal depressive symptoms, this study identifies areas of vulnerability and urges researchers and clinicians to consider multimorbidity when designing and implementing interventions, along with gender, both spouses’ chronic conditions, and condition type.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Learning-Theoretical Aspects of Primary Dysmenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract Women suffering from severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) show a typical behaviour pattern characterized by flight, avoidance, inactivity and helplessness. The question is if there is a common mechanism of origin in all those individual women who display such PD behaviour. A learning-theoretical model is presented concerning the origin of the connection between the stimulus of menstruation and the response of PD behaviour in women with severe PD: — Women have an increased physiological arousal premenstrually and during menstruation. — Women have a tendency to label the increased arousal negatively for two reasons: (1) Because of negative attitudes towards menstruation acquired from the social environment. (2) Because women have a lack of knowledge about their genitals and their functions, there is a lack of correct labelling of menstruation. Inexplicable arousal is mostly labelled as something “wrong”. — The negatively labelled increased arousal pre- and intermenstrually leads to an increased receptivity for conditioning. — The increased receptivity for conditioning means an increased proneness to react with a specific response to a certain stimulus, i. e. with PD behaviour as a response to the stimulus of menstruation. — Premenstrually highly anxious women are more receptive to conditioning than women who are not anxious premenstrually. The experience of PD makes the woman anticipate menstruation with anxiety, which thus forms the basis of a vicious circle. The validity of this theoretical model needs to be tested in experimental research.",

Female sex, the number of previous traumata, a past history of simple phobia, threatened death, trauma exposure, hospitalization for trauma-induced injuries increases the odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas a sense of control during the trauma, and alcohol consumption and intoxication decreases the odds of post-traumatic stress disorder. Major depression and anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, commonly occur in response to accidental man-made traumatic events. The extent of physical injury, sex, age, loss of control, type of trauma, and the degree of exposure to the traumatic event partly determine the occurrence of these co-morbid disorders. This suggests that trauma variables, which are related to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, are also related to the occurrence of these co-morbid disorders.",

Trots detta är nivåerna låga i jämförelse med hur vanliga psykiska sjukdomar som depressioner, ångestsjukdomar, alkoholmissbruk och psykoser är i befolkningen. Den psykiatriska sjukfrånvaron är en underskattning av det verk­liga sambandet mellan psykisk ohälsa och nedsatt arbetsförmåga. Epidemiologisk forskning av sjukfrånvaro bland kvinnor med psykiska problem visar att de har fler sjukfall och sjuk­ dagar än kvinnor utan psykiska problem. Detta gäller särskilt sjukfrånvaro i rörelseorganens sjukdomar. Det finns också intressanta könsskillnader när det gäller den psykiatriska sjuk­frånvaron. Kvinnor är oftare sjukskrivna, medan männen har längre sjukfall. Får kvinnor sämre behandling, vilket leder till att de på nytt blir sjukskrivna? Eller är det helt enkelt svårare för män att återgå till arbetet efter en sjukskrivningsperiod för psykisk sjukdom på grund av den traditionella mansrollen, där män förväntas vara \"starka\"? Både kvinnor och män som arbetar i extremt mans- respektive kvinnodominerade yrkesgrupper har förhöjd psykiatrisk sjukfrån­varo, vilket kan bero på ökade prestationskrav och svagare socialt stöd för könet i minoritet på arbetsplatsen",

The concept of health and disease varies with the sociocultural context. It is important to know the cultural characteristics to exercise good clinical practice. The stigma surrounding mental illness is widely known, and is even stronger in the Roma community, leading to marginalization and shame. Objectives We present a case of a gypsy woman misdiagnosed from the age of 8 with hebephrenic schizophrenia. Methods Patient frequents the emergency department with symptoms of predominantly anxiety, including episodes of psychomotor agitation, self-harm, verbalization of visual hallucinations of a mystical-religious nature. In treatment with antipsychotics since diagnosis, with no therapeutic adherence. It is observed during all the episodes how the anxiolytic treatment, even, sometimes, the verbal restraint, make the symptoms subside. Psychotic symptoms over the years are ruled out. Results Due to the diagnosis, this patient has been relegated from the gypsy community, she has not married or had children (an important milestone in gypsy culture), this has generated an exponential increase in anxiety symptoms and home problems. Conclusions It is important to know the cultural traits to which the patients we treat in consultation belong, and how the disease can affect their lives, and a simple diagnosis can be a source of greater anxiety.

      "abstract": "Short or tall stature is primarily a normal variation of height. It is part of the continuum of the normal Gaussian distribution curve which defines the lower and upper limit of normal as the 3rd and 97th percentile. Within this context it is very important to differentiate normal variations in height and growth from pathological conditions. Normal variations in height are familial and idiopathic short or tall stature. Normal variations in growth are diagnosed as constitutional acceleration or constitutional delay of growth and puberty and are observed on all percentiles. Patients with pathological conditions of height usually have a syndromal, skeletal or chromosomal disorders such as Russell-Silver or Marfan syndrome, achondroplasia, Ullrich-Turner or Klinefelter syndrome. Many of the disorders with short stature have intrauterine growth retardation. The (mean) final height does not necessarily follow the target height range, but reaches a height below or above the population 3rd or 97th percentile. Patients with pathological conditions of growth can have short, normal or tall stature. They have a reduced or increased growth rate caused by a wide variety of chronic organic or psychosomatic diseases. At present, treatment with growth hormone (GH) is available for patients with GH deficiency, Ullrich-Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, small for gestational age and Prader-Willi syndrome. The indication for GH treatment of idiopathic short stature is so far only approved in the USA. Adult height data indicate that patients with documented GH deficiency reach an adult height within their target height range. For all other indications a statistically significant improvement in adult height has been documented. In the long-term follow-up of these patients not only a statistically significant but also a clinically relevant improvement in adult height should be demonstrated. Depending on the results, some of the indications for GH therapy might have to be reconsidered.",

      "abstract": "In the weeks leading up to menstruation, the majority of women of reproductive age experience some physical discomfort or distress. Although symptoms are frequently not severe enough to interfere significantly with daily activities, they can be. Thus, severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects 5–8% of women; the majority of these individuals also match the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The most bothersome symptoms are those that affect mood and behaviour, such as irritability, tension, depression, weepiness, and mood swings, however physical issues like breast soreness and bloating can also be a concern. We discuss two basic treatments for severe PMS: one that targets the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and the other that targets brain serotonergic synapses. We also present theories regarding the underlying causes of severe PMS. The symptoms are caused by fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels, hence treatments that stop ovarian cyclicity, such as long acting analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or oestradiol (given as patches or implants), can successfully diminish the symptoms. It is also widely known that serotonin reuptake inhibitors, whether used continuously or just during luteal stages, are helpful.",

      "abstract": "It is natural to assume that because a psychosis occurs during the process of childbearing the two events are therefore necessarily associated, but the evidence is conflicting and the relationship between them has not been established with certainty. In fact no immediate dramatic cause has yet been demonstrated that would account for such mental breakdowns, and it would be surprising if it had, for the great majority of psychoses not related to maternity show no simple sequence of cause and effect. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required.

They present: a)viral etiology from: Epstein-Barr virus with pyscho-somatic substrate. b)Immune factors: inflammatory cytokine IL-1, T.N.F. alpha. c)Organic etiology: alteration of biochemical and morphological markers, metabolic oxidative stress. d)Psychological or traumatic stress : anxiety, reactive depression, panic attacks whiplash. e)Environmental factors : change in electromagnetic fields, geopathic stress, pesticide poisoning with multiple chemical syndrome, mercury poisoning. f)Dietary factors : presence of glutamate in food. g)Gulf war syndrome : 30% of soldiers develop P. F. S. MATERIAL and METHODS: The patient is evaluated from a psychological point of view (psychological trauma), associated with the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Naltrexone hydrocloride low dose and Cell Food-S-Adenosin Methionine. With additional therapies : Mineralogram , Chelation Therapy , Viral Seriology with Labò Live , Micro-immunotherapy (with homeopathic interleukin), Dr. Pierpaoli protocol with the use of vitamins A, D, E, C, Melatonin, Glutathione, Ubiquinone. Protocol: -Infiltration of the Trigger Points, mix of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) concentration 15-10 mcgrg/mL in cycles assessed with the Kinesiology Test (K.T.) -Minor Autohemotherapy (PAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Major Autohemotherapy (GAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Rectal insufflation (R.I.) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) From 1988 to 2017, I have treated 900 cases with this method, with the following results : significant symptom remission in the secondary form in around 60-70% of patients treated with infiltration of the Trigger Points and PAET. In more resistant cases, I have used homotoxicology, psychological counseling, Dr. Pierpaoli protocol and micro-immunotherapy RESULTS: These method results in good symptom remission in 50-60% of the cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: In the multi-factor genesis of PFS, an early diagnosis is important to prevent the pain occurring alongside psycho-somatic disturbances, which lead the subject into a reactive-depressive state. In the complex symptom variety, the obtained percentage results have improved with this additional method, as, by alleviating the symptoms, you assure a better quality of life for the patient.",

The majority of cases have an organic etiology, most commonly vascular disease that decreases blood flow into the penis. Regardless of the primary cause, erectile dysfunction can have a negative impact on self-esteem, quality of life and interpersonal relationships. The initial step in evaluation is a detailed medical and social history, including a review of medication use. Discussion with the patient's sexual partner may clarify exacerbating issues. The physical examination focuses on the cardiovascular, neurologic and urogenital systems. Laboratory tests are useful to screen for common etiologic factors and, when indicated, to identify hypogonadal syndromes.

Tidak seperti tipe skizofrenia lainnya (hebefrenik, paranoid, dan katatonik), skizofrenia simpleks sulit ditemukan dan ditentukan diagnosisnya. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang.

Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

Psychosocial treatments must be used in conjunction with medication during the maintenance phase to improve adherence to treatment and to achieve - through the management of psychological variables - better social, work, and family functioning.

      "title": "Genital self‑mutilation: A challenging pathology (Review)",
      "abstract": "Genital self‑mutilation is a pathology that leads to numerous and important discussions, rarely presented in the medical literature. There have been many attempts to explain the reasons behind these medical phenomena, but single cases have been generally reported, making it extremely difficult to draw valid conclusions. It is acknowledged that there are psychotic and non‑psychotic causes, from psychiatric problems and sexual identity disorders to cultural or religious reasons, alcohol or recreational drug consumption, unconventional types of sexual satisfaction or self‑satisfaction. Recent theories consider self‑mutilation as a phenomenon of reducing distress or tension, as an expression of feelings of anger or sorrow. It is believed that 55‑85% of those who have resorted to self‑mutilation have at least once in their life tried to commit suicide. There is evidence that early discovery and intervention as well as proper treatment in regards to psychosis can significantly reduce the number of self‑mutilation episodes, with a protective role of these individuals. Cases of genital self‑mutilation may be considered real medical emergencies, sometimes extremely challenging and accompanied by severe complications. Injury of the genital area is usually accompanied by numerous early or long‑term complications due to the marked vascular area and to the microbial flora present in this part of the body. The degree of mutilation is an unforeseen aspect that the medical staff may have to encounter during the intervention, sometimes testing their imagination and surgical skills when dealing with such a case. Understanding the causes of these self‑aggressive behaviors, which may be life‑threatening, is critical and multidisciplinary mobilization is needed after treatment of the acute phases. The outcome of these patients depends on integrated collaborative work. These cases represent a serious reason for frustration for the physicians involved in solving them, and knowledge of these issues is valuable to urologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.",

Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "title": "Evaluación del efecto antidepresivo del secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas precondicionadas en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor",
      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

His family may persuade him to visit a general practitioner for treatment of some physical complication of his drinking much more readily and much earlier in his drinking career than they can persuade him to see a psychiatrist. Alcoholics do not show any great affinity for psychiatrists and may openly resent being considered psychiatric patients. This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

Bipolar illness is transmitted in some families as an X‐linked dominant factor. In other families, X‐linked transmission does not occur. Hence, bipolar illness may be similar to retinitis pigmentosa. This makes some types of genetic counseling difficult to apply to bipolar families. There is no evidence that unipolar depressive illness is transmitted by an X‐linked factor. Family studies indicate that there might be more than one type of unipolar illness. Limited prediction of risk of depression and other psychiatric conditions in other family members can be based on family studies which show that alcoholism and personality disorder occur frequently in families of early onset depressives but much less frequently in families of late onset depressives (age 40 or older).",

We have shown that depressed mood and depressive cognition are not related to the negative syndrome, but there is some overlap between the specific phenomena of depressive illness and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Items measuring cognitive impairment have a moderate correlation with the negative syndrome, but the negative syndrome accounts for less than half of the variance of cognitive performance.

OAB may be idiopathic or may occur with other common conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction, neurological disease, or stress incontinence. Primary care physicians may safely diagnose this condition by history and physical exam with a minimum of widely available lab tests. Management with behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy is generally quite successful and warranted. Multiple anticholinergic medications are available and have been shown to be effective. Subtle differences in structure and mechanism of these agents may yield improved therapeutic benefit or tolerability and thus it is reasonable to try more than one drug to achieve the optimal results. For patients that fail behavioral and initial pharmacotherapy or when other complicating conditions are identified, referral to a specialist is indicated; however, the majority of patients with OAB do not require cystoscopy or urodynamics. Successful treatments for OAB do exist and it is worth screening for these disabling complaints at the primary care level.",

Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important.

      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges.

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the person’s quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery. The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies considerably between studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence. Objectives The focus of this e-poster is to explore the incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of depression disorder and antidepressant iatrogenic sexual dysfunction. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: depression, sexual disfunction, antidepressant. Results Sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of depression. Although decreased libido is most often reported, difficulties with arousal, resulting in vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men, and absent or delayed orgasm are also prevalent. Sexual dysfunction is also a frequent adverse effect of treatment with most antidepressants and is one of the predominant reasons for premature drug discontinuation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most widely prescribed antidepressants and have significant effects on arousal and orgasm compared with antidepressants that target norepinephrine, dopamine, and melatonin systems. The availability of an antidepressant that does not cause or exacerbate sexual dysfunction represents an advance in pharmacotherapy for mood disorders and should reduce treatment noncompliance and decrease the need for switching antidepressants. Conclusions The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women.

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionA lot many factors are available which contribute to this avoidable adventure. Out of these few which are highly relevant have been lineated as follows. Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

En la epilepsia catamenial, su patron de ocurrencia de CE es predecible y ciclico (75%); probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales del periodo menstrual, observandose acentuacion de las CE en los 2 a 3 dias previos a la misma, y con el primer y segundo dias de sangrado menstrual. Metodologia: realizamos una investigacion tipo clinico experimental prospectivo con grupo control, sobre la evolucion clinica de 11 pacientes que presentaban EA con patron ciclico de los cuales 6 recibieron terapia intermitente profilactica con midazolam y 5 pacientes intermitente de ataque con midazolam durante 8 meses. Resultados: Disminucion en la frecuencia de CE en acumulos, mayor al 50% en quienes recibieron tratamiento profilactico con MDZ; contrario a las pacientes con tratamiento de ataque con MDZ, quienes no modificaron la frecuencia de su EA. Conclusiones: El MDZ surge como terapia profilactica eficaz en el control de la epilepsia catamenial en acumulos. El midazolam se plantea como alternativa eficaz para el manejo de EA; planteandose que su utilizacion por V.O, ofrece facil administracion y seguridad.",

In some instances, such hypertension develops from a benign form, while in others it is malignant in type, almost from its inception; the latter type has constituted approximately 10 per cent. of the total number of cases in our hospital experience. The cause of the disease is unknown; the course is stormy and rapid; the prognosis is extremely grave, and the medical treatment is entirely unsatisfactory. The clinical symptoms are: (1) marked and continuous elevation of systolic blood pressure and disproportionately high diastolic pressure; (2) cerebral manifestations—that is, excruciating dull headaches, intermittent or continuous in character, affecting as a rule the entire cranium, but centering especially in the occiput—insomnia, irritability and mental deterioration, changes in personality and at times apoplectic or epileptiform seizures; (3)",

Symptoms of ADHD have been found to be relatively consistent from childhood through adolescence, whereas adults with ADHD tend to exhibit more symptoms of inattention than hyperactivity. Women and girls with ADHD have generally been insufficiently studied. Whereas core symptoms of ADHD are largely similar between boys and girls, girls exhibit less hyperactivity and comorbid conduct disorder. The precise aetiology of ADHD is unclear, and multiple biopsychosocial risk factors may act independently or in concert to produce disorder. Genetic vulnerability, pre- and perinatal exposures, and psychosocial factors have been found to increase risk of the disorder and its persistence. Childhood ADHD is associated with negative outcomes, such as school underachievement and substance use disorders. Rates of persistence of ADHD from childhood into adolescence and adulthood range widely depending on definition of ADHD and source of reporting of symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Upper extremity impairment rarely is assessed using grip strength, according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), because results can be influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control, including sex, age, comorbidities, fatigue, handedness, time of day, pain, and the individual's cooperation. The AMA Guides, Section 16.5b, Impairment Evaluation Methods, discusses the approach used for rating peripheral nerve injuries, but this section applies only to specific nerve lesions with resulting weakness of the muscles supplied or sensory changes. Strength correlates only poorly with performance of the activities of daily living, and grip strength testing using a dynamometer or other types of isometric strength testing has not been shown to reliably discriminate between submaximal and maximal efforts. Grip strength usually is not used in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of body parts (eg, missing digit), nor is it used to rate weakness from a peripheral nerve lesion. In rare cases, the AMA Guides allows the use of loss of strength (eg, due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect). Impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence, and loss of strength is rarely combined and only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes.",

      "abstract": "A review of social aspects of epilepsy is given. Similar to the own experience the literature shows only little social prestige given to patients with epilepsy, an experience known from persons with psychiatric disorders. The prevalence rate for chronic epilepsy is 0.5%. So called genuine seizures decreased with diagnostic progress during the last years (about 50%). Lower social classes and negative social patterns are characteristic of employees with epileptic fits. Unemployed persons show normal social structure. A relation to social class and onset of epilepsy exists. Epileptics are socially immobile. Like other persons with chronic diseases epilepsy produces a special social attitude and often negative therapeutic motivation. In contrast to the literature non-hospitalized epileptics show normal intelligence. Neurotic symptoms are seen in many cases however (about 40%). Often social disturbances origin from broken home situations. There is no specific social and mental defect. According to the own experience social integration of epileptics depends upon the local economic structure. The common prejudice varies with the local area. Social drop-outs are not due to the seizures, but occur mainly in mentally retarded persons who are not able to follow therapeutic regimens. Delinquency is increased among the own patients (18%). The causes are psychoorganic syndromes, often in connection with negative therapeutic motivation and alcoholism. The tendency to specific crimes, known from the literature, could not be confirmed. Forensic problems in direct connection with epileptic fits are rare. Medical problems concerning ability to drive often occur. Many patients possess a driver licence (46.5%), gained after onset of epilepsy in 50%. But the accident rate is lower than in the general population. Special outpatient departments and therapeutic groups for epileptics--affiliated to neurological centers--can improve the exact diagnosis, therapeutic motivation and social integration.",

Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

      "title": "Management of Antidepressant-Induced Sexual Dysfunction: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the mainstay of treatment for various psychiatric conditions, including but not limited to major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa, sexual side effects from these medications are common. These side effects include decreased libido, difficulty with arousal and erection, and delayed or absent orgasm, which can be troubling for many patients and impact adherence to treatment and quality of life. This is an important distinction from decreased libido that can be seen in the natural course of depression; the sexual dysfunction discussed in this paper is due to an adverse effect of SSRIs. The goal of this narrative review is to explore the effectiveness of switching antidepressant therapy or adding adjunctive medications or herbal supplements in alleviating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD). An electronic literature search was performed on PubMed to identify full-text, English-language articles that discussed antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD). Selected articles were published between 1996 and 2023. Replacing one antidepressant class for another with a more favorable side effect profile (e.g., mirtazapine, nefazodone, and vortioxetine) may be effective for some patients, especially if the initial antidepressive treatment was not sufficient in controlling the symptoms caused by the primary mental illness. Several adjunctive medications and supplements also show promise in the management of AISD, including bupropion and saffron (Crocus sativus). Findings surrounding other adjunctive treatments are promising, though more robust studies are needed. Evidence for switching to vilazodone to treat AISD is conflicting, as is data surrounding the effect of Ginkgo biloba on AISD. Data surrounding AISD management is increasing, but remains relatively scarce. Further studies are necessary to understand AISD's pathophysiology and current interventions. Development and use of other drugs, supplements, and nonpharmacological agents should be explored in this patient population to broaden effective management options for AISD.",

      "title": "The Impact of Psychotropics on Sexuality: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunctions related to psychotropic drugs are among the most distressing adverse effects and can lead to non-adherence to treatment. Objectives To elucidate the mechanisms of psychotropic-induced sexual dysfunctions and to suggest strategies for their management. Methods Literature review based on the keywords “psychotropics,” “sexuality,” and “sexual dysfunction”. Results Psychotropic medications can impact sexuality either directly or indirectly. The direct effect is primarily due to a decrease in the mesocortical dopaminergic atmosphere, either by blocking D2 receptors or by stimulating 5HT2A receptors. D2 receptor blockade in the tubero-infundibular pathway triggers an increase in prolactin secretion, which can subsequently lead to erection problems, decreased libido, and difficulties achieving orgasm. Action in the nigrostriatal pathway may result in an extrapyramidal syndrome, which can, in turn, hinder intimate physical relations. The indirect effect can also be caused by metabolic complications, which are significant risk factors for sexual dysfunction, as they can lead to male hypogonadism and a negative self-image. Therapeutic strategies suggest either reducing doses (if the patient’s condition allows), changing the drug, or adding an adjunctive medication. Aripiprazole, being a partial agonist of D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist of D3 and 5-HT2A receptors, appears to cause fewer sexual dysfunctions and can reduce hyperprolactinemia when added to other antipsychotics. Conclusions Healthcare professionals must proactively gather information on sexuality given its impact on quality of life and treatment adherence. Prioritizing this dimension of well-being demonstrates a respectful approach toward the patient and establishes the foundation for a strong therapeutic alliance.

      "title": "Marital Discord in the Context of a Depressive Episode: Research on Efficacy and Effectiveness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Couples in which one partner is diagnosable as depressed are encountered by virtually every marital therapist. In addition, couples in which one or both partners have significant levels of depressive symptoms are the norm rather than the exception in marital therapy. Similarly, therapists treating depressed clients individually often discover that marital distress is a major influence in many aspects of their clients’ lives. In response to the apparent interconnection of marital discord and adult unipolar depression, the topic of marital therapy for depressed adults has become an important focus of research. Several questions have been partially answered: Do marital problems precede and predict continuation of depressive symptoms or episodes of depression? Does marital therapy for depression produce improvement in couple distress, in depression, or both? Can marital distress be treated while a depressive episode is ongoing or only after it is over? Would a successful individually focused intervention for a depressive episode cause marital stress to disappear? What specific culture, age, and gender features influence the relationship between marital distress and depression? Our goal in the current chapter is to address these and other questions by presenting major findings in the literature to date and by summarizing them into a relatively simple argument as follows. Marital problems are often present for depressed persons; these problems are serious, and they carry unacceptable consequences for those depressed clients who suffer with them.",

      "abstract": "Depresija je cesto nedijagnosticirana i nelijecena u starijih osoba cemu pridonosi mit da je depresivnost uobicajena u osoba starije životne dobi i prirodna reakcija na promjene koje starija životna dob nosi.Uz uobicajene simptome depresije prema MKB-10 Međunarodnoj klasifikaciji bolesti i srodnih zdravstvenih problema, kod osoba starije životne dobi postoje specificni dodatni simptomi: a) pritužbe na bolove, umor, gubitak apetita, poteskoce usnivanja i prosnivanja, tjeskoba, palpitacije ; b) razdražljivost, promjene raspoloženja, konstantne pritužbe, nista sto se ucini za osobu nije dovoljno dobro ; c) poteskoce u koncentraciji i pamcenju, pretjeran osjecaj tuge, nemogucnost uživanja u ranijim aktivnostima i d) pricanje o beskorisnosti ne vrijedi vise nikome. U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Dementia‐Like Syndrome Following Recall of Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the trauma and many years later. To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

The syndrome is more frequent in female patients, who usually believe that their lover is a man belonging to a higher social and economic class, or is married, unknown, or even imaginary or deceased person. The course of the syndrome is usually chronic, with serious problematic behavioural consequences, including stalking behaviours, such as repetitive calling, unexpected visits or continuous attempts to send gifts or letters. According to the DSM-5, this syndrome is included in the erotomanic type of the delusional disorder, however, it is usually neglected in psychiatric practice and almost forgotten by modern psychiatrists.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms in later life",
      "abstract": "Het onderzoek in dit proefschrift is voortgekomen uit ervaringen in de klinische praktijk. Ouderen presenteren zich regelmatig met lichamelijke klachten zonder dat er bij uitvoerig lichamelijk onderzoek lichamelijke oorzaken worden gevonden die deze klachten volledig kunnen verklaren. Ouderen richten zich met deze klachten vaak in eerste instantie tot de huisarts of een somatisch georienteerde specialist. Wanneer deze geen afwijkingen vindt, zijn oudere patienten moeilijk te motiveren psychologische aspecten nader te laten onderzoeken door een psychiater of psycholoog. Patienten ervaren een dergelijke doorverwijzing vaak als een afwijzing. Om dit probleem het hoofd te bieden is er een polikliniek opgericht voor onderzoek en behandeling van Somatisch Onvoldoende verklaarde Lichamelijke Klachten (SOLK) bij ouderen in Nijmegen waar patienten achtereenvolgens worden gezien door klinisch geriater, psychiater en psycholoog. Onze kennis over SOLK is nagenoeg volledig gebaseerd op onderzoek bij jongere volwassenen. Zo weten we dat SOLK bij deze leeftijdsgroep veel voorkomen: tussen 30-50% van de klachten waarvoor patienten hun huisarts bezoeken zijn klachten zonder duidelijke lichamelijke oorzaak. Als de klachten aanhouden en patienten hulp blijven zoeken, kan dat frustraties opleveren voor zowel patienten als hulpverleners. Mensen met SOLK ervaren vaak een hoge lijdensdruk en rapporteren vaak een lage kwaliteit van leven. Tevens is er een hoge co-morbiditeit met depressie en angstproblemen. In hoeverre SOLK voorkomen bij ouderen en hoe dit samenhangt met de kwaliteit van leven voor ouderen is nauwelijks bekend. In hoofdstuk 1 illustreren we drie oudere patienten die de specifieke problemen bij SOLK op latere leeftijd goed weergeven. Vermoedelijk dat juist deze specifieke problemen bijdragen aan de geringe aandacht voor SOLK in deze leeftijdsgroep. Voorbeeld 1 betreft een 75 jarige vrouw met pijn aan haar benen. Diverse medisch specialisten vonden geen oorzaak voor haar klachten; de medische verslaglegging spreekt over “leeftijd gerelateerde klachten” of “slijtage”. De huisarts dacht vervolgens aan een (gemaskeerde) depressie, maar behandeling hierop gericht sloeg niet aan. Hierop werd zij verwezen naar onze polikliniek in verband met onverklaarde pijn aan haar benen. Bij aanvullend onderzoek door de klinisch geriater werd alsnog een lichamelijke oorzaak gevonden, namelijk een vernauwing van haar wervelkanaal. Dit voorbeeld illustreert hoe moeilijk het is om verklaarde en onverklaarde klachten bij ouderen uit elkaar te houden. Met enige regelmaat worden lichamelijke klachten ten onrechte aan normale veroudering toegewezen. Voorbeeld 2 betreft een 75-jarige vrouw met langdurige maag- en darmklachten. Zij is tevens bekend met recidiverende, depressieve stemmingen. Ondanks verschillende behandelingen door zowel een psychiater als door internist en gynaecoloog blijven de klachten bestaan. Op onze polikliniek stellen we een depressieve stoornis vast. Wanneer we deze strak volgens de richtlijnen behandelen verbetert niet alleen haar stemming, maar verdwijnen ook haar de lichamelijke klachten. Dit voorbeeld geeft aan dat depressies en SOLK nauw met elkaar zijn verweven op latere leeftijd en soms moeilijk uit elkaar te houden zijn.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "title": "Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (‘awake dreaming’). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "Many varieties of psychiatric and psychological treatment have been touted as effective for the paraphilias, which are disorders of sexual behavior requiring unusual or bizarre imagery or acts for sexual excitement. Hormonal alteration of sexual arousal with anti-androgens, particularly Medroxyprogesterone Acetate {MPA), has gained popularity in the last two decades. MPA results in a reversible, dose-dependent reduction in plasma testosterone, with a concomitant reduction in sexual fantasy, arousal, and per formance. Side effects and complications are minimal. Medication is one component in a comprehensive treatment plan which is designed to deal with the patient's medical, social, family, and psychological problems. Implications of the paraphilias and their treatment for the family are discussed. The mental health professional may be confronted at times with sexual problems which have social and legal ramifications as well as clinical ones. Among the most challenging of such sexual problems to treat are the paraphilias. After a referral of the paraphiliac patient to the mental health professional occurs, a decision must be made about what form of treatment can be offered to the patient. Consideration must also be given to prevention of recurrence of the presenting sexual problem. Medroxy progesterone acetate is one possible treatment for the paraphilias which has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Generally there has been little sociological interest in the paraphilias and their treatment despite obvious profound and disruptive effects upon marriage and the family.",

      "abstract": "General practice is characterised by its person-centred approach. It crosses the boundaries of all the medical disciplines as well as the boundary between medical and social problems. Family physicians are committed to dealing with whatever problem the patient presents. This is particularly relevant when women present with premenstrual complaints, since most do not have PMS as defined by researchers. Many have problems external to the menstrual cycle contributing to symptoms. Detection of these external factors, be they intercurrent medical, psychiatric or social problems, frequently determines treatment.To describe a simple model of premenstrual complaints which includes all women who present in this way, in order ot inform GPs of the common patterns of illness in this group and provide them with a systematic approach to management.The model contains up to four levels of activity which may contribute to the complaint. These are: 1. menstrual cycle physiology--resulting in cyclical changes in mood, breast and bloating 2. intercurrent pathology (comorbidity)--gynaecological, psychiatric and medical 3. the social context of marital, family and work relationships, cultural influences 4. interpretation (attribution)--the meaning attached to the experience of the first 3 factors.",

      "abstract": "When compared to the general population, police officers are at a substantially increased risk for operational stress injuries due to their inherent exposure in the line of duty to a number of potentially psychologically traumatic events. Well-established in the police literature remains that these experiences of intense stress and the accompanying psychological strain may lead to a variety of mental health challenges for police, including symptoms of compromised mental health (i.e., burnout, low resilient coping) and mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, or general anxiety disorder. Though progress has been made in several jurisdictions around the world to improve the availability of mental health resources, treatment options, and other support for police, challenges and organizational barriers (i.e., staff shortages, workload issues, work–life balance, poor perceptions of leadership, stigma, constant changes in legislation) persist in some services across regions, which have been found to decrease enthusiasm toward treatment-seeking, and in turn, amplify challenges tied to police officers’ mental health and well-being. When services are present, police can experience barriers to service utilization, such as concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma, departmental distrust, or negative perceptions of treatment (i.e., they will be viewed by colleagues as weak, no longer fit for the job, or taking advantage of the system). For police to disclose their mental health status and needs, they must be first comfortable doing so in a supportive, professionalized, and de-stigmatized workplace where there is increasing police awareness of and education about mental health, as well as preventative resources that promote wellness, healthy lifestyle choices, and coping skills. Additional research is needed that examines the changing and current mental health of police officers as well as the context and content informing the high prevalence of mental health disorders.",

      "abstract": "The age at which individuals are most physically aggressive is 22 months. However, some children fail to inhibit this normal aggression and by the time they are three or four are showing signs of oppositional defiant disorder. In older children persistent antisocial behaviour is classified as conduct disorder. At any age, antisocial behaviour is on a continuum, and while the most severe 5% or so will meet diagnostic criteria, those falling short are often described as having conduct problems. Epidemiological follow-up surveys show that the risk of poor outcomes in antisocial children is very high. The causes are multiple but two sets of factors stand out. First, genetic predisposition. Even children adopted away from violent or criminal parents have three or four times the rate of antisocial behaviour and second, poor parenting. Watching and waiting is a reasonable strategy if the antisocial behaviour is not very severe. It is important to be vigilant for severe tantrums or aggression occurring almost every day, harsh, rough, or inconsistent parenting and coexistent ADHD. If severity is moderate, referral to an evidence-based parenting group would be a good first move. If this fails to make things better, or if the child or parent has a comorbid condition, referral to CAMHS is indicated. For older children, aged 10 to 17, there are effective interventions such as anger management CBT and parenting groups for adolescents.",

      "title": "Geriatric Seizures",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Seizures have been defined as an intermittent derangement of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. The discharge results in an almost instantaneous disturbance of sensation, convulsive movements, altered or impaired cognition, or some combination thereof.1 Although seizures originating in patients aged 65 and older were once considered to be rare, they are remarkably frequent, with an incidence rate higher than 100 in 100,000. On an age-specific basis, other than the neonatal period, the highest incidence of new onset seizures occurs in the population aged 65 and older.2 Clinically, geriatric seizures are not different from those of children, adolescents, and younger adults, except for petit mal siezures, which almost never originate in older persons.3 Moreover, onset of seizures after aged 65 years and older is more often symptomatic and associated with injury than in younger individuals.4 The incidence of late-onset seizure progressively increases with each decade beyond age 60 (see Table 1).5 The etiology of this occurrence depends to a large extent on age and “cognitive integrity.”6 The most common etiologies of geriatric seizures include, with ranges of frequency, cerebrovascular disease (11%–54%), undetermined, (13%–43.5%), brain neoplasm (2.1%–33%), multifactorial etiology (6%–20%), head trauma (4.3%–21%), Alzheimers disease (9.1%–17%), metabolic disorders (6.5%–10%), and central nervous system infection (2%–4%).7-9 Seizures are the third-most-common neurological disorder in older persons, with cerebrovascular accidents being the most-common precipitant for a seizure after the age of 60. Neurodegenerative diseases are now accepted as a not-infrequent cause of seizures in older people,3 and advanced Alzheimer's disease is associated with a sixfold increased risk of unprovoked seizure, after controlling for age and gender.10 Older persons and dementia populations differ as to proportion and type of neurotransmitter declines but both are overrepresented in epilepsy epidemiology. Neuronal conduction abnormalities in the aging brain, whether associated with changes in the amount or activity of specific neurotransmitters or with reduced sensitivity to them, is thought to be associated with some of the more-prevalent emotional, behavioral, and neurological disorders of older persons. The relationship between central nervous system function and individual neurotransmitters remains only partially recognized. Less well appreciated is the interdependency of major neurotransmitter systems. Understanding of the intra- and interdependent roles within the central neurointegrative network may provide new insights into disorders of cognition in older people. As researchers gain more appreciation of the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we may be able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.11",

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

Libido may be decreased by drugs that block dopamine or testosterone, or that cause dysphoria.

Ejaculation may be diminished by drugs that affect spinal reflexes or be inhibited by ganglion blockage. Enervation of the vas deferens and epididymis may be blocked and cause a smaller emission. Retrograde ejaculation may occur due to blockage of the internal urethral sphincter. Orgasm is usually inhibited by the drugs that inhibit ejaculation. Fertility is impaired by drugs that affect sexual performance or spermatogenesis. Major groups of drugs that may affect male sexual function include drugs of abuse, CNS depressants, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, psychotherapeutics, hormones, and cancer therapeutics, in addition to miscellaneous other agents. Information about these drugs has been arranged in tables so that the provider has a convenient reference to use when explaining to men the effect of drugs on sexual response and fertility.",

A range of antipsychotic medications are available; however, suboptimal therapeutic response in terms of psychotic symptoms is common and affects up to one-third of people with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms are generally less amenable to treatment. Because of the consequences of inadequate symptom control, effective treatment strategies are required for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine has been shown to be more effective than other antipsychotics in treatment-resistant populations in several studies; however, the occurrence of adverse effects, some of which are potentially life-threatening, are important limitations. In addition to those who are intolerant to clozapine, only 30% to 50% experience clinically significant symptom improvement. This review describes the recent evidence for treatment strategies for people not responding to nonclozapine antipsychotic agents and people not responding or only partially responding to clozapine.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien.

Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée.

      "title": "[Infertility: psychological-psychopathological consequences and cognitive-behavioural interventions].",
      "abstract": "Infertility primarily refers to the biological inability of a man or a woman to contribute to conception. Infertility may also refer to the state of a woman who is unable to carry a pregnancy to full term, however other causes can be found in both sexes. The diagnosis of infertility and the concurrent medical treatment are rather stressful events for the couple and can provoke a number of negative symptoms such as depression, anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms which may interfere with the medical therapeutic procedures especially with the in-vitro fertilisation technique. The relationship between infertility and psychological factors has not been explored fully and are still under research. However current findings can be summarized in three basic hypotheses; namely, the effect of psychological factors on the appearance of infertility, the psychological consequences of infertility at the couple, and the reciprocal relation of psychological factors and infertility. Stress and anxiety activate the hypothalamic-adrenal axis (HPA), and this activation can disturb the hormones of fertility. The presence of depressive/anxiety symptoms seems to have a negative impact on the treatment of infertility and sometimes can be a risk factor for lower pregnancy rate. There is a possibility that psychological complaints could develop, prior, during and after the diagnosis of infertility and may interfere with the fertilisation therapy. Should such psychological complaints develop it is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment is used in conjunction with the treatment approach of infertility, e.g. IVF. The above mentioned suggestion is supported by a large number of researchers and current research efforts focus on different psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has shown during research its superiority compared to other psychotherapeutic interventions and that could be an effective way to decrease the depressive and anxiety symptoms during several stages of the infertility treatment. Moreover Cognitive-Behavioural Group Therapy seems to strengthen the infertile couple's ability to deal with possible changes and the stress during the infertility treatment. It has also been reported in the research community that the use of CBT can improve the pregnancy rate. However, this finding should be viewed with caution due to its insufficient body of evidence and methodological problems incurred.",

      "abstract": "Somatization, broadly defined as the presentation of one or more medically unexplained somatic symptoms, refers both to the presentation of somatic symptoms in diagnosable psychiatric disorders such as major depression or anxiety as well as to the presentation of such symptoms in somatoform disorders. Although no comparative data exist, somatization is considered by many clinical investigators to be more common among Chinese than Caucasian patients, but it is unclear if this occurs because somatoform disorders are more prevalent among the Chinese or because Chinese patients with major depression or anxiety more often present with somatic complaints. We examined 85 consecutive Chinese American and 85 consecutive Caucasian American patients referred for psychiatric consultation and found the following: a) True somatization was significantly more common among Chinese American patients referred for psychiatric consultation; b) The somatoform symptom profiles of the two cohorts were different: Chinese American somatizers complained predominantly of cardiopulmonary and vestibular symptoms, whereas their Caucasian counterparts had symptoms that corresponded well with the categories listed in DSM-IV; c) In both cohorts of somatizers, a concurrent psychiatric disorder, most commonly major depression, was almost always present; and d) Among the Chinese American somatizers, pseudoneurological symptoms occurred most commonly in the form of abnormal sensations, whereas abnormal motor functions were more common among Caucasian Americans. Implications of the findings with respect to pathogenesis, treatment, and classification of somatization are discussed.",

Some did so perhaps in the expectation that mental disturbances arising out of war experiences would show specific clinical characteristics; others used it without any particular theoretical premises and without any particular sense of responsibility. The difficulties in the way of diagnosis in certain cases could be reduced to two main factors: ignorance or insufficient knowledge of the patients' language and its nuances and the social and cultural characteristics of the level of their prewar life. Clinical psychiatry has hitherto restricted itself to describing the symptoms under each main classification as primary or secondary, but has had no or only very superficial explanations to offer of the psychical mechanism of the individual symptoms. The paranoid symptom is, as always, explained by the threat of homosexual-narcissistic components from the unconscious.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a relatively common form of psychotic disorder (severe mental illness). Its lifetime prevalence is nearly 1%, its annual incidence is about 10-15 per 100 000, and the average general practitioner cares for 10-20 schizophrenic patients depending on the location and social surroundings of the practice. It is a syndrome with various presentations and a variable, often relapsing, long term course. Although schizophrenia is publicly misconceived as \"split personality,\" the diagnosis has good reliability, even across ages and cultures, though there is no biochemical marker. Onset before the age of 30 is the norm, with men tending to present some four years younger than women. Clues as to aetiology are tantalising, and management remains endearingly clinical. Evidence for a genetic cause grows stronger: up to 50% of identical (monozygotic) twins will share a diagnosis, compared with about 15% of non-identical (dizygotic) twins. The strength of genetic factors varies across families, but some 10% of a patient's first degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) will also be schizophrenic, as will 50% of the children of two schizophrenic parents. Premorbid abnormalities of speech and behaviour may be present during childhood. The role of obstetric complications and viral infection in utero remains unproved. Enlarged ventricles and abnormalities of the temporal lobes are not uncommon findings from computed tomography of the brain. Thus, a picture is emerging of a genetic brain disorder, enhanced or brought out by subtle forms of environmental damage.

      "abstract": "Normal sexual function is a biopsychosocial process; sexual dysfunction almost always has organic and psychological components and requires multidisciplinary, goal-directed evaluation and treatment. Factors such as aging, declining testosterone levels, medical illness, certain medications. and comorbid depressive illness can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is one of the more common male sexual dysfunctions encountered in the clinical setting. Comorbidity between erectile dysfunction and depressive illness is high, but the causal relationship is unclear. The psychosocial distress that often accompanies erectile dysfunction might stimulate the development of depressive illness, or, as some data suggest, depression might cause erectile dysfunction. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction, as well as the design of a new study that may provide some answers, and concludes that erectile dysfunction is a common, treatable condition that may cause or be the result of depression. Recent data suggest that sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction in men with comorbid depression. Erectile dysfunction should be considered a multifactorial condition that may require a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, especially when depression is present.",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

Occasionally, OAB (or detrusor overactivity) may be the result of neurological disease, metabolic disease, or urinary tract abnormalities. Primary care practitioners can play a key role in identifying affected individuals by including a focused question in every annual patient physical assessment. Investigation and treatment can then be initiated, beginning with behavioral modification strategies (such as modifying fluid intake) and adding antimuscarinic pharmacotherapy or possibly local estrogen therapy where needed.

Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

      "abstract": "Summary An disorder is marked by extremes. It is present when a person experiences severe disturbances in behavior, such as extreme reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, or feelings of extreme distress or concern about body weight or shape. A person with an disorder may have started out just smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but at some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control. Eating disorders are very complex, and despite scientific research to understand them, the biological, behavioral and social underpinnings of these illnesses remain elusive. The two main types of disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third category is eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), which includes several variations of disorders. Eating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they can develop during childhood or later in adulthood. Women and girls are much more likely than males to develop an disorder. Men and boys account for an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients with anorexia or bulimia and an estimated 35 percent of those with binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses with complex underlying psychological and biological causes. They frequently co-exit with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. People with disorders also can suffer from numerous other physical health complications, such as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.",

Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy. Występowanie choroby w strukturze rodziny wywołuje liczne zmiany oraz wyrzeczenia ze strony jej członków.",

One possible explanation for this underrepresentation is that men frequently conceal or obscure their emotional difficulties as a consequence of masculine gender role socialization. Men who subscribe to traditional, Western masculine values may be inclined to hide, minimize, or otherwise have difficulty expressing their psychological suffering, rendering this suffering difficult for clinicians to observe, diagnose, and treat. This manuscript describes an approach to the assessment process with men that integrates clinical reports on assessment and psychotherapy with men, values pertaining to our culture's construction of traditional masculinity, and empirical findings on psychological disorders more commonly observed in men.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

However, in an undetermined percentage of them, culminating in the death of the subject without any objective findings postmortem to determine a definite etiology, so register as deaths subject to judicial autopsy.

A clear definition has, however, recently been agreed.1 The Rome consensus states that symptoms should be chronic and recurring and consist of abdominal pain that is clearly related to bowel function, being either relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool with or without disturbed defecation, which is defined as two or more of the following: altered stool frequency, altered stool form (hard, loose, or watery), altered stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete defecation), and passage of mucus. The above symptoms are usually associated with bloating or a sense of abdominal distension. The syndrome excludes painless constipation and diarrhoea and also chronic abdominal pain that is unrelated to bowel movement in which psychiatric features predominate.\n\nIrritable bowel symptoms are experienced by 8-22% of the population,2 but most learn to cope with their symptoms and less than one third actually consult a doctor.

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "title": "Menstrual Psychosis with Premenstrual Onset: A case presentation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Menstrual psychosis has an acute onset and is characterised by confusion, stupor and mutism, delusions, hallucinations, or a manic syndrome lasting for a brief duration, with full recovery. These symptoms maintain periodicity in rhythm with the menstrual cycle. The symptoms may appear in the premenstrual phase or may begin with the onset of menstrual flow (catamenial psychoses). Usually, menstrual psychosis has a polymorphism of both psychotic and affective symptoms (Brockington I. Menstrual psychosis. World Psychiatry. 2005;4(1):9-17.). In this article we present a case of menstrual psychosis with premenstrual onset. Objectives A 26 years old, nulliparous single female with one mentally ill relative on her mother’s side (her grandmother) presented with an episodic illness characterized by mood swings, irrelevant speech, irritability, suspiciousness and thought disorder related to her menstrual cycles. She had earlier suffered prolonged attacks of mania, developed a recurrent episodic illness which returned every month for five years. Her menses began at 15. She presented with the history of a few episodes of manic illness starting five days before and ending suddenly with the onset of the menses. Methods On mental status evaluation during the index episode, the patient was agitated, had labile affect, grandiose and referential delusions and erotomania. A detailed physical examination, routine biochemistry, and gonadal hormonal assay were unremarkable. Results She was started on olanzapine 10 mg/day, lithium 1200 mg/day and low-dose clonazepam. Although the severity of the psychotic and affective symptoms gradually reduced during the future menstrual cycles, they did not completely resolve. Conclusions The pathophysiology of menstrual psychosis is not exactly understood, but it has been postulated that fluctuation of the sex hormones occurring during the menstrual cycle is responsible. Previous studies have reported the association of psychosis with estrogen withdrawal (Mahé V, Dumaine A. Oestrogen withdrawal associated psychoses. Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2001;104(5):323-331.). Treatment strategies for menstrual psychosis include the use of oral contraceptive pills for the regulation of hormones during the menstrual cycle, in our case patient did not want to use oral contraceptive pills.

      "abstract": "This paper does not attempt to review the whole topic of clinical efficacy but will consider general concepts, particularly in the light of the advent of the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The aetiology of depression is complex. In most cases there is some form of predisposition based on problematical family dynamics, disordered family communication and/or genetic factors; each may be present to a variable extent. On top of this predisposition, some form of stimulus - ‘stress’, an external problem, loss of control, a physical disorder, adverse life circumstances - appears to affect those who are already primed. There are a variety of possible outcomes from this combination of predisposition and stimuli: low mood, depression in the full syndromic sense, and depression with biological features. It seems likely that, particularly with severe depressions (the major syndromic forms and those with biological features), there are neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes to mediate the effects of stress into those of the clinical symptoms and signs. It has been hypothesised that stressors induce adaptive neurochemical changes, failure of which may engender behavioural disturbances (Anisman &amp; Zacharko, 1992). However, there are also many individuals who may not undergo this process, but who probably have some cognitive or learned change leading to dysphoria; this aspect needs to be considered carefully in relation to efficacy.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder has one or more symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a neurological or other medical condition, but they are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies. Individuals with conversion disorder do not intentionally produce or feign their symptoms. Instead, the symptoms are due to an unconscious expression of a psychological conflict or need. There might be associated primary and secondary gains which act as maintaining factors. The disorder is more common in adolescence than in childhood. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old male reported to the Emergency Department alleged history of fall from a 10 feet wall c/o neck pain, inability to move all 4 limbs, diminished sensation below the neck. Cervical immobilization was done and his vitals & routine blood investigations were found to be normal. No signs of any urinary retention or fecal incontinence. Routine neurological examination was performed which revealed hypotonia in all 4 limbs with flaccidity with a power of 0/5 and diminished sensation at the level of C3. Neuro imaging was done. MRI brain with cervical screening revealed no edema, cord compression. MRI CERVICAL SPINE – NORMAL. Stressor: He was convicted under POSCO act for 3 years, 2 days before the incident. Neurosurgeon ruled out the physical cause of the above presentation. Detailed history revealed he was being convicted for 3 years for a marrying a 17 years old girl with her consent under POSCO act 2 days prior to the incident. He was seen distressed after hearing the verdict, had sleep disturbances, remained aloof, not communicating with others. He attempted suicide by jumping from the wall. He had a history of occasional cannabis use for the past 2 years. Family history revealing possession attacks in his mother. He was raised by a single parent as his father left him and his mother when he was 5 years old. He had no episodes of similar illness in the past. His temperament revealed that he had difficulty in adjustment to the situations being impulsive and had self-injurious behavior. Mental status examination revealed that the patient was lying in supine position, not able to move his all 4 limbs with obvious psychomotor retardation decreased talks, sad mood. DISCUSSION: The clinical picture is indicative of Dissociative Motor Disorder F44.4 according to ICD 10. After taking a detailed history, it was clear that he was extremely distressed regarding his punishment under POSCO act as he willfully married a 17 years old girl with her consent which could not stand in the court of law. Patient was started on therapy sessions as well as low-dose diazepam. In the sessions, possible causes of these symptoms were discussed, his family members were also psycho-educated about the psychosomatic nature of the symptoms and advised to encourage him for a symptom-free lifestyle. They were also given an instruction not to pay attention to his complaints of physical nature. Psychotherapy sessions were started in which all her stressors were therapy discussed. CONCLUSION: Conversion disorder, somatoform disorder, and malingering always remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinicians. The prompt history taking, identification of stressors, use of appropriate and validated physical examination manoeuvres, and coordination of care and information exchange between all family members and medical team may facilitate the expeditious care of these patients in a cost-effective manner. Psychogenic symptoms should be treated using suggestions, patience, and reassurance. Early recognition of a conversion disorder will limit unnecessary tests and medications. The quality of doctor-patient relationship can influence outcome. The existing literature supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach, with specific interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy for cognitive restructuring and psychodynamic therapy for addressing symptom connections to trauma and dissociation.",

The sequelae of therapist‐client sex may form a distinct syndrome, with similarities to Rape Response Syndrome, Battered Spouse Syndrome, reaction to incest, response to child abuse, and Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder. Aspects of Therapist‐Patient Sex Syndrome include: (a) ambivalence, (b) a sense of guilt, (c) feelings of emptiness and isolation, (d) sexual confusion, (e) impaired ability to trust, (f) identity, boundary, and role confusion, (g) emotional lability (frequently involving severe depression and acute anxiety), (k) suppressed rage, (i) increased suicidal risk, and (j) cognitive dysfunction (especially in the areas of attention and concentration, frequently involving flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and unbidden images).",

Although convulsive SE is recognized as a medical emergency, prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with NCSE is often not emphasized because its consequences are thought to be benign. We report 10 patients with persistent neurologic deficits or death after well-documented NCSE in the form of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

There are no specific sets of symptoms; it tends to vary considerably from one person to another and also to be distant in time. As well as a range of different physical symptoms, multiple sclerosis can also cause a wide variety of mental and emotional disturbances. Psychosis in multiple sclerosis, while not common, does occur in approximately 5% of cases, although it is probably under reported. Neurological changes, alterations in brain chemistry or severe stress such as that brought on by diagnosis or the impact of multiple sclerosis, can lead to the development of psychosis Psychosis may also occur as a result of treatment with steroids or other drugs. The duration and intensity of the psychotic episode can be variable, ranging from mild loss of contact with reality, to severe loss of a grasp on reality, with full delusional episodes; to complete catatonia. We present a case report of a patient diagnosed with Multiple Scleroses that presents psychotic symptoms as early symptomatology of the disease, independently of steroid and other specifically medication.",

(2) The Catatonic Syndrome, probably the inhibitory phase of dementia praæcox. (3) The Uninhibited or Kinetic Syndrome, probably the excited phase of dementia præcox. (4) The Non-Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably also a phase or form of dementia præcox. (5) The Euphoric Manic Syndrome, which is probably the underlying condition in the manic form of manic-depressive insanity. (6) The Delusional Hallucinatory Syndrome, also a factor in dementia præcox. (7) The Syndrome of Constitutional Hereditary Depression, which indicates an hereditary factor that attacks the controlling mechanism of emotional life or heightens emotivity, but leaves the cognitive general factor untouched. (8) The Syndrome of Retarded Depression, which is not as yet clearly differentiated. (3) Reasons are given for regarding these syndromes as neurological defects of a definite nature.

Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The aim of this article is to review recent epidemiological research on age-of-onset of mental disorders, focusing on the WHO World Mental Health surveys. Recent findings Median and inter-quartile range (IQR; 25th–75th percentiles) of age-of-onset is much earlier for phobias (7–14, IQR 4–20) and impulse–control disorders (7–15; IQR 4–35) than other anxiety disorders (25–53, IQR 15–75), mood disorders (25–45, IQR 17–65), and substance disorders (18–29, IQR 16–43). Although less data exist for nonaffective psychosis, available evidence suggests that median age-of-onset is in the range late teens through early 20s. Roughly half of all lifetime mental disorders in most studies start by the mid-teens and three quarters by the mid-20s. Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe disorders that are seldom brought to clinical attention. Summary First onset of mental disorders usually occur in childhood or adolescence, although treatment typically does not occur until a number of years later. Although interventions with early incipient disorders might help reduce severity-persistence of primary disorders and prevent secondary disorders, additional research is needed on appropriate treatments for early incipient cases and on long-term evaluation of the effects of early intervention on secondary prevention.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is the ultimate union of mind and body; sexual functioning or dysfunction depends on complex bio-psycho-social conditions. Sexual dysfunction (SD) may be primarily due to physical disorders, including endocrinologic (diabetes, androgen deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), cardiovascular and pelvic illnesses. SD can be secondary or indirectly related to impairments of the physical disorder such as fatigue, weakness and bladder incontinence, or to the psychosocial stress of the illness. Not only the disease itself, but the treatment prescribed, may also cause sexual impairment. SD is prevalent among psychiatric patients and maybe related to both the psychopathology and the psychopharmacology. SD has been reported in as many as 30%-60% of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic medication, up to 78% of individuals with depression treated with antidepressants and up to 80% in patients suffering from anxiety disorder. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with SD. Psychosocial factors, like interpersonal relationships, length of relationship, lifestyle, socioeconomic class and cultural background have been shown to correlate with SD, especially in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. An evaluation of SD should take into consideration the primary sexual functioning, the physical and mental disorders, the various medications and the psychosocial factors. It is recommended to identify the specific cause of the SD and to treat the patient according to the individual's mental disorder, physical disorder and interpersonal relationship.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) (100% of affected individuals), generalized epilepsy (~84%), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral abnormalities (≤50%). To date more than 50 individuals with SYNGAP1-ID have been reported. In the majority DD/ID was moderate to severe; in some it was mild. The epilepsy is generalized; a subset of individuals with epilepsy have myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) or epilepsy with myoclonic absences. Behavioral abnormalities can include stereotypic behaviors (e.g., hand flapping, obsessions with certain objects) as well as poor social development. Feeding difficulties can be significant in some. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SYNGAP1-ID is established in a proband with developmental delay or intellectual disability in whom molecular genetic testing identifies either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SYNGAP1 (~89%) or a deletion of 6p21.3 (~11%). Management Treatment of manifestations: DD/ID are managed as per standard practice. No guidelines are available regarding choice of specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In about 50% of patients, the epilepsy responds to a single antiepileptic drug (AED); in the remainder it is pharmacoresistant. Children may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of ASD. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician may guide parents through appropriate behavioral management strategies and/or provide prescription medications when necessary. Nasogastric/gastrostomy feeding may be required for individuals with persistent feeding issues. Surveillance: Monitor seizure manifestations and control; behavioral issues; developmental progress and educational needs. Genetic counseling SYNGAP1-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date almost all probands with SYNGAP1-ID whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have had a de novo germline pathogenic variant; however, vertical transmission (from a mildly affected, mosaic parent to the proband) has been reported in one family. Thus, while the risk to sibs appears to be low, it is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent. Once the SYNGAP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Sufferers may not seek professional help, may receive incorrect diagnoses, or have symptoms of anxiety confused with medical complaints, especially cardiac complaints (Leon et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2005). While both men and women with anxiety disorders often receive suboptimal treatment, this is especially true for women. Women are more likely to receive benzodiazepines and are less likely to avail themselves of other effective pharmacological or psychological treatments (van der Waals et al. 1993). Moreover, women are more likely than men to suffer with anxiety disorders (NCS-R 2007). In this chapter we will present epidemiological data on specific anxiety disorders in women.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms may be presenting  features of an Addisonian crisis or may be presented in patients with  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) or Hashimoto encephalopathy; that these  disorders are associated with primary adrenal insufficiency (AI). Nearly 5%  of individuals with autoimmune AD develop pernicious anemia. X-linked  ALD (X-ALD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder; a frequent but  under-recognized cause of primary adrenocortical insufficiency. The classic  picture of Vitamin B12 deficiency is subacute combined degeneration of  the dorsal (posterior) and lateral spinal columns. The neuropathy is  symmetrical, affects the legs more than the arms. It begins with paresthesia  and ataxia and can progress to severe weakness, spasticity, paraplegia, even  fecal, and urinary incontinence. We report a case of autoimmune AI who  had presented with some neurologic symptoms. The challenging point was  differentiating between X-ALD and other neurological syndromes that have  an association with AI. We report a case of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency who had presented with some neurologic symptoms. The challenging point was differentiating between X-ALD and other neurological syndromes associating with adrenal insufficiency.",

      "title": "Venlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",
      "abstract": "RET, Revista de Toxicomanias. No. 13 – 1997 La fobia social, uno de los trastornos de ansiedad definidos en el DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 1994); es comun entre la poblacion general. El trastorno se caracteriza por el miedo a hacer alguna cosa o actuar de manera que pueda resultar embarazosa o a ser juzgado o evaluado por los demas. Entre las situaciones fobicas comunes se incluye hablar en publico, comer frente a otros, firmar, ser presentado a extranos o utilizar urinarios publicos. Los episodios de ansiedad pueden ser similares a las crisis de angustia, y muchos de los sujetos evitan las situaciones que les generan ansiedad. Los datos de prevalencia de la fobia social sugieren una prevalencia a lo largo de la vida desde el 3 5% (Schneier y col. 1992b) hasta el 11-15% (Kessler y col. 1994). Estos datos muestran que la fobia social compite en frecuencia con los problemas mas comunmente tratados en el entorno psiquiatrico. El pico de edad de inicio se situa en la adolescencia y primera juventud. Las personas con fobia social se ven afectadas significativamente por varios factores familiares, sociales y ocupacionales particularmente a esa edad, pero tambien a lo largo de la vida adulta. La fobia social (Schneier y col. 1992b) puede ir asociada a comorbilidad significativa, como un aumento de la depresion o el consumo de alcohol o drogas y una disminucion de la calidad de vida. La fobia social responde a varios tratamientos farmacologicos, incluyendo los inhibidores de la monoamino oxidasa (IMAOs) (Liebowitz y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992), las benzodiacepinas (Davidson y col. 1991; Ontiveros y Fontaine 1990), y los ISRSs (Black y col. 1992; Schneier y col. 1992b, Sternbach 1990), asi como a la terapia cognitivo-conductual (Marks 1985). De los tratamientos farmacologicos, los IMAOs fenelzina y moclobemida son los que mas se han estudiado (Liebowith y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992). Los IMAOs bloquean la degradacion de todas las monoaminas pero requieren restricciones en la dieta que algunos pacientes consideran dificiles de seguir o que les asustan. Todas estas medicaciones interactuan con los sistemas serotoninergico, dopaminergico, noradrenergico o del acido gamma-amino-butirico. Existe una interaccion significativa entre estos sistemas y actualmente no esta claro cuales estan involucrados en la fobia social. En muchos aspectos, el perfil mixto de recaptacion de la venlafaxina parece ofrecer varias de las ventajas teraVenlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",

      "title": "Treatment of Female Endocrinopathies",
      "abstract": "THE endocrine glands have, since first discovered, offered a very perplexing problem to the clinician both in diagnosis and therapy. Rapid strides have been made in the understanding of the function of the various glands and their interaction, but this is far from complete. Knowledge of the glands which control the female sex function is perhaps more advanced than in any other field of endocrinology and many of the functional disorders of the female are recognized as glandular in origin. But the mechanism of this complex function has not been sufficiently demonstrated so as to serve as a basis of specific therapy. The identity and individuality of some of the hormones have not been determined, and in many cases it has not been proven which hormones cause certain reactions. Also, endocrine disorders are not the result of the lack of or the over-abundance of a single hormone with complete normalcy of the other glands. The abnormal function of one gland is usually accompanied by decreased function in some of the other glands of the endocrine system, with compensatory hyperactivity of still others, depending upon the normal interaction of the glands. For these reasons organotherapy is not sufficient in treating functional disorders of the female, though we have some of the hormones in pure form and in potent concentration. We have, therefore, sought some other means of treating the cases which might more nearly relieve the cause of the disorder than glandular products which are purely substitutional in action. We refer to irradiation of the pituitary gland. This method of treatment is not very recent; however, it has been used more extensively in Europe than in this country. It was introduced by Hofbauer (1), in 1922, before the German Gynecological Congress. Rubin (2, 3), in 1926, and Kaplan (4) reported the use of x-ray therapy to the ovaries and to the pituitary gland in cases of amenorrhea and functional sterility. Ford (6) and Drips (5), in 1928, and Collins et al. (7), in 1936, found irradiation helpful in relieving the symptoms associated with the menopause. Recently (1935), Newell and Pettit (8) reported excellent results in cases of functional dysmenorrhea treated with pituitary irradiation. Mazer and Spitz (9), in 1935, found irradiation helpful in the functional menstrual disorders. In using x-ray to the pituitary gland we make no pretense of explaining its method of action. We have found that it is effective, which must be sufficient for the time being: no one as yet really knows how it works. This is attested to by the fact that there is such a wide divergence of opinion as to its modus operandi. Some able clinicians say that all x-ray is destructive, hence irradiation can be beneficial only when there is a state of hyperfunction, and reduction of the activity of the gland is indicated.",

      "abstract": "Excoriation (Skin-Picking) disorder is a clinically recognized condition which was recently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) - fifth edition, as OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) related disorder. The disorder's official status has been achieved due to its high frequency and unique clinical picture involving both mental and physical impairment. In this article, we would like to present a concise review of the literature together with an illustrative case. Epidemiological surveys show a prevalence of 3% to 5% for the general population, with heterogeneous gender and age distribution. In recent years the disorder has been categorized under the family of BFRB's (Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours). However, there are some elements associated with movement suppression and tic disorders, as well as disorders belonging to obsessive-compulsive spectrum. The treatment of this disorder may be pharmacological and/or psychological. There is some evidence for the benefit of some SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) agents as well as for N-Acetyl-Cysteine. Various psychological treatments have been investigated and some of them have proven to be effective. These include cognitive behavioural protocols, some of which have been developed specifically for this disorder.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

Pain disrupts sleep continuity and quality via many different mechanisms, and conversely, poor sleep, short sleep, and prolonged sleep, can amplify chronic pain, in an often bi-directional relationship. These interactions relate to numerous disorders causing chronic pain, and are not necessarily specific to any particular one.

Typically, compulsive sexual behaviors are characterized by the failure to resist the urge for a given sexual behavior, which is frequently followed by feelings of guilt, regret, and self-reproach, leading to their inclusion in the spectrum of impulse control disorders. The treatment of compulsive sexual behaviors is challenging, with reports of varying success for several psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics.",

Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence.

This leaves patients with a double problem – presence of these symptoms and inability to obtain help or hope for their evaluation or treatment. This tragedy has been averted in many patients based upon biochemical and clinical studies in which these symptoms were evaluated, their etiologies defined (related to biochemical changes in several body functions) and, based upon these evaluations, effective treatment initiated to correct these dysfunctions.

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a recurring cyclical disorder that encompasses a variety of emotional and physical symptoms that appear in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Overall, approximately 75% of the women with regular cycles complain of some premenstrual symptoms. Emotional symptoms include emotional hypersensitivity, depression, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, tension, fear of loss of control, and confusion. Somatic complaints include feelings of bloating, body aches, breast tenderness, headaches, food cravings, and poor coordination. The etiology of PMS is still largely unknown, but current research suggests that serotonin may be important in its pathogenesis. Although the underlying cause remains unclear, significant progress has been made in treatment of symptoms. If presenting symptoms are mild, infrequent, or of short duration, use of nonpharmacologic approaches such as dietary modification, exercise, support, and stress reduction are suggested. This paper examines the dietary modifications that have recently been studied, some of which may offer relief from certain premenstrual symptoms. The current literature indicates that increased carbohydrate, calcium, manganese, and magnesium intake can decrease certain symptoms of PMS. However, recent studies do not indicate a clear role for sodium, caffeine, or vitamin B6 in alleviating symptoms.",

Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are the most common type of functional neurological symptom disorders and are frequently diagnosed in tertiary care epilepsy monitoring units. These are associated with significant decline in social functioning and quality of life. The majority of patients with PNES are women, outnumbering men by a ratio of 3:1. Female sex preponderance occurs after puberty and usually before the age of 55 years. Many of the psychiatric risk factors in PNES (depression, anxiety, history of traumatic experiences, other somatic symptom disorders) are more common in women and may partially account for the difference in sex prevalence. Neurobiological and neurohumoral mechanisms may also play a role, but our understanding is limited at this point. In this review, we present information on epidemiology and risk factors, neurobiological and psychological mechanisms, clinical approach to diagnosis, evidence-based treatment, and long-term outcomes. We highlight findings related to differences between women and men in PNES. Most of these data are not decisive and require further corroboration. While the disorder may be more frequently suspected in women, all patients with suspected PNES deserve an objective and thorough investigation of their symptoms. Early and accurate identification of this disorder should be a priority, especially as evidence-based treatments, which may lead to improved outcomes, are increasingly available.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

      "abstract": "A Disfunção temporomandibular (DTM) é um termo que engloba uma série dedisfunções e desordens que afetam a (ATM) e/ ou os músculos mastigatórios. Os sinais esintomas são variáveis, no entanto, os três principais são dor, limitação da abertura de boca, esons na articulação temporomandibular. A dor é geralmente a queixa principal (LERESCHE,1997). A DTM e dor orofacial acometem preferencialmente mulheres em idade reprodutiva(BOVE; GUIMARÃES; SMITH, 2005). Ainda não foi identificada uma causa isolada euniversal para explicar o desenvolvimento da DTM, de forma que a sua etiologia éconsiderada multifatorial envolvendo fatores físicos e psicológicos (Carrara et al., 2010). Osfatores psicológicos envolvidos nas desordens temporomandibulares estão sendo cada vezmais estudados e discutidos e podem ser divididos em emocionais (ansiedade, depressão eestresse) e fatores cognitivos (expectativas e significados quanto à sensação de dor(CESTARI; CAMPARIS, 2002). Tem sido observado que pessoas expostas a fatoresestressantes comumente demonstram um aumento de hiperatividade do músculo masseter(CESTARI; CAMPARIS, 2002). Em outros estudos já foi demonstrado que a depressão e acatastrofização da dor contribuem para o aparecimento e persistência de DTM (VELLY;LOOK; ; SCHIFFMAN , 2010;VELLY; LOOK; CARLSON, 2011). Indivíduos com dorrelacionada à DTM apresentam maiores níveis de estresse, ansiedade, depressão, somatizaçãoe pensamentos catastróficos em comparação a indivíduos saudáveis (MACFARLANE;,KENEALY; KINGDON, 2009; (DE LEEUW et al., 2005; CARLSON, 2007;MANFREDINI; LANDI; BANDETTINI DI POGGIO A, 2003; VISSCHER; OHRBACH;VAN WIJK, 2010).

Diese konnten sich bisher nur auf nicht überprüfte Vermutungen stützen. Inzwischen liegen aus mehreren Instituten unfallmechanische Untersuchungen von naturgetreuen Auffahrunfällen mit Zusammenprall von rückwärts, von vorne und von der Seite vor. Dabei wurden die Bewegungsabläufe mit einer Hochgeschwindigkeitsvideokamera unter gleichzeitiger elektronischer Erfassung anderer, wichtiger Parameter erfasst. Übereinstimmend hat sich gezeigt, dass die gesamte Crashphase etwa 3/10 s dauert und dass ein Schleudermechanismus tatsächlich nicht stattfindet. Das sog. Syndrom der Spätfolgen nach Schleudertrauma ist uncharakteristisch. Eine gleichartige Symptomatik wird bei verschiedenen Befindlichkeitsstörungen beobachtet, deren nosologische Stellung zweifelhaft ist. In vielen Fällen sind die somatischen, emotionalen und kognitiven Beschwerden Ausdruck von Depressivität. Der „zervikale Schwindel” ist nach Ansicht von Experten eine zweifelhafte Entität. „Zervikaler Nystagmus” ist auch bei Gesunden auslösbar. Viele der von einigen Autoren lebhaft propagierten neurootologischen Untersuchungsmethoden sind in ihrer Ausführung nicht standardisiert. Die Auswertung der Ergebnisse ist nicht statistisch belegt. Neuropsychologische Testuntersuchungen können dazu dienen, erhaltene und beeinträchtigte kognitive Leistungen zu beschreiben, nicht aber, Hirngeschädigte in einer unausgelesenen Population zu identifizieren. Manualmedizinische Befunde sind stark subjektiv gefärbt. Die beschriebenen nuklearmedizinischen Veränderungen werden auch bei Depression ohne vorangegangenes Trauma erhoben. Die Veränderungen in der MRT, mit denen traumatische Einrisse der Ligamenta alaria belegt werden sollten, sind in gleicher Art auch bei Gesunden festzustellen. Für die Begutachtung sind national und international klare Regeln erarbeitet worden.",

      "abstract": "The first part of this paper deals with the psychological background to the most common difficulties in the relation between doctors and patients, particularly when the two parties disagree about the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a psychosomatic affection. The following causes for discord are discussed:Alexithymia—a mental deficiency that obstructs the insight into the connection between emotional and physical reactions to all types of life experiences;Anal object relationships—a disturbance of the psychosexual development in early childhood, involving in particular the risk of a destructive struggle for power between the patient and the doctor;Regression—the return to a more infantile stage of behaviour in a person who had once passed that stage, involving the risk of mistrust and hatred from the patient towards a doctor whom he conceives as coldhearted and repudiating;Gain of illness—unconscious psychic defence mechanisms that are often misunderstood and may lead the unwise and unsuspecting doctor to fateful errors of treatment and management.The second part describes the tactics for a fruitful cooperation between doctor and patient in regard to the investigation and management of gastrointestinal complaints, possibly originating from psychosomatic reactions to stress and other psychological and social strains.Before the diagnosis is made, it is essential to pursue in parallel two lines of investigation—the somatic and the psychosocial—to avoid one line impeding advances along the other.When a thorough somatic examination has made it clear that the patient's complaints are not caused by an organic disease and the patient's search for a psychosomatic connection has not yet been successful, the so-called redirectional work remains. An account of this work and plain rules for its accomplishment are given.",

Caso Clinico. Se expone el caso de una mujer adulta joven, con antecedentes por abuso sexual infantil, que desarrollo a partir de la adolescencia temprana fantasias sexuales recurrentes, de contenido exclusivamente masoquista. Tras la implementacion de psicoterapia ambulatoria, se evidencio una reduccion parcial de esta psicopatologia a nivel cognitivo, abandonando la paciente las relaciones sexuales sadomasoquistas que comportaban un potencial lesivo. Conclusiones. El masoquismo sexual representado por fantasias y conductas recurrentes, restrictivas, incontrolables y potencialmente lesivas reviste significacion clinica. El abuso sexual infantil se erige en un factor de riesgo para este subgrupo de sujetos masoquistas.

We present a rare case of multiple erotomanic delusions in a man hailing from Southern India. He has lived with this condition for the past 5 years and has been nonresponsive to antipsychotics. The behavior of such patients can lead to the social embarrassment of friends and family. Serious cases in men also result in violence, although this is very rare.

It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "abstract": "An orgasm in the human female is a variable, transient peak sensation of intense pleasure, creating an altered state of consciousness, usually with an initiation accompanied by involuntary, rhythmic contractions of the pelvic striated circumvaginal musculature, often with concomitant uterine and anal contractions, and myotonia that resolves the sexually induced vasocongestion and myotonia, generally with an induction of well-being and contentment. Women's orgasms can be induced by erotic stimulation of a variety of genital and nongenital sites. As of yet, no definitive explanations for what triggers orgasm have emerged. Studies of brain imaging indicate increased activation at orgasm, compared to pre-orgasm, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray of the midbrain, hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Psychosocial factors commonly discussed in relation to female orgasmic ability include age, education, social class, religion, personality, and relationship issues. Findings from surveys and clinical reports suggest that orgasm problems are the second most frequently reported sexual problems in women. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for anorgasmia focuses on promoting changes in attitudes and sexually relevant thoughts, decreasing anxiety, and increasing orgasmic ability and satisfaction. To date there are no pharmacological agents proven to be beneficial beyond placebo in enhancing orgasmic function in women.",

Spasms are thought to be of such a psychological nature. In the vagina, these spasms can cause vaginitis, whereas at the neck of the uterus and in the fallopian tubes they obstruct the passage of the sperm. A psychological disorder can also cause the alteration of the date of ovulation through its effects on enzyme and hormonal levels and may suppress it altogether. Therapy for psychologically related sterility must comprise 3 elements: a systematic search for some kind of somatic etiology, a simple psychotherapy within every practitioner's reach, and the patient's confidence in her gynecologist. In the case of those women who have been undergoing psychotherapy for a prolonged period of time, termination of the therapy may give surprising results.",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "It has become increasingly apparent that women suffer a disproportionate amount of pain during their lifetime compared to men. Over the past 15 years, a growing number of studies have suggested a variety of causes for this sex difference, from cellular to psychosocial levels of analysis. From a biological perspective, sexual differentiation of pain appears to occur similarly to sexual differentiation of other phenomena: it results in large part from organizational and activational effects of gonadal steroid hormones. The focus of this review is the activational effects of a single group of ovarian hormones, the estrogens, on pain in humans and animals. The effects of estrogens (estradiol being the most commonly examined) on experimentally induced acute pain vs. clinical pain are summarized. For clinical pain, the review is limited to a few syndromes for which there is considerable evidence for estrogenic involvement: migraine, temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and arthritis. Because estrogens can modulate the function of the nervous, immune, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems, estrogenic modulation of pain is an exceedingly complex, multi-faceted phenomenon, with estrogens producing both pro- and antinociceptive effects that depend on the extent to which each of these systems of the body is involved in a particular type of pain. Forging a more complete understanding of the myriad ways that estrogens can ameliorate vs. facilitate pain will enable us to better prevent and treat pain in both women and men.",

PMDD is distinguished from PMS by the severity of symptoms, predominance of mood symptoms, and role dysfunction, particularly in personal relationships and marital/family domains. Several treatment modalities are beneficial in PMDD and severe PMS, but the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as first-line therapy. The SSRIs can be administered continuously throughout the entire month, intermittently from ovulation to the onset of menstruation, or semi-intermittently with dosage increases during the late luteal phase. These guidelines present practical treatment algorithms for the use of SSRIs in women with pure PMDD or severe PMS, PMDD and underlying subsyndromal clinical features of mood or anxiety, or premenstrual exacerbation of a mood/anxiety disorder.",

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse.

Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

In most cases, it is benign and disappearswithin six weeks, but approximately 20% of individualswith lumbar pain do not show any improvement in theircondition, which may progress to chronic low back pain.This chronic condition is difficult to manage and iscorrelated with many mechanical alterations (3).Maintenance of postural balance under static or dynamicconditions is essential for any functional activity (4). Inindividuals with chronic low back pain, the degree of controlmay change such that performing daily tasks becomescompromised and the chronic nature of the disease issustained (4-7). The mechanisms that lead to such abnorm-alities of postural control remain unclear. Pain is animportant factor in mechanical and neural alterations, butthe extent to which it influences postural balance still cannotbe determined. One of the hypotheses of this study is that thegreater the lumbar pain and physical disability, the worse thepatient’s maintenance of both static and dynamic posture.Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate thecorrelations between lumbar pain and the degree of disabilityand postural balance among women with chronic low backpain.",

This holds in particular for anxiety and (manifest or suppressed) anger. The psychic manifestations of distress are accompanied by a host of hormonal, autonomic and immunological alterations (Chapter 8).

Psychische Wirkungen sind unter anderem eine allgemeine Enthemmung, eine erhoehte Reizbarkeit bis zur Aggressivitaet und eine Einschraenkung des Kritikvermoegens. Physische Wirkungen betreffen das Sehvermoegen, das Hoervermoegen, die Reaktion und das Kleinhirn, was sich in Gleichgewichts- und Bewegungsstoerungen aeussert. Alkoholwirkungen sind in hohem Masse von der Alkoholgewoehnung und der Gesamtbefindlichkeit abhaengig. Generell wirkt Ethanol auf das Zentralnervensystem daempfend. Unter Alkoholeinfluss sind gehaeuft Fahrfehler wie Schlangenlinienfahren, Geradeausfahren in Kurven, Auffahren auf stehende Fahrzeuge oder Hindernisse sowie inadaequate und Fehlreaktionen auf ueberraschende und komplexere Verkehrssituationen zu beobachten.

      "title": "Postpartale psychische Störungen - ein unterschätztes Problem in der Geburtshilfe",
      "abstract": "Die postpartalen psychischen Störungen lassen sich im Wesentlichen drei Gruppen zuordnen: Dem so genannten \"Baby Blues\", der Wochenbettdepression und der Wochenbettpsychose. Der etwa 3 - 5 Tage nach Entbindung auftretende Baby Blues kommt nach 50 - 70 % aller Geburten vor und klingt nach etwa einer Woche ohne weitere Therapie meist folgenlos ab. Allerdings entwickeln 20 - 30 % dieser Frauen im weiteren Wochenbettverlauf eine Depression, weshalb bei über 2 Wochen post partum persistierenden Bluessymptomen eine genauere Exploration hinsichtlich einer Depression zu empfehlen ist. Wochenbettdepressionen betreffen 10 - 15 % aller Entbundenen; sie treten meist mehrere Wochen bis Monate nach Entbindung in Form einer depressiven Verstimmung mit Schlafstörungen, Ängstlichkeit, Antriebsmangel, Interessenverlust und Schuldgefühlen bis hin zu Selbstmordgedanken auf. Um sie nicht als Babyblues fehlzudeuten, sind gezielte Fragen nach der Stimmungslage der jungen Mutter bei der Untersuchung 6 Wochen post partum, ggfs. unter Anwendung der Edinburgh-Skala zu empfehlen. Patientinnen mit bekannten Risikofaktoren für die Entwicklung einer Wochenbettdepression (Z.n. Wochenbettdepression oder Wochenbettpsychose, depressive Erkrankung, Angsterkrankung, bipolare Erkrankung) bedürfen einer engmaschigen Überwachung und ggfs. einer prophylaktischen Behandlung in Kooperation mit dem Psychiater. Leichtere Formen der Wochenbettdepression sind ambulant mit psychotherapeutischen und soziotherapeutischen Maßnahmen meist gut zu behandeln. Bei schwereren Verläufen sind Antidepressiva (selektive Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) oder bestimmte Trizyklika) indiziert. Postpartale Angst- und Zwangsstörungen sprechen gut auf Psychotherapie an; bei Angsterkrankungen werden außerdem Benzodiazepine, bei Zwangserkrankungen SSRI empfohlen. Wochenbettpsychosen (ca. 0,1 - 0,2 %) treten vermehrt bei bekannter bipolarer oder schizoaffektiver Störung bzw. bei Z.n. Wochenbettpsychose auf. Sie müssen vor allem wegen der Gefahr des erweiterten Suizids stationär behandelt werden; idealerweise erfolgt dies in interdisziplinären Mutter-Kind-Einheiten.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the diagnostic criteria for hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo to be included in the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD). The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

The major clinical finding is the frequent co-occurrence of anxiety disorder with depression. Approximately half of the patients with poststroke anxiety disorder were found to have major depression and about one-third minor depression. The second clinical finding is that the clinical and pathological correlates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder are different. For example, the duration of anxiety disorder and depression are different. Anxiety but not depression is associated with prior alcohol abuse, acute onset anxiety but not acute onset depression is associated with right hemisphere lesion location, and anxiety and depression have independent or sometimes additive effects on recovery of activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive functioning, and social functioning.",

In youth, these intrusion symptoms often manifest as repetitive play, frightening dreams without recognizable content, and trauma-specific re-enactment during play. Youth who have PTSD may also experience persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma (Criterion C), negative alterations in cognitions and moods (Criterion D), and hyperarousal and reactivity, often with little or no provocation (Criterion E). There are some minor differences in the diagnostic criteria for children younger than six years of age (e.g., fewer symptoms needed for diagnosis), and all symptoms must be considered in the context of the individual’s developmental stage and in light of pre-trauma functioning.",

      "abstract": "Neurologische Patienten und Angstpatienten weisen deutliche storungsspezifische\r\nUnterschiede innerhalb ihres Besserungsverlaufes auf.\r\nZusammenfassend lasst sich sagen, dass sich neurologische Patienten hinsichtlich\r\nihrer neurologischen Symptomatik nur wenig besserten, jedoch die Depressivitat\r\nsowie der Allgemeinzustand nach sechs Wochen stationarer Verhaltenstherapie eine\r\ndeutliche Verbesserung aufwiesen.\r\nDabei besserte sich die Depressivitat im Vergleich zu den Angstpatienten weder\r\nlangsamer noch geringer. Am Ende des Aufenthaltes zeigten die neurologischen\r\nPatienten sogar eine signifikant geringer ausgepragte depressive Symptomatik. Der\r\nGesamteindruck der neurologischen Patienten scheint mehr durch die komorbiden\r\nStorungen als durch Anderungen der neurologischen Symptomatik beeinflusst zu\r\nwerden, wohingegen das allgemeine Storungsbild der Angstpatienten durch die\r\nAngstreduktion bestimmt zu werden scheint.\r\nDie Depressivitat der neurologischen Patienten erscheint nicht organisch bedingt,\r\nsondern tritt vielmehr als Form einer Anpassungsstorung auf; als ein Ausdruck von\r\nmangelnden Bewaltigungsstrategien bzw. von Hilflosigkeit der neurologischen\r\nErkrankung gegenuber.\r\nIn beiden Patientengruppen zeigen sich die komorbiden Storungen Alexithymie und\r\nStress.\r\nBei den neurologischen Patienten deutet die Alexithymie moglicherweise auf einen\r\ngrundlegenden Mangel an emotionaler Kompetenz hin, eine wichtige Vorraussetzung\r\nfur die eigene Krankheitsbewaltigung. Die chronischen Stressbelastungen scheinen\r\nweniger direkt durch die neurologische Erkrankung bedingt, sondern vielmehr durch\r\nden - hilflosen - Umgang mit der Symptomatik und der neuen Lebenssituation.\r\nErlernen von Bewaltigungsstrategien, insbesondere mit dem Ziel eines adaquaten\r\nKrankheitsumgangs, konnte somit nicht nur einen bestimmenden Faktor fur die\r\nAbnahme der Alexithymie darstellen, sondern auch fur die Depressivitat und die\r\nStressbelastung.\r\nFur das stationare Behandlungskonzept scheint die Therapie der komorbiden\r\nStorungen sowie die Krankheitsbewaltigung eine zentrale Rolle in der Behandlung von neurologischen Patienten zu spielen. Ob jedoch eine Verbesserung der\r\nkomorbiden Storungen langfristig einen Einfluss auf den Verlauf der neurologischen\r\nSymptomatik hat, mussten Untersuchungen innerhalb eines langeren Zeitraumes\r\nklaren. Fur eine Veranderung der neurologischen Symptomatik ist der von uns\r\nbeobachtete Zeitraum moglicherweise zu kurz gewesen.\r\nDie Ergebnisse unserer Studie erlauben die Diskussion, dass die Angst der\r\nAngstpatienten Ausdruck einer zugrunde liegenden Depression und moglicherweise\r\nauch Ausdruck einer bestehenden Alexithymie und chronischen Stressbelastung sein\r\nkonnte. Der Gesamteindruck von Angstpatienten wird unserer Beobachtung nach\r\nhauptsachlich durch die Angstsymptomatik bestimmt. Den vorhandenen komorbiden\r\nStorungen und deren notwendige Behandlung wurde damit eine zu geringe\r\nBedeutung beigemessen werden. Die Folge ware eine Persistenz der komorbiden\r\nStorungen als Ausdruck weiterhin bestehender struktureller und Verhaltensdefizite.\r\nDies konnte jedoch den Boden fur eine wiederkehrende Angstsymptomatik bilden\r\nund somit die vielfach beobachtete Chronizitat von Angststorungen erklaren. Weitere\r\nUntersuchungen uber einen langeren Beobachtungszeitraum sind zur Klarung dieser\r\nFrage notig.\r\nBeide komorbiden Storungen, Alexithymie und chronische Stressbelastung haben\r\nsich im Verlauf jedoch nicht als eindeutige Moderatorvariablen identifizieren lassen.\r\nDie von uns vermuteten Einflusse geben Anlass zu weiteren Untersuchungen.\r\nUnsere Ergebnisse zeigen in beiden Gruppen einen unterschiedlichen Ruckgang der\r\nDepressivitat, gleichzeitig mit einer unterschiedlichen Besserung der\r\nGrunderkrankung bei gleicher Einschatzung des Entlassungszustandes. Die Wahl der\r\nDepressivitat als Indikatorvariable fur den Besserungsverlauf lasst sich vor diesem\r\nHintergrund kritisch diskutieren, ebenso die Frage nach einer Definition des\r\nBesserungsverlaufes.\r\nZusammenfassend zeigen die Ergebnisse unserer Studie, dass sich der\r\nstorungsspezifische Besserungsverlauf von Angst- und neurologischen Erkrankungen\r\nzwar unterscheidet; die Unterschiede aber genau entgegen der Hypothese ausgefallen\r\nsind.",

Method: Eighty-five women, aged 18–65 years, were treated and monitored over the course of 4 years. Results: Vaginismus affects a woman’s life on many levels, bringing with it physical pain, emotional anguish, and the sense of failure and inadequacy. Sexual dysfunctions are an inevitable outcome, as are penetration difficulties apparent in undergoing a pelvic examination, inserting a tampon, and having intercourse. Vaginismus affects female adolescents and women indiscriminately, across cultural, religious, and professional barriers. Vaginismus may manifest itself as mild, with some anxiety, or as severe, with devastating panic attacks. The etiology is complex and varied and requires clinical proficiency to achieve a resolution. Successful intervention must be rendered through the body and the mind to ensure a complete resolution. Conclusion: A team approach to etiology and management is required to fully address the components of the condition and to bring about a cure.",

The symptoms included depressive state, delusion, confusion, psychomotor excitement and delirium, all of which disappeared in about two months. At first, we regarded all the symptoms as alcoholic hallucinosis, by a clinical standpoint, in spite of no auditory hallucination in this case. However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors. One of the possibilities is that delusion might have been induced by aripiprazole. There still may be some other unknown influential factors on withdrawal, which are indicated by previous papers.",

In der psychiatrischen Epidemiologie hingegen existieren nur ganz wenige longitudinale Studien. In diesem Artikel werden einige Ergebnisse einer solchen, der «Zürich Studie», zu Zwangsstörungen zusammengefasst. Es fand sich eine hohe Prävalenz von Zwangsstörungen entsprechend DSM-5-Kriterien, der Verlauf war häufig chronisch, aber langfristig war die Remissionsrate mit fast 60% höher als bisher angenommen. In Bezug auf die Komorbidität fanden sich generell hohe Raten an komorbiden Störungen und ein besonders enger Zusammenhang mit der sozialen Phobie.",

      "title": "The promise of social recovery therapy in non‐affective psychoses",
      "abstract": "Non-affective psychoses (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders) are the health conditions of working age adults most frequently associated with poor social outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that less than 50% of people with these conditions achieve social recovery, less than 15% achieve sustained recovery in both symptomatic and social domains, and only 10-20% of people return to competitive employment, despite the majority reporting that they wish to work1. Social recovery therapy (SRT) is a psychosocial treatment to promote social recovery in people with non-affective psychosis who are socially withdrawn, have complex and comorbid problems, and are unresponsive to existing interventions. It is based on a model in which social disability evolves as a result of lifestyle patterns of low activity, adopted to achieve behavioral avoidance, and maintained by lack of hope, agency and motivation. Social disability in psychosis typically occurs in the context of persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by depression, anxiety and other psychopathological manifestations. Alongside such issues are complex social circumstances and systemic issues, including problematic family dynamics, victimization, social threat and social deprivation. In the face of such problems, individuals adopt lifestyle patterns of extreme social withdrawal, leaving work or education and losing contact with social networks. SRT is described in a manual2 and delivered individually across 9 months. Sessions take place in participants' homes and community locations. Interim telephone and email contact usually occurs. SRT delivery is structured in three stages. Stage 1 includes assessment and development of a shared social recovery formulation. Stage 2 involves identifying and working towards medium- to long-term goals guided by a systemic formulation of barriers to recovery, with a focus on promoting a sense of agency, hope and motivation, and encouraging activity while managing psychotic symptoms. Stage 3 involves the active promotion of structured activity linked to meaningful goals, while still managing symptoms. The focus of the intervention is on the individual's personal values and goals, identifying problems and barriers to these, then promoting hope for meaningful behavioral change and activity toward these goals. There is a strong emphasis on the use of behavioral strategies (including behavioral experiments, graded exposure and behavioral activation) to overcome avoidance and promote meaningful lifestyle change in vivo whilst managing symptoms as necessary to implement a concrete pathway to social recovery. Evidence and experiences from this behavioral work are used to further instill hope and promote positive beliefs about self as the individual works towards achieving meaningful change in his/her life. As SRT aims to engage people with psychosis into structured activity, it often includes supporting them to access employment, education, training, voluntary and/or leisure opportunities. Much of SRT takes place in community settings. It is often useful for the therapist to drive the client to new locations and settings or accompany him/her on public transport. To achieve gains in social recovery against a background of often years of withdrawal and social disadvantage means that therapists have to integrate techniques typically associated with assertive community treatment and supported employment. Working systemically with families and stakeholders surrounding the individual to promote opportunities in the social environment is also important. Behavioral activation and behavioral experiments are conducted in line with the client's identified goals and values and at a pace respecting the nature of the difficulties faced. The therapist works alongside the client to aid motivation and engagement in identified activities that can be incorporated into daily life, and work out collaborative strategies to manage ongoing symptoms in vivo. To date, we have conducted two assessor-blind randomized controlled trials of SRT in people with psychosis with severe social disability. In the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial3, 77 participants with affective or non-affective psychosis presenting social withdrawal were randomized to receive either SRT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. TAU consisted of case management from a secondary mental health care team. In the non-affective psychosis group, SRT showed a significant and clinically beneficial effect on the primary outcome of weekly hours in structured activity, as well as on positive and negative symptoms. There was also an effect of SRT on hopelessness and positive beliefs about self, with improvements on these variables being a mediator of the change in structured activity. The intervention was also cost-effective4. SUPEREDEN35 was a larger (N=154) phase 2 trial aimed to enhance social recovery in patients who had not responded to early intervention service (EIS) treatment, by combining standard EIS provision with SRT. The primary analysis indicated that the SRT plus EIS was associated with an average increase in structured activity over 8 hours per week greater than EIS alone (95% CI: 2.5-13.6; p=0.005). The size of the effect represents an amount of activity equivalent to a full working day. There is evidence from both the above trials that the gain from SRT may be maintained 6 months beyond active treatment. In a further separate longer-term follow-up study on the ISREP group6, none of the 24 cases in the TAU group had engaged in paid employment in the year following the end of the intervention period, compared with 5 out of 20 (25%) cases in the SRT+TAU group. SRT offers most promise in promoting social recovery in complex cases of non-affective psychoses in which there is little evidence of response to other interventions. Although the results from the two available randomized controlled trials are positive, further large scale pragmatic studies are needed, possibly being expanded to more chronic cases. There may also be promise in combining SRT approaches with other psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive remediation therapy7. We designed SRT so that it can be delivered in task-sharing formats by a less costly and more widely available workforce than that involved in the above trials. We have now developed extensive training materials, including videos as well as adherence and supervision guidance, which we have collated on a website8. Through this and related work, we have found that it is possible to train \"non-expert therapists\" in key elements of the SRT approach, which can then be successfully implemented following the manual. What is needed in the future is to build on the promise of the existing trials of SRT toward further research and implementation involving non-expert therapists and extending into wider populations of people with non-affective psychosis in the community.",

The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is associated with significant impairment in social and occupational functioning. Gender differences in social anxiety disorder are apparent for treatment seeking and symptom clusters, and hormonal influences may affect the natural course of illness. The lifetime prevalence rate is 13.3%, with rates of 15.5% in women and 11.1% in men. Although most studies indicate that more women suffer from social anxiety disorder, it appears that men are more likely to seek treatment. Gender differences in the presentation and management of social anxiety disorder may be influenced by fluctuations in levels of endogenous or exogenous reproductive hormones. Neurotransmitter systems implicated in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders may be affected by both estrogen and progesterone. There are also issues with regard to pregnancy in women who have social anxiety disorder. It is not known if untreated social anxiety disorder represents a significant risk to the fetus. However, social anxiety disorder often is complicated by comorbid depression, panic disorder, or substance abuse, all of which may pose risks to the fetus if left untreated. Treatment strategies for patients with social anxiety disorder should consider gender differences in response to pharmacotherapy, psychiatric comorbidity, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy status, and the specific nature of symptoms in the individual patient.",

The patient has been seizure-free and asymptomatic for more than 5 years after resection. There were no operative complications. The patient’s behavior and neurocognitive performance have improved markedly, and he is now employed and does not require supervision. Also, there has been a pronounced reduction in the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug medication. Partial or localization-related epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder. Approximately 90% of the adult incident cases of epilepsy have recurrent and unprovoked partial seizures. An estimated 20% of patients with epilepsy have an intractable seizure disorder, that is, pharmacoresistant seizures that are physically and socially disabling. Coexisting comorbid conditions associated with an intractable seizure disorder often include cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, psychosocial isolation, and the inability to operate a motor vehicle or to be gainfully employed. Patients with medically refractory seizures may also require a supervised living situation or caregiver. A prognostic indicator for an unfavorable response to antiepileptic drug therapy is the identification of a structural lesion as the cause of the seizure disorder. Potential alternative forms of therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy include the use of newer antiepileptic drug medications, surgical treatment, and vagus nerve stimulation.",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Depressive disorders in children and adolescents are common and often disabling. They can interfere with normal growth and development, academic performance, and interpersonal relationships, and they are a significant risk factor for suicide. These disorders fall on a spectrum that ranges from mild symptoms of depressed mood, which might occur in response to an acute stressor, to pervasive sad or irritable mood accompanied by problems with sleep, appetite, social isolation, and sometimes, suicidal ideas, plans, and intent. Prevalence rates for depression range from 1% to 2% of prepubertal children to 3% to 8% of adolescents. Depression in prepubertal children and bipolar disorder in any age group are equally common in both sexes. However, unipolar depressive disorders in adolescents are more common in girls than in boys (ratio of 3:1), and early onset of puberty in girls increases the risk for depression. (1)Depressed children and adolescents manifest a variety of signs and symptoms. They can be sad, irritable, or angry and may present with school or behavioral problems. They can demonstrate somatic complaints (eg, headache, stomachache, muscle weakness), decreased or increased appetite, fatigue, insomnia, hypersomnia, or disturbed sleep-wake cycles. Some children and adolescents develop psychotic features consistent with their mood symptoms, such as paranoid delusions or auditory hallucinations with self-deprecatory content. Some develop self-injurious behaviors or suicidal ideation, plan, and intent. Anxiety symptoms may be present and may predate the development of depressive symptoms. Behavioral problems ranging from oppositional defiance to frank conduct disorder may occur in conjunction with an underlying mood disorder.Depressive disorders vary in degree of severity as well as in intensity and duration of symptoms. Adjustment disorders accompanied by depressed mood can be acute but severe; major depression (with or without psychotic features) can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders are specific and detailed and can be found in the latest American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Potential risk factors for depression are many, ranging from genetic loading to tumultuous life events. However, it is the interaction between biologic vulnerability and environmental stress that takes center stage. Environmental risk factors include abuse or neglect; parental substance abuse; marital problems; low socioeconomic status and education level; loss of parent, sibling, or close friend; and stress related to adolescent developmental or issues of sexuality (eg, homosexuality). Genetic risk factors seem to play a greater role in adolescent depression than in prepubertal depression, with the most potent risk factor being parental depression. The depressed parent contributes both genetic vulnerability and emotional unavailability that can contribute to family dissension and instability. Newer research suggests that the combination of adverse life events and the presence of the shorter allelic form of the serotonin transporter gene results in early-onset depression. (2)Functional neuroimaging studies in children and adolescents reflect many of the same findings seen in similar studies of adults. The details of such adult studies are beyond the scope of this review, but most have found smaller prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in depressed individuals. Less work has been done in this area with children and adolescents because of the higher risks associated with radiation exposure. Early, preliminary studies suggest that such structural differences may be transmitted genetically and serve as a marker of inherited risk for depression. (3)The nature of the relationship between neuroendocrine changes and depressive disorders in children and adolescents is not well understood. Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, as detected by the dexamethasone suppression test, may reflect a similar risk for depressive disorders in children and adolescents as for adults. Studies of growth hormone secretion theorize that a blunted response to growth hormone may represent vulnerability for early-onset depression in children and adolescents. Similarly, response patterns of depressed children and nondepressed children who have family histories of affective illness may be associated with an increased risk of depression as well as aggressive and suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. (4)Other risk factors for depressive disorders include certain types of medications (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, isotretinoin, antiviral agents) and any chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis, juvenile diabetes, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell anemia, organ transplantation, and cancer.Diagnosing depressive disorders in children and adolescents can be difficult because the presentation can vary widely, depending on developmental stage. Furthermore, almost all children experience some sadness at times of stress, and normal adolescence can be a time of intense moodiness, impulsivity, and erratic behavior. Nevertheless, the risk for continued morbidity and impairment of social function makes differentiation of children who demonstrate symptoms consistent with significant depression from those who are transiently upset in response to stressful circumstances very important. Such assessment can be difficult because few reliable tests support the differentiation. The clinical history and mental status examination are most important. Such evaluations can be time-consuming and challenging because children and adolescents may not volunteer information about their mood, feelings, and circumstances unless they are asked specific, detailed questions. Furthermore, even if asked, they may not be able to recognize or describe changes in mood.Pediatricians who evaluate children and adolescents must determine the presence or absence of symptoms of a depressive disorder; the child's current level of functioning relative to his or her baseline; and the potential for self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt. The evaluation involves obtaining a history from the child as well as from the parent or guardian and other caregivers such as teachers, counselors, or coaches. The family's cultural background can contribute to the child's presentation and must be taken into account.The child may report disturbances in mood, sleep, or appetite or note suicidal thoughts or wishes but may be less likely to comment on changes in peer relationships or school performance. Information about interpersonal interactions should be obtained from collateral sources. Any child affected with a disturbance of mood that is persistent and pervasive and interferes with day-to-day functioning should be assessed for depression. Although some fear that asking children and adolescents questions about their level of psychosocial functioning, their mood, or their risk for self-injury can predispose them to mood disorders or to destructive action, all available evidence suggests the opposite. (5)Assessment of depressive disorders in children must be viewed through the developmental lens. What may be an acute stressor for an elementary school student may have less affective resonance for a middle or high school student and vice versa. A high school freshman will not expect to make the varsity basketball team, whereas a fifth grader might be devastated if relegated to a \"B\" team after tryouts. A chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis may be less difficult for an 8-year-old third grader who still can play video games and go out for recess than for a high school student who cannot keep up with the rapid pace of school, sports, and parties, who feels ostracized and isolated, and who understands the concept of terminal illness. The importance of such stressors can be missed if the clinician does not recognize the potential power of a seemingly minor loss or defeat in the life of a child.Supplementation of the clinical history with self-report questionnaires can be enormously helpful, particularly in the primary care setting. Examples of such instruments include the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), (6) which assesses the severity of depression in prepubertal school-age children, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), (7) Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2), (8) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) (9) for older adolescents. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC) Toolkit also has child and parent report measures and scoring instructions on their web site (http://www.thereachinstitute.org/files/documents/GLAD-PCToolkit.pdf). This user-friendly online resource also includes management flowcharts, scales, and educational materials in English and Spanish, as well as tracking forms and information on billing.Comorbid disorders in depressed children and adolescents include anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, and conduct disorder. Some disorders, such as ADHD, may be transmitted genetically in families; others likely have a bidirectional causality with, for example, substance abuse (alcohol, recreational drugs, tobacco) as both a potential cause and effect of depression.Management of child and adolescent depressive disorders in primary care settings is challenging because of time constraints, the paucity of formal clinical guidelines, and lack of access to mental health professionals. Nevertheless, given the morbidity and potential mortality associated with depression in children and adolescents, pediatricians have a responsibility to learn to identify children at risk and ensure appropriate evaluation either by themselves or with consultation or referral.For children and adolescents who have mild depressive symptoms, supportive counseling, problem-solving discussions, and education of family members may suffice. However, for more severe symptoms, other interventions may be necessary. Approaches for treatment of moderate and severe depression include the prescribing of medication, either alone or with other interpersonal therapies. Three types of treatments are validated empirically: 1) psychopharmacologic intervention, specifically selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), either alone or in combination with psychotherapy; 2) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and 3) interpersonal therapy (IPT).Antidepressant medications, specifically the SSRIs, have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression in adults, children, and adolescents. Currently, fluoxetine is the only antidepressant approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of children and adolescents, although research studies have demonstrated efficacy of other drugs such as citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline. The 2006 FDA meta-analysis of children and adolescents taking SSRIs for the treatment of depression found an increased risk of suicidality in those patients treated with drugs versus those given placebo. Subsequent meta-analysis, using additional studies not included in the FDA report, revealed that those who benefited from SSRI treatment outnumbered those who became suicidal during SSRI treatment by a ratio of 14:1. Some suggest that the temporal relationship between the decrease in prescribing practices after implementation of the FDA black box warning and the recent increase in adolescent suicide attempts provides evidence that SSRI treatment of depression can be lifesaving. (10)Because the most evidence for efficacy and safety exists for fluoxetine, many suggest that it should be the first choice for medication management of depressive symptoms. The success of treatment can be reassessed after a 6- to 8-week trial, unless adverse effects or a worsening clinical picture dictate earlier intervention. Common adverse effects from fluoxetine include nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbance with vivid dreams, and agitation. Dosage can start as low as 2.5 mg/day for prepubertal children and 10 mg/day for older adolescents, with increases based on clinical response at 2-week intervals according to the pharmacokinetic profile of the medication. Most patients respond to fluoxetine at doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day.For vulnerable patients, any antidepressant can precipitate agitation and secondary mania and, therefore, should be used with caution. The FDA suggests careful monitoring of medication response, with weekly face-to-face meetings between caregiver and patient or patient's family for the first month, although no evidence supports such management, and it is likely that weekly consultation by phone could be sufficient. The interval between visits can be lengthened to biweekly for the next 4 weeks and subsequently reduced further, based on the clinical situation. Consideration of a trial of other antidepressants in children and adolescents, either SSRIs or other classes, should prompt consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist prior to initiation. Studies regarding clinical efficacy and response of childhood depression to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine have been inconclusive.Most unipolar, untreated depressive disorders in children and adolescents last between 3 and 12 months. The risk of recurrence ranges from 34% to 50% within the first year after discontinuation of treatment; 50% to 75% of affected children have a relapse within 8 years following the initial episode. (11) Comorbid disorders such as anxiety or substance abuse, presence of suicidal ideation, recurrent episodes of parental depression, and family chaos predispose to a longer duration of active symptoms.Depression in children and adolescents should be conceptualized as a chronic illness. Clinicians should treat the acute episode until the patient's symptoms are in remission. Additional treatment should focus on prevention. In general, if the symptoms have not improved or remitted after a 6- to 8-week trial on medication or if the patient has developed intolerable adverse effects, the clinician should change medication. If the response to treatment has been partial, the clinician might consider increasing the dose of the current medication, adding another agent, or suggesting other types of therapy. Of note, treatment failure in adolescents might be due to noncompliance rather than refractory symptoms. If the patient's depression has gone into remission, therapy to prevent recurrence should continue for another 6 to 9 months. More than 90% of children and adolescent outpatients who have depressive disorder recover within 1 to 2 years. Because no data are available on the long-term effects of medication on children or adolescents, it is difficult to justify indefinite continuation of treatment. However, given the risks for recurrence and relapse, it is prudent to monitor children and adolescents closely, even after treatment.CBT is the best studied nonpharmacologic intervention for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The theoretical underpinning of this therapy postulates that depressed children and adolescents have distortions in their thought processes that cause them to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects of any given situation. Stressful events serve to accentuate the negative ideation and precipitate depressive episodes, which then may cause counterproductive or maladaptive behaviors. A common therapeutic format includes: psychoeducation; behavioral modification involving active scheduling of enjoyable activities; cognitive restructuring to reframe distortions and allow for new, more rational thoughts; and learning self-relaxation techniques. Most studies of CBT have suggested that it is an extremely effective intervention for depressive disorders in children and adolescents.The Treatment for Adolescent Depression Study (TADS), published in 2004, evaluated fluoxetine, CBT, and the combination of the two in terms of relative efficacy in the treatment of adolescent depression versus placebo. (12) In this well-powered study, fluoxetine and CBT together and fluoxetine alone were superior to CBT alone and to placebo. CBT alone failed to demonstrate the same efficacy found in earlier studies, perhaps because the patients in TADS were extremely ill and presented with more comorbid conditions. It also is possible that the CBT treatment package used in TADS employed too many different techniques to allow any one technique enough time to succeed.IPT centers on the problems in the patient's interpersonal interactions, seeking to change conflicted, hostile relationships into supportive, meaningful, and satisfying ones. The focus of the therapy usually is on development of social skills and investigation of the effect of shifting roles within family or peer groups, including adjustment to such events as parental divorce or remarriage. In IPT, the patient looks at his or her place within a larger social context. In contrast, CBT focuses on the patient's internal thought processes and how they influence perspective and behavioral patterns.Any one of the three previously noted approaches is a reasonable first choice in the treatment of children and adolescents whose symptoms are moderate. Medication likely is the best choice for those who have more severe symptoms, coupled with CBT or supportive counseling, depending on available resources. Evidence suggests that the relationship and degree of trust between child and therapist is a good predictor of the efficacy of therapy. Children and adolescents who fail to respond to initial interventions within 6 to 8 weeks and those who have very severe mood disorders and accompanying significant impairment in psychosocial functioning or suicidal ideation, plan, or intent should be referred to a child psychiatrist or mental health specialist, if possible (Table 1). Most children and adolescents who have depressive disorders can be managed as outpatients. However, those who are actively suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic should be hospitalized.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (13) suicide is the third leading cause of death in the United States among adolescents and young adults ages 10 to 24 years. From 1990 to 2003, suicide rates in that age group declined from 9.48 to 6.78 per 100,000. However, from 2003 to 2004 (the most recent year for which data are available), the rate increased to 7.32 per 100,000. This increase reflects upward trends in three groups: females ages 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years and males ages 15 to 19 years. Hanging/suffocation was the most common cause of death in females in all age groups and firearms the most common method used by males. There are ethnic disparities within these age groups: Native American/Alaskan Native youth and Hispanic females have a higher percentage of suicide attempts than their peers. Few prepubertal children successfully commit suicide (suicide rate 0.6 per 100,000 for ages 5 to 14 years), but these children are at high risk for suicide attempts in their adolescence and young adulthood.Suicidal ideation and gestures also are increasing in frequency. Although there is no national registry for such behaviors, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, 2005, a survey of high school students across the United States, reveal that 16.9% considered suicide and 8.4% had attempted suicide within the past year. Both mood and anxiety disorders increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation. In prepubertal children, suicidal ideation can be associated with disruptive disorders. In adolescents, substance abuse and separation anxiety may predispose to such ideation.These statistics are sobering and argue for vigorous efforts at early identification of children and adolescents at risk as well as aggressive prevention and intervention. One instrument used to screen adolescents for psychiatric illness is the Teen-Screen, a school-based program that screened 55,000 students in 2005. The screening has two parts: a self-report questionnaire and an open-ended interview by a skilled mental health professional. The combination of the questionnaire and interview ensures that a positive result on the self-report also is reflected in the clinical history. The program is voluntary but requires consent of the student's parent or guardian. If the student's questionnaire and interview suggest the presence of psychiatric illness, he or she is referred for additional psychiatric evaluation. The Teen-Screen is controversial because many feel that it violates parental rights and that the high false-positive rate invalidates the testing. Although the \"screen\" has a high sensitivity but low specificity, the risk of overlooking a truly suicidal adolescent seems greater than the risk of misdiagnosing (and potentially stigmatizing) a normal teenager.About 70% of adolescents are seen by their primary care physicians at least once a year. The same percentage reports a willingness to talk with their primary care physicians about their mental health. Pediatricians must be trained to detect psychiatric illness that may predispose their patients to self-injurious behaviors. They also must be alert to the risk factors for suicide in children and adolescents: mood disorder, substance abuse, loss of a loved one, family discord, social isolation, family history of suicidal behavior, previous suicide attempt, and availability of firearms.Any child experiencing a mood disorder or substance abuse should be considered at risk for suicide and evaluated thoroughly. Questions to ask might include those listed in Table 2. If a child or adolescent is actively suicidal, with plan or intent or both, the clinician should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of the child.Suicidal \"gestures,\" such as superficial cutting or ingestion of a few extra pills, must be taken seriously. Any episode of self-inflicted harm may be a sign of attempted suicide. A child or adolescent might believe that the \"gesture\" could have caused death or he or she might believe that an overdose of, for example, acetaminophen is safe because it is a drug that can be bought easily at the drugstore. It also is important to review with the child or adolescent what \"death\" or \"killing oneself\" means. A child younger than 6 years of age might be unable to appreciate the finality of death.No evidence suggests that \"no suicide contracts\" (in which the patient agrees not to harm him- or herself and lists ways to help him- or herself should suicidal feelings arise) are preventive. If the child or adolescent is actively suicidal, it is unlikely that he or she is in any position to understand the contract or to agree to it. Furthermore, once such a contract is signed, parents or guardians charged with helping the child to stay safe might become less vigilant.For a child or adolescent who has attempted suicide, it is helpful to assess the risk/rescue ratio. This practice assesses the risk of the action in relation to the likelihood of rescue. The child who overdoses on a medication late at night, tells no one, and goes to sleep hoping never to wake up is different from the child who takes a handful of pills while standing in the kitchen arguing with a parent.In most cases, the legal guardians (parents or other caregivers) must be informed of the results of the assessment; issues of confidentiality become moot in the setting of active suicidal (or homicidal) ideation with intent and plan. Questions regarding availability of and access to firearms and other vectors of harm (including knives, drugs, and poisons) must be discussed, with the goal of removing access to these items in the home or any place where the child or adolescent might go. Usually, it is necessary to hospitalize actively suicidal children and adolescents on psychiatric inpatient units for their immediate safety as well as for containment, stabilization, psychopharmacologic evaluation, and ultimate referral to an outpatient network of care.One of the most frightening aspects of adolescent suicides is the potential for contagion and cluster formation. Perspectives differ on what constitutes a \"cluster,\" but for the purposes of this article, it is defined as three or more suicides occurring within the same community that bear a temporal relationship to one another. The etiology of cluster formation is controversial. One theory looks at suicide as an infectious disease, as if the impetus to kill oneself is contagious. Another suggests that vulnerable adolescents, particularly those who are depressed, become suicidal in the face of intense loss. Cluster formation can pose a true public health dilemma because too much media coverage (television, Internet) can contribute to the contagious or imitative risk. However, that risk must be balanced with the need for information to be distributed throughout the community as an aid in the process of recovery and healing.",

Warning signsWhen symptoms are present for more than a month, cause diffi culties in functioning normally at a social, professional or other important level, or cause signifi cant suffering, it may be a PTSD.However, traumatic events do not cause PTSD in everyone who experiences them.Certain factors could lead to vulnerability to developing the disorder: having a biological fragility, having been the victim of physical or sexual abuse in the past, suffering from other mental health disorders [3], having had behavioral problems during childhood or adolescence or being subjected to chronic stressors.",

      "title": "Acidente vascular encefálico culminando em depressão maior: uma revisão / Stroke culminating in major depression: a review",
      "abstract": "Objetivo: A depressão pode ser uma complicação psiquiátrica do acidente vascular encefálico (AVE), contudo tal relação precisa ser mais bem elucidada. Assim, objetivou-se revisar a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão maior. Metodologia: Foram utilizadas as bases de dados PubMed, Cochrane e EMBASE, com os descritores “depression” ou “mood” e “stroke” ou “cerebrovascular”, sendo selecionados 37 artigos. Foram excluídas publicações anteriores ao ano de 2000. Resultados e Discussão: A depressão é a alteração psiquiátrica mais associada ao AVE, sendo mais incidente de 3-6 meses pós-AVE: a cada 3 pacientes que sofrem AVE, 1 desenvolve depressão. O quadro está relacionado a características sociais e clínicas individuais (sexo, apoio familiar recebido, déficit de função e grau de dependência, extensão e localização do dano e presença de outras alterações vasculares), sendo a incapacidade física desencadeada pelo evento agudo o fator de risco mais relevante para o desenvolvimento do quadro. Mesmo diante disso, os resultados dos estudos sobre a depressão pós-AVE são discordantes, posto que existe a dificuldade em estabelecer e padronizar diagnóstico. Ainda que exista essa barreira, estudos sugerem que o desenvolvimento de depressão está relacionado à área específica do cérebro acometida no AVE. A associação mais evidente está relacionada aos eventos que atingem o circuito pré-frontosubcortical, sobretudo do hemisfério esquerdo. Em contrapartida, outros estudos afirmam que o desenvolvimento de depressão pós-AVE se relaciona com a extensão do dano e não com a área neuronal acometida. Conclusão: Embora a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão precise ser elucidada é inegável que existe uma relação entre ambas. É necessário mais conhecimento para firmar os fatores de risco e os desfechos associados e, por conseguinte, entender a etiologia e as implicações desta condição na recuperação neurológica dos pacientes.",

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

A very wide range of non-motor symptoms can appear in Parkinson's disease. Impairment of the urinary function and the sexual function (understood as the capacity to carry out sexual activity) can be seen as belonging to the dysautonomic disorders. Hypersexuality would be included within the group of impulse control disorders.This study reviews the epidemiology, phenomenology and treatment of urinary disorders, sexual dysfunction and hypersexuality as non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.Urinary disorders are the most frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease. They usually present as nocturia, urgency and increased mictional frequency (pollakiuria). Preferred treatment is with anticholinergic agents. Sexual dysfunction is a frequent complaint in patients with Parkinson. It has a multifactorial aetiology and is more frequent in males than in females. In males it manifests mainly as incapacity to achieve an erection, premature ejaculation or loss of the capacity to ejaculate, whereas in females the predominant signs are decreased libido, lowered arousal and difficulty in reaching an orgasm. Hypersexuality affects young males above all and has been related to the use of dopamine agonists.",

      "title": "Management of Recurrent Depression in Primary Care",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a major depressive episode of recent onset. She had 2 previous episodes 1 and 3 years earlier, which had been treated by her primary care physician with fluoxetine for 6 months each time. There is no evidence of bipolar illness. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent condition in the general population. Its chronic and recurrent nature is getting increasing attention [1]. Approximately 8 of 10 people experiencing a major depressive disorder will have 1 or more episodes during their lifetime, i.e., a recurrent major depressive disorder [2]. In some patients, the episodes are separated by many symptom-free years of normal functioning. For others, the episodes become increasingly frequent [3]. This latter course appears to be the more prevalent, both in psychiatric and primary care settings [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].Partial remission between episodes, not full recovery, appears to be the rule and is associated with residual disability [7]. At least 1 patient out of 3 is likely to relapse within a year [4, 5, 6]. Two major risk factors associated with relapse appear to be persistence of subthreshold or subclinical symptoms and number of episodes of major depression [4, 5, 6, 7]. As a result, for most people, depression is a life-long episodic disorder with multiple recurrences (averaging 1 episode in every 5-year period) [8].The adverse economic, interpersonal and medical consequences (e.g. work impairment, and family dysfunction) of the course of unipolar depression are considerable [1]. The case vignette thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or specialty settings. As our patient meets the criteria for recurrent depression developed by Frank et al. [10](≥3 episodes of unipolar depression, with the immediately preceding episode being no more than 2.5 years before the onset of the present episode), there is an 80–90% chance of relapse within 2 years from remission of depression and discontinuation of antidepressant treatment [10, 11].Since the chances of relapse are so high, the primary care physician would think of referral to a psychiatric specialist as the next logical step, relying on his/her clinical judgment for further therapeutic strategies. There is very little empirical support, however, that this choice, per se, entails substantial benefits for the patient. An impressive series of studies point to this conclusion.Simon et al. [12]compared the 6-month outcome in depressed patients receiving antidepressant prescriptions either from psychiatrists or primary care physicians. The proportion receiving antidepressant medication at an adequate dose for 90 days or more was similar in both cases (about 50%). The two groups showed similar rates of improvement in all measures of symptom severity and functioning [12]. Even collaboration between primary care physicians and mental health consultants [13]or implementation of clinical-practice guidelines and practice-based education [14]did not yield any significant advantage over usual care in long-term outcome.Three hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia who had recovered after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment by their primary care physicians were randomized to a relapse prevention program (involving a depression specialist) or usual primary care [15]. There were no significant differences in the relapse rate over a 12-month follow-up period.What emerges from these studies is the failure of the mental health specialist to improve the outcome of major depression in the primary care setting [16]. The introduction of more tolerable and easy-to-use antidepressant drugs, compared with the traditional tricyclics (which required dosages that nonpsychiatric physicians were reluctant to use), has blurred the difference among physicians in prescribing antidepressant drugs. At the same time, an impressive amount of pharmaceutical propaganda has clouded the evidence which underlies clinical decisions [17]. The main therapeutic strategies are now described, taking into consideration the most reliable findings available.Maintenance pharmacotherapy has been advocated as an effective tool for reducing relapses and recurrences in major depression [18, 19, 20]. A number of studies have demonstrated the superiority of antidepressant drugs (mostly tricyclics) against placebo in protecting the patient from relapsing [18, 19, 20]. Their average duration was 17 months [21]and only one small trial of imipramine reached 5 years [22]. Viguera et al. [23]analyzed 27 studies with variable length of antidepressant treatment which reported follow-up on drug discontinuation. Duration of drug treatment did not seem to affect long-term prognosis once the drug was discontinued. In clinical terms, this means that it does not matter whether you have treated a depressed patient for 3 months or 3 years, when you stop the drug. Indeed, there was a statistical trend which suggested that the longer the drug treatment, the higher was the likelihood of relapse [23]. An observational study on 236 unipolar patients, who had received antidepressants during recovery and were followed for an affective recurrence for up to 5 years, showed that the rate of recurrence for patients with fewer than 5 previous episodes was not affected by medication after the initial 8 months [24]. While benefits of long-term drug treatment have been clearly shown only in outpatients with major depression, we cannot assume that these can be achieved in the milder, heterogeneous forms of depression in primary care [19, 25].If we then consider the case vignette in light of the evidence we have summarized, we reach the following conclusions. One might judge the time of treatment with an antidepressant used by the primary care physician (6 months) in the previous 2 episodes as being too short and expect a more favorable outcome with a longer course of treatment (1 or 2 years). Certainly, during that time, the patient would be more protected from relapse than being drug free, but this would not affect the outcome after discontinuation of the antidepressant drug [23]. The problem would simply be postponed (table 1). One might expect this strategy to be valuable at a time when the patient is particularly exposed to stressful life circumstances. In a controlled study [26], however, maintenance pharmacotherapy was not found to be protective against life stress.Another option would be lifelong pharmacotherapy with antidepressant drugs. This, however, is not easy to communicate to the patient. Not infrequently, the physician starts with a gradual approach (telling the patient it will be for 1 or 2 years, while meaning indefinitely). Andrews [27]raised the issue of being more honest with people with recurrent depression and the need of long-term pharmacotherapy. However, if 'people have a right to the truth' [27], they are also entitled to the full story [28].Even though lifelong pharmacotherapy is chosen (table 2), there is the common and vexing problem of relapse during pharmacotherapy [29]. The return of depressive symptoms during long-term antidepressant treatment was found to occur in 9–57% of patients in published trials [30]. Possible explanations include pharmacological tolerance, loss of placebo effect, increase in disease severity, change in disease pathogenesis, accumulation of a detrimental metabolite, unrecognized rapid cycling, and prophylactic inefficacy [30]. A number of pharmacological strategies have been suggested in uncontrolled and often small trials for addressing this loss of efficacy (increase or decrease in dose, augmentation, change to a different drug), but specific guidelines do not exist [30]. In the first and only large-scale controlled trial [31], about 1 patient out of 3 relapsed during a 3.5-month maintenance treatment with fluoxetine. Two of the 3 patients relapsing while on fluoxetine responded to a blindly determined double dose of fluoxetine. However, part of these patients (11% of the initial ones) relapsed again while on doubled fluoxetine, despite the relatively short follow-up [31]. The patient should thus be warned that loss of clinical effects during long-term pharmacotherapy does occur, despite adequate compliance. Increasing the dose could be effective (at least temporarily), but depression can also become treatment resistant. Results from one study [32]suggest that full doses are superior to lower doses in the maintenance phase. Lower doses, however, are less likely to produce side effects [32]and more likely to allow a successful response by increasing the dosage when there is a loss of clinical effect [29]. The occurrence of side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunctions [21]may undermine compliance and quality of life.Lithium has been found to reduce relapses in unipolar depression [33]. However, also with lithium, progressive loss of clinical effect has been reported [34, 35]. Certainly reemergence of depressive symptoms in allegedly unipolar depressed patient treated with antidepressants calls for reconsideration of differential diagnosis, with particular reference to milder forms of bipolar disorder [29].Recurrence of depression in the case vignette can also be managed by treatment of the new episode with the same or other antidepressant and discontinuation when remission ensues [36]. The appearance of prodromal symptoms generally precedes the full syndrome by weeks or months [36]. An early intervention upon relapse was found to significantly shorten the length of the depressive episode [37]. As a result, relatively frequent follow-up visits and education of patients and their family members to recognize the patient's characteristic prodromal symptoms (which appear to be similar across episodes of the same patient) may potentially increase the efficacy of this approach [36]. This treatment, which is in line with approaches to recurrent disorders in clinical medicine, requires the establishment of a good patient-doctor relationship and a lower degree of compliance compared with the long-term pharmacotherapy. It should also be observed that a substantial proportion of patients discontinue antidepressant therapy after responding to the initial acute phase of treatment, regardless of the physician's advise [38, 39, 40, 41].Two main disadvantages may, however, be present (table 1). One is given by the phenomenon of resistance [29]: the likelihood that a drug treatment may be associated with a diminished chance of response in those patients who successfully responded to it but discontinued it. This phenomenon was considered to be relatively rare. In a naturalistic 6-year follow-up of depressed patients where the intermittent pharmacotherapy was used and patients were treated with the same antidepressant of the initial episode, it was found to take place only in 4% of instances [42]. However, the first study which assessed the efficacy prospectively of reinitiating exactly the same treatment (fluoxetine) in patients who had a depressive relapse upon drug discontinuation [43], provided a different picture. Thirty-eight percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after reinitiation of fluoxetine. The second disadvantage has to do with discontinuation syndromes which may occur, particularly with SSRI, despite tapering [44, 45].The presence of residual symptoms, despite drug or psychotherapeutic treatment, has been strongly correlated with poor long-term outcome [7]. Further, some residual symptoms of major depression may progress to become prodromal symptoms of relapse [7]. This has led to the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive behavioral therapy in its residual phase [46]. In randomized controlled trials [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50], the various applications of this model have been found to yield a lower relapse rate in recurrent depression. Preliminary studies have suggested its usefulness also in atypical depression [51], bipolar disorder [52], and when loss of clinical effects occurs during long-term antidepressant treatment [53]. Its preventive effects appeared to be related to abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being and coping skills. The practical steps for implementing this approach are described in table 2 and detailed elsewhere [46]. It may include discontinuation of antidepressant drug treatment, as outlined in table 2, or its maintenance. It may offer the advantage of yielding enduring effects while limiting the exposure to and costs of drug therapy. There are two main disadvantages (table 1). One is given by the fact that patients should be motivated to undergo a short-term (10–20 sessions) psychotherapeutic treatment while they are apparently well. The other is the fact that, while the other strategies may be pursued by a nonspecialist physician, implementation of the sequential approach requires referral to a specialized psychotherapist.Information is needed about several clinical issues surrounding recurrent depression.Attention has been called to the arbitrary nature of the distinction between treatment response associated with residual symptomatology and refractory depression [54]. At present, we do not know whether different antidepressant drugs may entail different rates of residual symptoms. What we know is that there may be differential remission rates, as was found to be the case for amitriptyline [55]and venlafaxine [56]. The question would be crucial in view of the role of residual symptoms in recurrent depression [54]. Similarly, we do not know whether combinations of antidepressant drugs, as they are used in treatment resistant depression [57], may yield a more pervasive recovery than a single antidepressant.Whether different antidepressant drugs or different dosages of the same antidepressant drug may engender different rates of loss of clinical effects is another crucial, unanswered clinical question [29]. At present, we have only one, large-scale, controlled study [31]on the effects of increasing the dosage of antidepressants. Other strategies, such as switching to a different type of antidepressant, have not been investigated in controlled studies [30]. We also need to know more about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying tolerance to antidepressant drugs [58].Similarly, we do not know whether lack of response to an antidepressant which is reinstituted after a drug-free period in the same patient and which was found to be effective, may differ among drugs [54]. We also need to compare intermittent and continuation pharmacotherapy in controlled studies.Adding cognitive behavioral psychotherapy to the treatment package of recurrent depression was found to yield long-term benefits in terms of relapse rate [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Both discontinuation and maintenance of pharmacotherapy have been used in the sequential approach, but have not been directly compared in controlled studies. Is there an advantage in keeping drug treatment after psychotherapy?Guidelines for the treatment of depression are available to clinicians. Both those developed by the American Psychiatric Association [59]and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Practice Guidelines [60], while providing evidence-based data on the management of the acute phase of depression, do not provide adequate discussion of the different strategies that recurrent depression entails. Evidence indicates that both antidepressant pharmacotherapy and time-limited depression-targeted psychotherapies are efficacious in primary care settings [59]. The Primary Care Guideline Panel recommended maintenance pharmacotherapy for patients with histories of 3 or more depressive episodes and vulnerability to future recurrences because of associated risk factors [60]. Guidelines for treating depression in primary care were developed also in Australia and New Zealand [61]. They suggested at least 2 years of continuation of pharmacotherapy for repeated episodes or where there were other risk factors for relapse [61].Hollon and Shelton [62]show how treatment guidelines for major depressive disorders understate the case for the empirically supported psychosocial interventions. Another important aspect in the development of guidelines is the issue of conflict of interest of those involved in them [63, 64, 65], which disclosure fails to correct [66].The World Health Organization ranked major depression as the fourth most disabling medical disorder by disability-adjusted life years, a measure of burden [67]. By 2010, World Health Organization projected, major depression will be ranked second unless meaningful improvements occur in prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The case illustrated in the vignette outlines the difficulties that prevention of depressive recurrences entails. On the basis of evidence available, the following approach is outlined.First, the patient should be offered adequate information about the prognosis of her depressive illness. It is unlikely that a new course of treatment with the same or similar antidepressant will favorably affect her condition. Andrews [27]remarks that many doctors are concerned that telling people the true prognosis will cause their depression to worsen. However, this very much depends on the content and modalities of the communication. In our Affective Disorders Program, we share with our patients that depression is likely to recur [28]. In the case vignette, we would tell her that depression is very likely to ensue again once antidepressant drugs are stopped. So, one option would be to continue with an antidepressant drug indefinitely. We would tell her, however, that also this option is not completely risk free, since loss of clinical effect may occur. The other option would be to start working on prevention of the next episode. For doing this, we would need to view depression not as something coming 'out of a clear sky', but as a result of a maladaptive lifestyle. Depressed patients are often unaware of the consequences of long-term minor life stresses, interpersonal friction, prolonged anxiety, excessive work, and inadequate rest [11]. It is ironic that, while psychiatrists tend to view prevention of relapse of depression purely in pharmacological terms, as if it were a disease such as diabetes [27], diabetologists, as other medical specialists, emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological strategies [68]. This second option is more difficult to pursue, but is likely to yield enduring effects. We would also explain to the patient that a longer course of treatment with an antidepressant drug this time would be unlikely to yield a better prognosis once the drug is discontinued [23]. In our clinical experience, patients generally look favorably to pursuing a treatment strategy that may provide long-term effects.If the patient described in the vignette accepted to try to pursue a sequential approach, we would treat her with the same drug that was used in the previous 2 episodes. If resistance occurs, we would switch her to a different type of antidepressant (a drug affecting both serotonin and noradrenaline, such as a tricyclic). After 3 months of treatment, we would reassess the patient carefully (table 2). Is she well or simply better? What is the level of residual symptomatology? Such an assessment may require both structured interviews and self-observation (diary). A helpful example which we make is the following. 'When we first saw you, you were very depressed. Driving the way you did, you went off the road. With antidepressant drugs, we did put you back on the road. Things are much better now. However, if you keep on driving the way you used to, you may end up off the road again, sooner or later' [46]. The example outlines the need for lifestyle modification and introduces a sense of control in the patient as to his or her depressive illness. This psychological preparation paves the way for subsequent psychotherapeutic approaches.The clinician could then refer the patient for a short-term (10–20 sessions) course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. This would be the psychotherapeutic approach of choice, since it has been specifically studied for its preventive effects [46]. We would be inclined to taper antidepressant drugs during the course of psychotherapeutic treatment (table 2). Tapering should be performed at the slowest possible pace, to minimize the risk of antidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes [21, 59]. There are no significant differences in relapse rates off medication between studies involving rapid discontinuation and those in which tapering was more gradual [23]. Slow tapering, however, may allow the detection of emerging symptoms in their prodromal phases, which may become the target of psychotherapeutic strategy [54]. Interventions that bring the person out of a negative functioning are one form of success, but facilitating progression toward psychological well-being is quite another [69]. This is an emerging area for psychotherapeutic research and practice [46, 69]. The advantages of maintaining the patient on antidepressant drugs are not clear, unless one aims to keep pharmacotherapy indefinitely and to use the addition of a psychotherapy only as a boosting strategy.A final aspect of the sequential approach lies in a careful assessment of the patient once both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been terminated. If improvement appears to have occurred, the patient can be seen at regular follow-up visits, geared not only to verify the presence of depressive relapses, but also to assess the subclinical symptomatology [7]. If substantial residual symptomatology persists despite clinical response or minimal or no benefits have been achieved by psychotherapeutic approach, then indefinite drug treatment can be discussed with the patient. In our clinical experience, however, the patient has gained a better psychological acceptance of a pharmacological approach. Whether this should be indefinite or intermittent (table 1), very much depends on the patient's preferences and the patient-doctor relationship (with ensuing opportunities for monitoring the patient). Clinical indicators for indefinite, instead of intermittent, drug therapy could be rapid onset of depression with suicidal ideations and the likelihood of severe discontinuation syndromes in a specific patient.Prevention of recurrence in major depression cannot simply be based on prolongation of ongoing pharmacological treatment. The evidence available suggests that the active collaboration of the patient (in choosing a treatment option, in lifestyle modification, in seeking treatment again when needed) is a crucial, and yet neglected variable. This can lead to a more rational use of antidepressant drugs and to therapeutic efforts of more enduring quality than those prevailing today [70].This paper was supported in part by grants from the Ministero dell' Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (MURST, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F. and N.S. and by a grant from the 'Mental Health Evaluation Project' (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F.

      "abstract": "Abstract Ejaculatory dysfunction is a common complaint and is often associated with a reduced quality of life for sufferer and partner. The spectrum of ejaculatory dysfunction extends from premature ejaculation ( PE ) to delayed ejaculation ( DE ) and anejaculation. Over the past 20–30 years, the PE treatment paradigm, previously limited to behavioural psychotherapy, has expanded to include drug treatment. Multiple well‐controlled, evidence‐based studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors in delaying ejaculation, confirming their role as first‐line agents for the treatment of lifelong and acquired PE . More recently, there has been increased attention to the psychosocial consequences of PE , its epidemiology, its aetiology and its pathophysiology by both clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry. DE and anejaculation are probably the least common, least studied and least understood of the male sexual dysfunctions. However, their impact is significant as they may result in a lack of sexual fulfilment for both the man and his partner, an effect further compounded when procreation is among the couple's goals of sexual intercourse. The causes of DE , anejaculation and anorgasmia are manifold. Numerous psychotherapeutic treatments are described for the management of delayed or anejaculation. Although some appear to be effective, none has been properly evaluated in large‐scale samples. Treatment of DE or anejaculation with pharmacotherapy has met with limited success. No drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs that have been identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side‐effects or are yet considered experimental in nature.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "abstract": "Perinatal mental illness influences obstetric outcomes, mother-baby interactions and longer term emotional and cognitive development of the child. Psychiatric disorders have consistently been found to be one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, often through suicide. Postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis are two disorders most commonly associated with the perinatal period. The most efficient strategy to identify patients at risk relies on focussing on clinically vulnerable subgroups: enquiries about depressive symptoms should be made at the usual screening visits. Attention should be paid to any sign of poor self-care, avoidance of eye contact, overactivity or underactivity, or abnormalities in the rate of speech. Particular care should be taken to ask about suicidal ideation and thoughts of harming others, including the baby. One of the most important risk factors is a previous history of depression. The degree of risk is directly correlated with severity of past episodes. Both antenatal and postnatal depression are being increasingly recognised in men. Puerperal psychosis is rare (1 to 2 per 1,000). Sixty per cent of women with puerperal psychosis already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Women with a personal history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar affective disorder should be considered as high risk for postpartum psychosis. All pregnant women who are identified as being at high risk should have a shared care plan for their late pregnancy and early postnatal psychiatric management. Women with current mood disorder of mild or moderate severity who have a first-degree relative with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis should be referred for psychiatric assessment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) represents a significant, dose-dependent risk factor for the development of numerous psychiatric and physical disorders (including diabetes, myocardial infarction, obesity, alcoholism, drug addiction, etc.), as well as for poorer social outcomes (dropping out of school, unemployment, economic decline, unwanted pregnancies) and violent behaviour. A history of maltreatment is found in 80–90% of young offenders, and about one quarter of individuals with a history of severe maltreatment receive criminal convictions. Among the forensic psychiatric patients admitted to the REMS (Residential Facilities for the Enforcement of Security Measures), we have likewise observed a high prevalence of maltreatment, abuse, neglect, and other traumatic events, including those related to war and migratory pathways. We have treated some patients showing psychotic-spectrum symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) that did not respond to pharmacological treatment (including clozapine and clozapine–first-generation antipsychotic combinations). Their condition improved only when trauma-oriented psychotherapy, such as EMDR or Narrative Exposure Therapy for Forensic Offender Rehabilitation (FORNET), was added to antipsychotic treatment. This observation raises critical questions about the overlap between psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms in offending patients with severe early victimization histories, and hence about the link between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. In light of ongoing conflicts, rising geopolitical tensions, and their impact on migration, the early diagnosis and effective treatment of these conditions are of paramount importance from both a public health perspective and from the standpoint of security and the prevention of violent offenses Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

The disease is apparently inherited as a dominant trait; x-linkage cannot be excluded. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam.

Probably because of methodological difficulties inherent in assessing this complex phenomenon, even the most commonly assessed outcome variables have produced contradictory results, with the exception of leaving or desiring to leave the psychologically abusive relationship. Some of the significant findings require more corroboration due to the small number of studies addressing them. The relative role of physical abuse in relation to psychological abuse has yet to be disentangled. Mediator/moderator variables are likely extremely important for explaining why particular consequences do not consistently result from psychological aggression. Although the hypothesized consequences/outcomes seem appropriate for further study, the most significant contribution may lie in intensive investigation of long-term, enduring psychological abuse that produces major personality and affective shifts in the recipient.",

If male partner aggression persists and escalates, it places the female partner at risk for affective consequences such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, marital discord, physical injury, and suicide. At a minimum, in assessing for a safety plan and interventions, clinicians should address duration, severity, and generality of psychological and physical aggression, level of marital discord, alcohol use, and personality disorders of the aggressor.",

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

      "abstract": "One hundred nine outpatients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were neuropsychiatrically evaluated and rated on standardized measures of depression, activities of daily living (ADL), nonmood behavioral disturbance, and burdensome events such as serious wandering, falls, and accidents. Distribution of depression scores revealed three patient groups: very few depressive symptoms (51%), minor depression (27%), and major depression (22%). Major depression was associated with substantially greater impairment in ADL, worse nonmood behavioral disturbance (such as aggression), and more frequent serious wandering, even after adjusting for severity of dementia or comorbid health problems. Minor depression was also associated with nonmood behavioral disturbance and wandering. The authors conclude that both major and minor depression are common in AD and produce considerable mood and nonmood morbidity affecting both patients and caregivers. Efforts are warranted to identify and treat depression in AD.",

      "title": "How sexuality is affected and managed in patients under antipsychotic drugs",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a prevalent side effect of antipsychotic drugs (AP), and it impairs patients’ quality of life. Because of the distress caused by it, it should be borne in mind when prescribed since it is responsible for treatment nonadherence or discontinuation. SD affects about 45- 80% of males and 30-80% of females that take it. In SD, all phases of the sexual response cycle may be compromised. Objectives This non-systematic review of the literature aims to better understand the antipsychotic-induced SD and its management to better compliance of AP-treated patients without compromising their quality of life. Methods A semi-structured review on PubMed linking SD as a side effect of AP drugs. Results All AP drugs can cause SD. It seems related to their mechanism of activity at receptors D2, 5-HT2, α1, H1, and M, which are also involved in sexual function. They do it by diminishing arousal, decreasing libido by blocking motivation and reward system and orgasm indirectly, provoking erectile dysfunction by vasodilatation, and decreasing woman lubrification. Hyperprolactinemia is a significant cause of sexual dysfunctions. Haloperidol, Risperidone, and Amisulpride (prolactin elevating AP) are more likely to cause SD than Olanzapine, Clozapine, Quetiapine, and Aripiprazole (prolactin sparing AP). Although psychotic disorders (Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders) can impact sexual functioning, according to evidence, there is no denying the role of AP in this issue. Aripiprazole, a D2 partial agonist, has been associated with lower rates of SD and seems to reduce the rates of SD in patients previously treated with other AP. Other AP with the same potential dopamine agonist activity, such as Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, can probably have the same effect. The management of SD induced by AP drugs should include measuring serum prolactin and modifying risk factors like hypertension, smoking, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia. In that regard, waiting for spontaneous remission, reducing the dose of the AP prescribed, or switching to Aripiprazole are all viable strategies, if possible. Although the evidence supporting the addition of symptomatic therapies is weak, adding dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, cabergoline) or drugs with specific effects on sexual functioning (such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors or yohimbine) may be helpful in selected cases. Conclusions Although all AP drugs can cause sexual dysfunction, it is difficult to determine its true prevalence accurately. AP-induced sexual dysfunction can adversely affect compliance and is one of the factors that must be considered when selecting treatment. In summarizing, Aripiprazole has shown to be the AP with the most favorable profile concerning SD. Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, being also D2 partial agonists, may cause less SD.

      "title": "Psychosocial therapies in addictive disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders form a significant part of global disease burden. With the increasing trend of use of psychoactive substances, the detrimental effects associated with it also increases. Individuals with substance use disorders are heterogeneous with respect to a number of clinically important features and domains of functioning. The pathophysiology of these addictive disorders is complex, not always linear and can be described as a complex bio-psycho-social process, coordinated by the neurological, vascular and endocrine systems. Apart from these biological factors psychological, physiological, environmental, and cultural factors are also invariably associated with use of a particular substance, and may have an independent intervening effect on the patient's overall quality of life and long term outcomes. Care of individuals with substance use disorders includes conducting a complete assessment, treating intoxication and withdrawal syndromes when necessary, addressing co-occurring psychiatric and general medical conditions, the achievement of abstinence or reduction in the use and effects of the substance, reduction in the frequency and severity of relapse to substance use, and improvement in psychological and social functioning, developing and implementing an overall treatment plan. Methods of intervention for achieving the above objectives vary from pharmacological to behavioral or psychosocial and from singular specific therapies to a broad array of services within a program. The role of psychosocial interventions has been especially underutilized and under studied in this patient population. Treatment services have been developed to address not only the substance use, but also the range of other problems that often predate, co-occur with, and are caused by these substance use disorders. These issues can include family or social relationships, legal matters, job or vocational concerns, medical conditions, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying the magnitude of these problems and managing them effectively may have a significant impact on the prevention of relapse. The importance of developing best practices and clinical guidelines in this area is therefore essential. The essential concepts underlying the management of addiction and related disorders are adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment. As in other areas of health-care, increasing attention is now being focused on providing evidence-based care for persons with substance use disorders and in this context there has been significant progress in the development and standardization of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. Psychosocial treatments are now considered essential components to any comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common psychosocial management approaches for these disorders. They can be implemented individually or in groups and delivered by a range of health workers. Psychosocial treatments are considered to be the foundation of drug and alcohol treatment, especially for substances where pharmacological treatments have not been sufficiently evaluated. The highlights of this book includes a comprehensive overview of the various psychosocial assessment tools, intervention strategies, the efficacy of a community based approach as well as the use of innovative approaches such as digital technology in formulating an adequate psychosocial management approach. There is a need for research on psychological interventions in special populations such as adolescents, the geriatric population, poly drug misuser, those with medical comorbidities, people with psychiatric comorbidity and other specific groups like LGBT, the tribal population and those with physical impairments. The recent literature regarding the same has been highlighted in this book. Maintaining the ethical frame is paramount in the therapy room and this extends to any intervention research which involves human participants. The chapter on ethics examines the debates and recommendations concerning key ethical issues in research on psychotherapy and various psychosocial interventions. Healthy family interaction and regular treatment follow up with support of family has proved to be the major protective factors of abstinence after treatment. These family based interventions would promote the quality of social support to the individual and it has been documented that social support when supplemented with effective community based interventions is a crucial factor in recovery. These guidelines outline this very model and addresses the importance of training primary health care doctors, NGO staff, volunteers, counselors, college & school teachers, strengthening self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in case identification, diagnosis, referral to treatment, providing long term care and rehabilitation services of patients with addiction disorders.. We hope that these guidelines would help in facilitating proper management of patients presenting with various types of substance use disorders and that the information provided will be of interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare professionals.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CSF1R-related adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is characterized by executive dysfunction, memory decline, personality changes, motor impairments, and seizures. A frontal lobe syndrome (e.g., loss of judgment, lack of social inhibitors, lack of insight, and motor persistence) usually appears early in the disease course. The mean age of onset is usually in the fourth decade. Affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity and rigidity. The disease course ranges from two to 30 or more years (mean: 8 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical and brain MRI findings and is confirmed by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CSF1R. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive management includes: attention to general care and nutritional requirements; antiepileptic drugs for seizures; and antibiotic treatment for general and recurrent infections. Prevention of secondary complications: Information about and support systems for the social problems and suicidal tendencies often associated with disease progression. Surveillance: Periodic brain MRI and clinical evaluation to monitor disease progression. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Use of first-generation neuroleptics due to increased seizure risk and risk of additional parkinsonian signs; medications used to treat multiple sclerosis as they are of no benefit and have major side effects. Genetic counseling CSF1R-related ALSP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with CSF1R-related ALSP usually have an affected parent; de novo mutation can occur. Each child of an individual with CSF1R-related ALSP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in a family is known.",

Pacientes portadores de insuficiencia renal cronica tem, geralmente, sido submetidos a dois tipos de tratamento: a dialise peritoneal e a hemodialise. O numero de pacientes que sao submetidos a dialise peritoneal e da ordem de 2% a 5% dos renais cronicos e o restante desta percentagem sao submetidos a hemodialise. Todo paciente cronico apresenta algum tipo de comprometimento emocional, podendo afetar diversos aspectos da vida do individuo, tais como: relacionamentos, autoestima, qualidade de vida e esperancas de sobrevivencia. Com o problema renal, ainda podem ocorrer alteracoes psicologicas, emocionais e intelectuais. Esse trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o nivel de estresse em renais cronicos que eram submetidos a hemodialise e verificar se a intervencao de relaxamento fisiologico poderia reduzir os niveis de estresse. A pesquisa foi realizada apos ter sido aprovada pelo Comite de Etica da UniFil, com criterios de inclusao e exclusao. Foi aplicado um questionario com perguntas fechadas, avaliacao de nivel de estresse e avaliacao de experiencias recentes. Foram selecionados dois grupos para pesquisa, um de controle e outro de intervencao,nos quais os escolhidos eram pacientes renais cronicos com diagnostico ha mais de tres anos, realizavam hemodialise de duas a tres vezes por semana e com idade superior a vinte anos. Apos essa selecao, foi aplicado o inventario de sintomas de estresse para adultos de Lipp (ISSL), para verificar se o relaxamento progressivo de Jacobson produziria a reducao de estresse nesta populacao. Verificou-se que os sintomas do nivel de estresse diminuiram e que alguns pacientes passaram da fase de exaustao para a fase de resistencia. A predominância do estresse antes psicologico passou para fisico/psicologico. Acredita-se que essas mudancas ocorreram devido a intervencao atraves do relaxamento aplicado. Diante dos resultados significativos com relacao ao estresse, sugere-se uma intervencao terapeutica visando a reducao de estresse com os renais cronicos, no qual se obteve grande exito na pesquisa realizada.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this analysis was to highlight the significance of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive mood disorders in older adults, as well as to expand the knowledge of social educators and geragogists regarding the basic symptoms of depression. Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction occurs in men and women and the prevalence increases with age. Dysfunction can occur in one or more areas of the normal sexual response cycle: desire, arousal, or orgasm. It can also be due to pain. Family physicians should routinely screen all men and women for sexual dysfunction, given its high prevalence and high correlation with other conditions. Risk factors include use of prescription drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, diuretics, antihormonals), recreational drugs, alcohol, and/or nicotine; certain health and lifestyle issues; and many chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. Diagnosis is based on clinical features; therefore, a detailed sexual history and focused physical examination are critical. Laboratory testing, imaging, and management are tailored to the suspected condition. Although some therapies require referral, education of patients about the normal sexual response cycle, discontinuation or changing of drugs, screening for and management of comorbid conditions, and counseling and guidance about lifestyle changes or use of devices all can be addressed in the family medicine setting.",

Por consiguiente, su sospecha clínica en este género es muy baja. Este síndrome con frecuencia se encuentra asociado a fatiga, síntomas depresivos y disfunción sexual, aunque no se cuenta con evidencia suficiente que correlacione esta entidad con antecedentes de trauma testicular y alteración de la relación testosterona libre - globulina transportadora de hormona sexual masculina (SHBG).Presentamos el caso de un paciente masculino de 40 años con cuadro clínico de 6 meses de evolución de astenia, adinamia, dolor generalizado, pérdida progresiva de peso, síntomas depresivos y disfunción sexual con antecedente de vasectomía, quien fue valorado por múltiples especialidades, recibió tratamiento con antidepresivos y benzodiacepinas que produjeron mejoría parcial de la sintomatología. Posteriormente, de acuerdo con recientes criterios del Colegio Americano de Reumatología (ACR) se diagnosticó fibromialgia asociada a bajos niveles séricos de testosterona libre y globulina transportadora de hormonas sexuales.En la literatura no hay evidencia rotunda que correlacione traumas testiculareso posteriores a vasectomía con aparición de disfunción sexual, disminución de la relación testosterona libre - globulina transportadora de hormona sexual masculina y posterior aparición de fibromialgia en hombres.

In only 14.5% of cases the pre-manifest period was characterized by personality accentuation. Analysis of cases of the latent course of the disease has made it possible to distinguish three main variants of its clinical manifestations: hypoparanoid, psychopathy-like and neurosis-like. On the basis of these findings a conclusion can be drawn that most of the cases of schizophrenia manifested in old age by the syndrome of involutional paranoid belong to a group of diseases with an early onset, prolonged torpid or latent course, and with increased progression of the process in advanced age.",

Moreover, anxiety is a risk factor for the development of other psychiatric conditions, including major depression. Numerous studies have identified evidence of sex differences in anxiety disorders, and there is considerable research concerning factors that may contribute to vulnerability for anxiety in females. In addition to psychosocial influences, biological components such as the female reproductive hormone cycle have also been implicated. Although psychotropic medication is more likely to be prescribed to women, there is little controlled data available concerning sex differences in the efficacy and/or tolerability of pharmacotherapy in anxiety disorders.

      "abstract": "Objective: There are several kinds of male genital pain which can cause mental suffering. Usually, they emerge during ordinary urological or andrological examinations. These distresses, sine materia, can be divided into different groups. Design and Method: The first group, which is the most frequent one, mainly affects the testicles; usually, this kind of distress last all life and it is often associated with surgery and/or frequent examinations to the genitals during childhood. The second group encompasses cases of real penodinia: the patients express their discomfort especially uncovering the glan and, for this reason, this action is never done. This distress is not always referred to as pain, but more often as bothersome. Sexual intercourses are permitted. Often the patients undergo a circumcision that usually has a complicated postoperative course. The males of the third group correspond to the women suffering from vaginismus. The patients do not even tolerate the approach of the hand to the penis and they make the same actions and the same movements as the vaginismic women. The patients are unable to have sex. This phenomenon is rare. In a perspective of multi-disciplinary and integrated methodology, the patients were treated with traditional surgery and/or with administration of drugs and/or with sexual therapy according with the integrated Kaplan method and/or with techniques for the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor. Results: Some clinical cases will be presented and discussed. Conclusions: The Authors describe new categories of male genital pain, never defined before, similar to Vulvodynia or Vaginism in women.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction and Associated Psychiatric Comorbidities Impacting Quality of Life in Epilepsy: A Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Epilepsy is caused by dysfunction in the brain, which is characterized by an enduring disposition for unprovoked seizures that reoccur often, along with the neurological, cognitive, psychological, and social effects of the condition, which are often managed with prolonged and sometimes lifelong medications that involve antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). To confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy, at least two unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart should be reported. This illness affects both children and adults. Patients with epilepsy are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to the general population, which often leads to a poor quality of life. The pathophysiology involved consists of the impact of epilepsy and AEDs on the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, consequently resulting in a high risk of developing testicular or ovarian dysfunction, leading to sexual dysfunction in epilepsy patients. Aim: This review aims to highlight various studies focusing on the association of developing the risk of sexual dysfunction with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly depression and anxiety, that impact the quality of life in epilepsy patients. Methodology: The search methodology involved articles from the Google Scholar and PubMed databases published between 2018 and 2023. \"Sexual dysfunction\", \"epilepsy\", \"depression\", \"anxiety\", and \"quality of life\" were the keywords used to search the articles. The Boolean operator \"AND\" and \"OR\" were used in between the keywords used. Following this, a total of 15 articles were included in the review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: The review concluded that epilepsy patients are often affected by sexual dysfunction along with associated psychiatric comorbidities that mainly involve depression and anxiety, consequently impacting their quality of life, as demonstrated by various studies. Sexual dysfunction is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in epilepsy patients due to the stigma attached to it. Hence, neurologists must keep a high index of suspicion for this problem. Furthermore, screening and monitoring for sexual dysfunction should be added to the usual epilepsy work-up.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality. This paper will present the current understanding of SE, identifying gaps in our knowledge. The evidence base for the pharmacological management of SE will be reviewed.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "title": "Atypical presentation of acute idiopathic megacolon in a 14-year-old patient",
      "abstract": "In clinical practice the term &ldquo;megacolon&rdquo; is used to indicate a marked dilatation of the cecum and the sigmoid colon (&gt;12 and 6.5 cm, respectively) (1). From a clinical standpoint, a megacolon can be classified as chronic or acute depending on its clinical presentation. Chronic megacolon typically refers to a congenital disorder in which the enteric nervous system (ENS) supplying the colon does not develop properly, thereby leaving the distal segments of the viscus without myenteric and submucosal ganglia (i.e. Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease) (2). Other cases of non-aganglionic chronic megacolon can be secondary to variety of conditions such as Chagas&rsquo; disease and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases), leading to or associated with ENS abnormalities (3). The acute form of megacolon, also referred to as Ogilvie&rsquo;s syndrome, is characterized by a predominant involvement of the cecum and right colon usually affecting elderly patients undergoing surgery (e.g. orthopedic procedures) or taking medications altering gut motility (e.g. opioids or antidepressants) (4). Some forms of acute megacolon, however, can be idiopathic in origin since no underlying etiology can be identified. Patients with acute idiopathic megacolon usually have a longstanding history of constipation, often accompanied by laxative abuse, and their clinical presentation is characterized by abdominal distension and severe pain with radiological evidence of stool impacted in the colon and rectum (1, 4). The case herein reported represents an unusual form of acute idiopathic megacolon characterized by massive descending and sigmoid colon distension complicated with a volvulus in a 14-year-old boy with no Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. In addition, just to increase the peculiarity of this case report, the patient had an unremarkable clinical record, and never suffered from chronic constipation in the past.",

This modality shows strong limits namely in the case of sudden and unexpected violent behaviours, of adhesion to terrorist groups or to criminal regimes, of somatic pathologies, of deficiencies in the development of functions. Utilising psychoanalytic, or psychoanalytically inspired literature, history documents, and clinical examples, a different assessment modality is proposed, both of pathological conditions and of the outcome of treatment: classification of levels of health is based on the degree of connection between different systems of the organism, which are also strongly related to the development of functions, such as dreaming, reflective capacity or affect regulation. Psychic, but also somatic symptoms often appear in this view not as the essence of pathology but as useful alarm signals and forms of communication; at any rate, they should be considered in conjunction with the proposed dimension.",

      "title": "Efecto de la suplementación con probióticos en la epilepsia farmacorresistente",
      "abstract": "La epilepsia es una enfermedad cerebral definida por una de las siguientes condiciones: - al menos 2 crisis no provocadas que ocurran con una separacion de al menos 24 horas - una crisis no provocada con la probabilidad de tener mas crisis en los proximos 10 anos similar al riesgo general de recurrencia (al menos 60%) de dos crisis epilepticas no provocadas, - diagnostico de sindrome epileptico (grupo de entidades que se identifican con seguridad por un conjunto de caracteristicas electroclinicas).\nEn Espana segun el estudio EPIBERIA se calcula que la epilepsia tiene una prevalencia de un 0,6%, lo que supone que en nuestro pais hay cerca de 280.000 pacientes que padecen esta enfermedad. Actualmente se han disenado farmacos antiepilepticos con los que se consigue un control de crisis en la mayoria de los casos. Pero queda un 25-30% restante en el que el tratamiento no es efectivo y el paciente sigue presentando crisis, lo que se denomina: epilepsia farmacorresistente. Para este tipo de epilepsia tambien hay tratamientos: el uso combinado de farmacos, la cirugia, la colocacion de estimuladores o la utilizacion de la dieta cetogenica. A pesar de estos ultimos tratamientos comentados (los cuales no estan indicado para todos los pacientes), seguimos teniendo un grupo de pacientes que sigue presentando crisis, con la perdida de calidad de vida y aumento de mortalidad que esto conlleva.\nEs en la busqueda, por mejorar el control de las crisis y la calidad de vida de estos pacientes, donde surge la hipotesis de este trabajo: el uso de probioticos en la epilepsia farmacorresistente.\nEsta idea surgio, en base a estudios actuales, que ponen en relacion la interaccion entre la microbiota y el sistema nervioso central, lo que se denomina como: eje microbiota-intestino-cerebro o en ingles brain En los ultimos anos cada vez hay mas articulos que relacionan ambos organos y que se han propuesto como etiopatogenia de diferentes enfermedades neurologicas como pueden ser el Parkinson, el Alzheimer, la migrana, la Esclerosis Multiple, e incluso ya hay un estudio de hace unos meses que lo relaciona con epilepsia. \nNuestra hipotesis fue, que modificando la microbiota, gracias a la administracion de probioticos, podriamos mejorar el manejo de las crisis en pacientes epilepticos farmacorresistentes. Esta hipotesis la basamos en 4 supuestos: 1.- La generacion de neurotransmisores inhibidores por parte de la microbiota intestinal, como puede ser el GABA, que favorecen la inhibicion de crisis.\n2.- El poder antiinflamatorio de los probioticos, que estaria actuando sobre uno de los mecanismos etiopatogenicos de la epilepsia, la inflamacion.\n3.- La posible modificacion de la microbiota y su posible implicacion en la epilepsia 4.- La accion de la microbiota sobre el metabolismo de los farmacos. \nEl estudio fue aprobado por el comite de etica de nuestro Hospital. \nSe realizo un estudio cuasi-experimental donde cada paciente fue su propio control (para evitar el sesgo de la diferencia del numero de crisis; pero con la limitacion de que no tiene comparador contra placebo).\nEn el estudio participaron 45 pacientes que acudieron un total de 4 veces. La visita inicial fue para proponer el estudio, validar criterios de inclusion y exclusion y firma del consentimiento informado; ese dia se inicio un registro de recogida basal de crisis de 3 meses. La visita 2 es el momento de inicio de los probioticos que tomaron durante 4 meses. En la visita 3 se comprueba la efectividad de los probioticos (con el control de reduccion de crisis gracias al registro de las mismas) y se realiza una visita mas, 4 meses despues para comprobar si la efectividad persiste a pesar de la suspension del tratamiento. En cada visita se realizo una toma de constantes, peso y analitica de sangre, orina y heces y un registro de control de crisis, adhesion al tratamiento y calidad de vida.\nLos resultados de nuestro estudio son positivos, de tal manera que hemos encontrado una reduccion de crisis de mas del 50% (reduccion minima establecida para poder considerarse efectiva en los ensayos clinicos sobre epilepsia) en el 28,9% de los pacientes.\nSe ha obtenido una mejora en la calidad de vida (clinica y estadisticamente significativa) y una comprobacion de la seguridad de los probioticos en nuestro estudio.\nRESUMEN BIBLIOGRAFIA:\n1.- Serrano-Castro PJ, Mauri-Llerda JA, Hernandez-Ramos Fj, Sanchez Alvzrez JC et al.

Hence, we report the clinical profile and outcome of relapses in three cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. All three patients presented with relapse of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). They had symptoms such as dyskinesias, seizures, and cognitive decline. Relapse of AE was defined as new onset or worsening of symptoms after an initial improvement or stabilization of at least 2 months. All three patients had a diagnosis of single relapse of AE. There was an average delay of relapse of 1 year (range 0.5–1.5 years). All cases presented with partial features of the typical anti-NMDAR encephalitis (psychiatric manifestations, speech disorder, seizures, orofacial dyskinesias, and decrease of consciousness). The main symptoms of relapses were speech dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and dyskinesias. Relapses of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis may present over a long period and are usually not very severe at the onset or during the course of the illness. Aggressive immunotherapy at the onset of the illness seems to decrease the risk of relapse.",

      "title": "The epidemiology of pain in depression",
      "abstract": "Over 75% of depressed patients in primary care complain of painful physical symptoms such as headache, stomach pain, neck and back pain aswell as non-specific generalized pain. The presence of such symptoms predicts a greater severity and a less favourable outcome of depression with a poorer health-related quality of life. World Health Organization data obtained in primary care centres worldwide show that 22% of all primary care patients suffer from persistent debilitating pain and that these patients are four times more likely to have co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorder than pain-free primary care patients. Not unexpectedly, the risk of depression is greater when the pain is more diffuse, as indicated by the number of painful sites, and has a greater effect on the quality of life. Certain depressive symptoms, such as low energy and sleep disturbances, are commonly found in patients with co-morbid pain, whereas the opposite is true for symptoms such as guilt and loneliness. Increasingly, major depression is seen as being composed of psychological, somatic and painful physical symptoms. In order to achieve full sustained remission it is necessary to treat symptoms in all three of these areas. The area of painful physical symptoms is unfortunately still poorly understood and clearly merits greater attention. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Although physical and cognitive impairments after stroke have been well studied, little is known about sexual functioning and satisfaction in these patients, despite being crucial aspects of quality of life. Post-stroke sexual dysfunctions seem to be common; in men affected by stroke, a decline in libido and poor or curtailed erection and ejaculation are frequently observed. Sexual disorders after stroke are thought to be due to multiple etiologies, including both organic (e.g., lesion localization, premorbid medical conditions, medications) and psychosocial (e.g., fear of recurrences, loss of self-esteem, role changes, anxiety and depression) etiologies. Thus, the exploration of sexual dysfunction and sexual counseling by trained professionals should be part of stroke rehabilitation.",

While such symptoms arise from an estrogen-deficient state of the menopause, these also occur in certain major psychiatric disorders, especially those of depression. Thirteen and twenty-one percent of the women were diagnosed as depression and masked depression, respectively. The incidence of generalized and panic disorder was 6.7% in each. The ill-defined syndrome of the menopausal age may be severe and persistent enough to meet the diagnosis of a major psychiatric illness, i.e. depression.

      "title": "Differing roles for parvalbumin neurons after nerve injury",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is abnormal, persistent pain that is caused by injury to the somatosensory system. It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia.

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania.

A personality disorder is “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time and leads to distress of impairment” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Dangerous behaviors (i.e., violence or suicide attempts) are mostly found among individuals with personality disorders included in Cluster B Category: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic Personality Disorders. Individuals with Cluster B Personality Disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, and/or erratic. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which is in Cluster A, talk about violence but are usually not violent (Tardiff, 1998). The other personality disorders in Cluster A, Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders, and those in Cluster C (Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders) are not dangerous although occasionally violent or suicidal behaviors may occur if they feel angry or depressed or have an accompanying Axis I disorder, which is linked to violent or suicidal behavior. Some individuals with mental retardation are violent as a consequence of frustration and an inability to express themselves verbally.This chapter will focus on personality disorders in Cluster B and Paranoid Personality Disorder, since these are the most frequent and challenging cases where the clinician must decide whether the patient is a short-term risk for violence or suicidal behavior.",

Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease. In addition, the state of uncertainty allows the patient to activate the resources of coping with the disease, among which the leading role belongs to social support.",

All patients who presented with stupor, (a) partial or total mutism or (b) absent or decreased motor responses (n = 22), were compared with patients who also had classical catatonic signs such as negativism or waxy flexibility (n = 43) over a one-year period (1988), on sociodemographic and clinical variables. There were very few significant differences between the two groups (age, sex, diagnosis, duration of illness, number of ECTs required). The stupor group had a slight excess of patients with manic-depressive psychosis, depression and more frequently positive family histories of mental illness. The current study provides a tentative support to the hypothesis that stupor is a catatonic sign, and even when present alone can be considered to constitute a catatonic syndrome.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Lower dyspeptic syndrome is a bowel disease manifesting namely with pain or sensation of abdominal discomfort and bowel movement problems (changes in the frequency and stool consistency). Symptoms include sensation of intraabdominal pressure and fullness, diarrhoea (with or without pain), sensation of incomplete defecation, constipation or bowel movement problems (with or without pain), irregular stool, collywobbles and bowel content flow (borborygia with spasms), meteorism, flatulency. Prevalence of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the European population is estimated to be 5 to 25 %. In the Czech Republic the total prevalence of dyspepsias is about 13 %. To the pathogenesis of the lower dyspeptic syndrome contribute: 1. abnormal motility, 2. abnormal visceral perception, 3. psychosocial factors, 4. luminal factors, 5. imbalance of neurotransmitters and/or intestinal bacteria and 6. possible inflammatory changes of the intestinal mucosa. Infectious diarrhoea is one of the causes. Functional bowel defects represent various combinations of chronic and recurrent symptoms from the digestive tract which cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional defect manifesting with abdominal pain, intestinal dyspepsia and compulsive defecations. Subtypes with typical symptomatology are characterized by circumstances which bring about pain and compulsive defecations (morning fractional defecation, postprandial defecation, debacles). Functional diarrhoea manifests with diarrhoea without intensive pain. Spastic obstipation manifests by abdominal pain, obstipation, compulsive defecations are absent, stool is cloddish, fragmented by spastic haustration, or it has a ribbon-form. Changes in the intestinal chemism include fermentative and putrefactive dyspepsia. Among the incomplete and atypical forms the isolated meteorism, irregular defecation, flatulency, abdominal pain--syndrome of the left or right epigastium or the syndrome of the right hypogastrium can be included. In patients with typical set of symptoms the working diagnose of the lower dyspeptic syndrome can be done by general practitioner. Complete history of the disease can reveal possible extra abdominal cause of dyspepsia, recognise alarming symptoms and consider circumstances elevating or lowering the probability of functional problems. Functional bowel problems have usually long-term character and represent clinically demanding challenge. Only few therapeutic regimens are successful and the therapy aimed at the abolishment of one symptom need not bring general improvement. For the clinical studies of the therapy of functional bowel problems significant placebo effect is typical. Quoad vitam prognosis is good, quoad sanationem it is rather doubtful.",

      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors affect resistance to a wide variety of diseases in animals. Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availablility of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "abstract": "Mrs. C, age 48, has depression and extreme anxiety. She has tried several antidepressants, but discontinued them because of side effects. What could be causing her medication intolerance? CASE Medication sensitivity Mrs. C, age 48, is admitted to a tertiary care inpatient mood disorder unit for evaluation of severe depression characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, and insomnia. Her initial Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 17-Item (HRSD-17) score is 30, indicating severe depression. Her medications are fluoxetine, 10 mg/d, and diazepam, 0.5 mg/d. Mrs. C describes a 10-month history of depression and extreme anxiety in the context of several psychosocial stressors. Her father recently died and she is having difficulty with the demands of administering her father's estate. She is intensely obsessive and focused on nihilistic themes, her diagnosis, somatic themes, and medications side effects. Her husband confirms our observations. No history or current symptoms of typical compulsions (eg, washing hands or checking doors) are elicited. She has limited insight into her obsessive tendencies. Mrs. C had no psychiatric history before her depressive and obsessive symptoms developed 10 months ago. However, in the past 10 months, she has been hospitalized in a psychiatric facility twice. She also received a series of 8 electroconvulsive therapy treatments, but reported minimal improvement of her depressive symptoms. Mrs. C had a few cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions with a psychotherapist, but she said they didn't help much. Mrs. C has substantial difficulty adhering to medications, even at subtherapeutic doses. She states she is extremely sensitive to all medications. Mrs. C says she develops dizziness, increased anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and other vague reactions whenever she attempts to increase her psychotropics to therapeutic doses. She took sertraline, 10 mg/d, for 4 days, but discontinued it because of unspecified side effects. She then received escitaiopram, 2.5 mg/d, for 10 days, but again stopped it because of vague side effects. She was taking paroxetine, 10 mg/d, for 2 days, but experienced vomiting and discontinued the drug. She tried venlafaxine at a low dose and also discontinued it because of vomiting. Mrs. C stayed on mirtazapine, 22.5 mg/d, for 3 months, but stopped it because of lack of efficacy and she was unwilling to increase the dose. Other unsuccessful trials include citalopram and doxepin. Mrs. C is hesitant to try another medication or increase to therapeutic doses any of the previous medications. How would you treat Mrs. C? a) prescribe a low dose of another antidepressant b) increase the diazepam dose to 10 mg/d c) prescribe lithium or an atypical antipsychotic d) initiate pharmacogenomic testing e) restart CBT The authors' observations Before initiating another treatment, the treatment team considered Mrs. C's pervasive medication intolerance. Her enzymatic activity may be genetically compromised, which could lead to high blood levels of medications and significant side effects when she takes very low doses. Individual variations in response to psychotropics are influenced by genetic factors. (1) Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes produce enzymes with increased activity, normal activity, reduced activity, or no activity, creating phenotypes of ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, respectively. These genetic variations can affect blood levels of medications that employ these enzymes in their metabolic pathways. (2) Mrs. C could be a poor metabolizer of common CYP450 variant enzymes, which led to her exquisite sensitivity to psychotropics. We felt this was a reasonable hypothesis given her tumultuous 10-month course of psychiatric treatment and multiple failed medication trials. An alternative hypothesis is that Mrs. …",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "abstract": "Like nonaffected adults, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show the entire range of sexual behaviors. However, due to the core symptoms of the disorder spectrum, including deficits in social skills, sensory hypo- and hypersensitivities, and repetitive behaviors, some ASD individuals might develop quantitatively above-average or nonnormative sexual behaviors and interests. After reviewing the relevant literature on sexuality in high-functioning ASD individuals, we present novel findings on the frequency of normal sexual behaviors and those about the assessment of hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors in ASD individuals from our own study. Individuals with ASD seem to have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors than general-population studies suggest. However, this inconsistency is mainly driven by the observations for male participants with ASD. This could be due to the fact that women with ASD are usually more socially adapted and show less ASD symptomatology. The peculiarities in sexual behaviors in ASD patients should be considered both for sexual education and in therapeutic approaches.Al igual que los adultos normales, los sujetos con trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) presentan toda la gama de conductas sexuales. Sin embargo, debido a los síntomas centrales del espectro del trastorno, que incluyen déficits en las destrezas sociales, hiper e hipo sensibilidad sensorial y conductas repetitivas, algunos sujetos con TEA pueden desarrollar intereses y conductas sexuales hipernormales o no habituales. Se revisa la literatura más relevante sobre la sexualidad en sujetos con TEA de alto funcionamiento y se presentan los nuevos hallazgos provenientes de los estudios del grupo de trabajo sobre la frecuencia de las conductas sexuales normales y sobre la evaluación de las conductas y fantasías hipersexuales y parafílicas. Al parecer los sujetos con TEA tienen más conductas y fantasías hipersexuales y parafílicas que lo sugerido por estudios en población general. Sin embargo, esta inconsistencia se debe principalmente a las observaciones realizadas en los hombres con TEA. Esto podría deberse al hecho que las mujeres con TEA están más adaptadas socialmente y presentan menos síntomas del TEA. Las peculiaridades en la conducta sexual de los pacientes con TEA deben ser tomadas en cuenta para la educación sexual y en los abordajes terapéuticos.Comme les adultes non atteints, les personnes ayant un trouble du spectre de l'autisme (TSA) présentent le tableau complet des comportements sexuels. Cependant, certaines personnes ayant un TSA peuvent développer des intérêts et comportements sexuels hypernormaux ou non standard, à cause des symptômes fondamentaux du trouble, comme les déficits de socialisation, les hyposensibilités et hypersensibilités et les comportements répétitifs. Après une analyse de la littérature pertinente sur la sexualité des personnes ayant un TSA de haut niveau, nous présentons des données nouvelles, issues de notre propre étude sur la fréquence des comportements sexuels normaux et sur l'évaluation des comportements et fantasmes hypersexuels et paraphiliques chez les personnes ayant un TSA : celles-ci semblent avoir de tels comportements plus souvent que les études de population générale ne le suggèrent. Cependant, cet écart est principalement le fait des observations des participants masculins ayant un TSA, peut-être parce que les femmes ayant un TSA sont habituellement plus adaptées socialement et moins symptomatiques. Les particularités des comportements sexuels des patients ayant un TSA devraient être prises en charge à la fois pour une éducation sexuelle et des approches thérapeutiques.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria.

Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

A severe, chronic brain disorder, schizophrenia is characterized by an onset in early adulthood, a lifelong course, debilitating symptoms, deterioration in functional ability, and lack of social acceptability, making it among the most disabling, and economically catastrophic disorders.2 Symptoms appear in men in their late teens or early 20s, whereas women are generally affected in their 20s or early 30s.3 In the U.S., annual direct and indirect costs of the disorder total more than $62 billion.4\r\n\r\nFour symptom clusters have been observed in large groups of patients.5 Positive symptoms (psychosis) are correlated with hospital admission and a first-time diagnosis. Delusions are the most common psychotic symptom and occur in 65% of patients with schizophrenia.6,7 Hallucinations and disorganized thinking occur in approximately 50% of these patients. Auditory hallucinations are the most common sensory disturbance, but visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations may occur.8 Most patients experience a combination of delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorganization.6\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms represent a loss of affective responsiveness, verbal expression, personal motivation, enjoyment, social drive, or attention to the environment.9 All cognitive domains are also affected by the disorder, including attention, language, memory, and executive function.10 The combination of blunted, inappropriate, and odd expressions is the most common affective disturbance in schizophrenia.11 Depressive symptoms are the most common mood disturbance in schizophrenia.12\r\n\r\nIn 2002, direct annual health care costs were estimated at $22.7 billion for the U.S., $7.6 billion in other direct costs, and $32.4 billion in lost economic productivity and caregiver costs, for a total of $62.7 billion.4 Schizophrenia accounts for 2.5% of all health care expenditures, 25% of hospital beds, and 20% of all Social Security benefit days. 13 Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia, with alterations in neurotransmitter pathways (e.g., with dopamine) and enlarged sulci and ventricles found on brain imaging.14",

      "abstract": "The increase in socialist industrialization has seen the great increase in levels of industrial noise, as well as the increase of female industrial workers. The biological effects of vibrations depend on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the vibration. The most unfavorable are those with a frequency of 100-250 and an amplitude of .005 mm. General vibrations over a prolonged period of time lead to a typical syndrome of vegetative dysfunction and angiodystonic effects on a neurological basis. In the cardiovascular system, these effects are normally in the form of spastic reactions and perinephritis. The genital system function is particularly sensitive to vibrative disruptions, increasing with the frequency of the vibrations (such as with vehicle operators). Menstrual dysfunction is the most common of such disruptions. The cardiac, nervous, and muscular types of anomalies are well documented. What is now encouraged is research into prophylatic measures to prevent such disruptions.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "Similarly as nearly all processes taking place continuously in the organism pain shows also frequently a circadian rhythm. In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine.

L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient.

For chronic pain this leads to big costs by repeated technical examinations and often even to iatrogenic injury to the patient as a result of diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Psychogenic pain patients are particularly afflicted by this process of chronification. The results of a study investigating 151 chronic patients show, that psychogenic pain patients (PP, n = 75) are significantly different from those whose pain was caused by organic factors (OP, n = 35) regarding their development in childhood and adolescence (in the sense of a marked emotional deprivation). Including additional parameters raised by a structured interview (SBAS) and the trait-score of the STAI an identification of PS is possible with high sensitivity and specificity (about 95 percent). By the aid of the maturity of defence mechanisms three taxonomic subgroups in PP can be differentiated (type A, B, C). Between these types there are significant differences regarding illness behaviour (e.g. medication abuse, \"doctor shopping\") and responsiveness to a psychological pain interpretation. The results confirm the necessity of a differentiation of chronic pain patients as to the etiology and pathogenesis and furnish even the physician without psychosomatic education with diagnostic criteria relatively simple to raise. By these criteria a prevention of chronification in a lot of pain patients is possible. Derived from the results a pathogenic model for psychogenic pain is developed.",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social.

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Rapid hormonal changes during pregnancy as well as psycho-social stressors accompanying parenthood have often been associated with peripartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder or with not yet clinically expressed bipolar diathesis. Yet, little is known about the correlation of peripartum onset of bipolar disorder in men. We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder with peripartum onset and subsequent episodes following the peripartum initiation of the disease, as well as the association of the couvade syndrome, as a pathological response to a man due to hormonal shifts observed in males cohabiting with a pregnant female. The patient had his first depressive episode during the peripartum period of his spouse, followed by two mixed episodes with psychotic features that leaded to his compulsory psychiatric evaluation and subsequent hospitalization and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I. There is a well-known correlation between the peripartum period and mood disturbances to the point of inducing full blown episodes, suggesting of a bipolar disorder initiation or mood episodes relapsing in female patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Due to the patient's psychological disturbances and the phenomenology of his symptoms, mainly concerning the psychotic features accompanying his episodes, we discuss the possible underlying biological correlates as a triggering mechanism, that might overlap the manifestation of the Couvade Syndrome as well as the initiation or relapse of Bipolar Disorder in males. It seems that males are not less influenced by hormonal and psycho-social factors posed upon them during the peripartum period of their cohabiting female spouse.",

Continuous symptomatology, brain matter loss, cognitive deterioration, excess somatic comorbidity, and premature mortality are seen throughout the life span.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

The SED term encompasses certain diagnostic categories, including autism spectrum dis-order, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other severe anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The commission also reported that, in a given year, about 5–7% of adults have a serious mental illness (SMI). The SMI term has traditionally been defined in terms of diagnosis, duration, and disability. Specifically, the term refers to mental disorders that carry certain diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression; that are relatively persistent; and that result in comparatively severe impairment in major areas of functioning, such as vocational capacity or social relationships.",

Depressie heeft een slechtere prognose als er tegelijkertijd een lichamelijke ziekte bestaat, en het beloop van somatische aandoening is ongunstiger bij mensen met een depressie. Bijna driekwart van de patienten met een depressie en een chronische lichamelijke aandoening waren niet als depressief gediagnosticeerd door hun huisarts, zoals blijkt uit het ontbreken van een geregistreerde diagnose depressie in hun medisch dossiers. Depressieve, lichamelijke zieke patienten die daarbij ook nog een andere psychische stoornis hadden (meestal een angststoornis) werden vaker als depressief gediagnosticeerd door hun huisarts (37%) dan de lichamelijke zieke patienten die alleen depressief waren (16%). Huisartsen gaven enige vorm van zorg bij nieuw ontstane depressie bij een patient met een chronische somatische aandoening in 86% van de gevallen. Patienten met een ischemische hartaandoening of hartritmestoornis hadden minder kans op enige vorm van depressiezorg (in vergelijking met patienten zonder chronische lichamelijke ziekte). Meestal werd door de huisarts begonnen met behandeling met antidepressiva. Het hebben van een (specifieke) lichamelijke aandoening had geen invloed op de kans dat antidepressiva continu werden voorgeschreven gedurende tenminste zes maanden. Er is behoorlijk wat ruimte voor verbetering van de diagnostiek en behandeling van comorbide depressie bij chronische lichamelijke ziekte in de huisartsenpraktijk. (aut. ref.)",

Abstract The purpose of this project is to present the Escala Crespo-Bujosa de Sintomas Neurologicos Discretos (Crespo-Bujosa Neurological Soft Sign Scale). It has the purpose of carrying out a quick screening of the symptoms experimented by individuals with real neurologic indicators. Neurological Soft Signs (NSS) are defined as mild neurological irregularities, however, unequivocal, of primary sensory-motor functions. This behavioral and motor indicators do not necessarily have a systematic relation with a neuropathology. However, they may indicate neurological deterioration, developmental immaturity or an intermediate in the continuum in a lesion process. A transversal study was carried out with sample of 411 participants per disponibility with a majority of them being females (77.7%). The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 94 years. 43% of the participants had received a neurological diagnosis (e.g. Epilepsy or Migraine, etc.) or neuropsychological (e.g. ADHD). Through structural equations it was found that the model has a good adjustment to evaluate the construct of NSS. The instrument shower a good adjustment and reliability. Each sub-scale measures a different dimension of NSS without redundancy between them. The item discrimination analysis ranged between .55 - .78 with a explained variance R 2 in the items per factor between .46 and .74. The discrimination indexes were at the minimum recommended of .30. The final scale groups the symptoms in three dimensions: a) neurocognitive symptoms, b) somatic symptoms and c) psychological symptoms.

      "title": "Prolactin elevation with antipsychotic medications: mechanisms of action and clinical consequences.",
      "abstract": "Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.",

      "title": "“Just Make it Stop”: A Case Report of Excessive Crying in an Individual with Dementia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Nearly all persons diagnosed with dementia exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia1 (BPSDs; aggression, wandering, tearfulness). Pharmacological interventions are commonly prescribed to manage BPSDs but are only moderately effective and are associated with significant adverse effects2-4 (e.g., movement disorders, sedation, and death). Also problematic, these interventions medicate globally and do not necessarily manage problems observed under finite conditions (e.g., aggression during showers, disruptions during drop-off at day center). It is essential to describe experiences in which nonpharmacological interventions are successful in treating these complex symptoms. Herein is presented an innovative approach to managing one type of BPSD—excessive crying—in a particular setting (on van rides home from a day center). An 89-year-old woman diagnosed with severe vascular dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score 0) and severe aphasia exhibited high rates of crying on van rides home from her adult day center. Staff reported that the behavior was loud, constant, and emotionally distressing to the other riders. The woman was referred for intensive behavioral services after pharmacological interventions (lorazepam, quetiapine, sertraline, trazodone) and traditional nonpharmacological interventions (music therapy, sensory stimulation) failed to decrease crying. A single-subject reversal-design study,5 a type of n-of-1 trial, was used to evaluate the effects of two behavioral interventions on her excessive crying during van rides home. In a reversal design, an intervention is administered and removed repeatedly. Observations are made before, during, and after interventions. Experimental control is demonstrated if behavior changes only when the intervention is in place. Experimental control is verified when behavior change is replicated across multiple presentations and withdrawals of the intervention. Data are plotted on simple line graphs for visual analysis and interpretation. After interviewing transportation staff, trained behavioral therapists observed the woman on multiple rides home. Every 15 seconds, she was scored as calm or crying, and the status of the van (i.e., park, drive) was recorded. Observations revealed that crying most often occurred during stops (Figure 1, Sessions 1–4, Baseline, shaded circles). The authors hypothesized that some adverse event (e.g., stopping but not being allowed off the van), delayed access to pleasurable events (e.g., arriving home), or both influenced the crying. After the woman was observed repeatedly during baseline, the first intervention (warning signs) was implemented; as soon as the van drove away from the day center and throughout the van ride home, therapists informed the woman of the distance to her house, held signs, and provided reminder statements (e.g., “You have three stops left”). This intervention was conducted for 6 consecutive days (Figure 1; Sessions 5–10). Warning signs did not consistently reduce crying. Before the second intervention, a return to baseline was conducted to verify behavioral persistence in the absence of treatment (Figure 1, Session 11). A differential reinforcement intervention was tried next; as soon as the van drove away from the day center and throughout the van ride home, the therapists delivered a highly preferred item—food—contingent upon calm behavior. If the woman cried at the time of food delivery, the therapist reminded her to stay calm and did not deliver the item. The woman had access to the preferred item (food) only when she was calm. Differential reinforcement was conducted during Sessions 12–14 and reduced crying to near-zero levels. After a brief return to baseline (Session 15), the effects of the intervention were replicated (Session 16). BPSDs are common and difficult to manage and can negatively affect an individual quality of life and risk of institutionalization.1, 2 This particular woman was in danger of losing access to transportation services because of the severity of her crying and the distress it caused others. Transportation services were a necessity for this woman, because the caregiver could not drive her to the day center, and the day center was a necessity for the woman to reside at home. (It provided caregiver respite.) Differential reinforcement is a common behavioral procedure used to decrease challenging behavior and increase appropriate behavior and was successful at reducing crying in this case. Three previous case studies6-8 demonstrated that differential reinforcement is an effective intervention to decrease persistent crying in individuals with dementia living in nursing homes, but this is the first demonstration of its effectiveness during transportation services. Some complicating factors limited the case report. First, day center staff were not actively involved in the intervention, and therefore the application of these behavioral interventions by traditional direct care employees is unknown. Staff continued to attend to the other day center attendees while trained behavior therapists conducted the treatment sessions with the woman. The next phase of the study would have incorporated staff into the procedures, but the woman had a catastrophic fall the day after Session 16 and was no longer able to attend the day center. Clinicians should provide highly preferred activities and items contingent upon appropriate behaviors. In addition, clinicians who are unable to manage complex behavioral symptoms using traditional methods should consider collaborating Board Certified Behavior Analysts®,9 who specialize in challenging behaviors exhibited by older adults. These practitioners are uniquely qualified to assess environmental etiology and prescribe nonpharmacological interventions customized to individual needs.

      "title": "Nicht-konvulsiver Status epilepticus des Erwachsenen: Typen, Pathophysiologie, Epidemiologie, Ursachen und Diagnose",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Der nicht-konvulsive Status epilepticus (NKSE) ist gekennzeichnet durch andauernde elektroklinische epileptische Aktivität oder durch eine Abfolge von epileptischen Anfällen, zwischen denen der Patient nicht zum Vorzustand zurückkehrt, und die ohne eindeutige tonische-klonische Entäußerungen einhergehen. Diese „stille“ Manifestation andauernder klinisch-neurologischer Symptome wie Aphasie, Verwirrung, etc. erschwert das Erkennen eines NKSE; oft ist der wichtigste Diagnoseschritt, überhaupt daran zu denken, dass die vorliegende Klinik auf einem NKSE beruhen könnte. Sicher nachgewiesen und bestätigt werden kann der NKSE nur durch eine unmittelbare EEG-Ableitung. In epidemiologischen Studien scheint der konvulsive Status epilepticus (KSE) häufiger (60 : 40 %) vorzukommen, doch dies ist fraglich, werden doch viele NKSE aufgrund der unspektakulären Manifestation verpasst. Pathophysiologisch spielen sich auf neuronaler Ebene dieselben Phänomene wie beim KSE ab, einfach nur nicht in den primären Motoneuronen. Die permanente Hyperexzitabilität kann die vom NKSE betroffenen Neuronen genauso schädigen. Hingegen fehlen die unmittelbar vital bedrohlichen sekundären pathophysiologischen Folgen des KSE (Lactat-Azidose, respiratorische Erschöpfung, Rhabdomyolyse, etc.) beim NKSE weitgehend. Doch auch dort können autonome Phänomene (Arrhythmien [Kammertachykardie oder Asystolie] und Atmungsprobleme) den Patienten akut lebensgefährlich gefährden. Die Ursachen für einen NKSE sind vielfältig und umfassen bei Patienten mit einer bekannten Epilepsie v. a. Medikationsprobleme (mangelnde Adhärenz, Interaktionen bei Zugabe anderer Medikamente); bei ihnen sowie denjenigen Betroffenen ohne bekannte Epilepsie kommen metabolische, toxische, strukturelle (Tumore, Blutungen, Ischämien), infektiöse, entzündliche und autoimmune Ursachen in Frage. Entsprechend breit sollte die Ursache für einen NKSE abgeklärt werden, da besonders bei den akuten symptomatischen Formen die Behandlung der Ursache mindestens so wichtig ist wie die anfallsbeendende Behandlung des NKSE.",

This condition is one of the most common sexual problems for men and increases with age, but it's not a natural part of ageing. Approximately one half of men aged 40 years and older have erection problems. Most men have difficulty achieving an erection from time to time, and such occurrences are considered normal. However, ED may be a regular and more severe problem in some men. It can cause low self-esteem, performance anxiety, depression and stress, and may also affect the quality of a marriage or intimate relationships. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, participating in more exercise, stopping smoking and minimising the risk of heart disease, may help to improve the condition. The introduction of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of ED. Surgery may be considered when these inhibitors and other approaches fail or are contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are frequently presented in primary care.1 In about 25–50% of all symptoms presented in primary health care, no support for an underlying physical disease can be found. MUS are a heterogeneous group of symptoms and can involve almost all types of symptoms that patients present to their GP. Functional somatic syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as symptoms stemming from a specific somatic disease that are more severe, more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected, based on (objective) disease parameters, are also referred to as MUS. MUS represent a spectrum of severity from mild via moderate to severe, characterised by an increased number and duration of symptoms and functional limitations. Most of the time MUS are transient and self-limiting, but sometimes MUS persist, resulting in extensive investigations and referrals and unnecessary healthcare costs. Therefore, early recognition of MUS is of paramount importance. Although only 2.5% of the patients in general practice meet criteria for persistent or severe MUS (such multiple symptoms that persist for longer than 3 months resulting in severe functional limitations), GPs experience many difficulties in caring for these patients.2 For that reason the Dutch College of General Practitioners decided to publish the evidence-based primary care guideline on MUS, which provides …",

It arises as a result of organizational change such as implementation of change process or downsizing which is the reflection of response to external changes such as changing dynamics of economies like recession, intense competition; political situations and adaptability. Not only the victims of lay-off suffer from Lay-off Survivor Sickness but also the survivors who remain within the organization go through the same feelings. These conditions sometimes last for months or even years and demographic characteristics of survivors can also influence the duration of lay-off survivor sickness  which do not only affect the employees (Survivors) and their families but also the organizations which sometimes fail to achieve their desirable objectives through downsizing or change process.",

      "title": "[The role of psychosocial stress in childhood for structural and functional brain development:neurobiological basis of developmental psychopathology].",
      "abstract": "This review summarizes some important principles of human brain development. Special emphasis is placed on the role of psychosocial stress during childhood on the developing brain. Depending on the degree of cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional maturation, previous experiences and actual context, psychosocial stressors may be perceived by children as being either controllable (challenge) or uncontrollable (disaster). Controllable stress experiences are associated with a preferential activation of the central and peripheral noradrenergic system, i.e., of a system endowed with the gating of cortical information processing and the facilitation and stabilization of neuronal pathways and synaptic connections involved in behavioral responding. Uncontrollable stress responses are elicited if all previously acquired behavioral or cognitive strategies are inadequate or fail to overcome the stressor. The resulting severe and long-lasting activation of the central stress responsive systems will finally lead to a full activation of the HPA system, accompanied by adrenocortical cortisol release. The major central effect of this response is the destabilization of previously established neuronal circuits and synaptic connections. Thus, severe uncontrollable psychosocial stress may act as an important trigger of and a prerequisite for the reorganization of neuronal connectivity. It may, above a certain threshold, threaten the mental and affective stability, integrity, and the future development of a child. The long-term consequences of psychosocial stress on the structural and functional maturation of the brain are documented by findings from animal research and by results in the field of developmental psychopathology in children. The role of risk and protective factors during different phases of child development is briefly summarized and the need for a biopsychosocial model concerning the relationship between human brain development and behavior is emphasized.",

      "title": "A new syndrome? The sport identification addiction and the case of Italian football ultra-fanatical support",
      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

AS is caused by loss of function of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (<i>UBE3A</i>) gene. Most cases of AS (70%) are caused by an approximate 5 Mb deletion in chromosome 15q11-q13 of the maternally derived allele; other causes include paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (5%), imprinting defects (5%), and <i>UBE3A</i> mutations (10%), with the genetic cause yet to be determined in the remaining 10% of cases. Many seizure types are present in AS, with myoclonic, absence, and tonic–clonic seizures being common. Characteristic findings of electroencephalography in AS include persistent rhythmic theta activity, anterior dominant rhythmic high-amplitude delta (2–3 Hz) activity or spikes and slow waves, and posterior dominant spikes and sharp waves mixed with 3 to 4 Hz high-amplitude slow waves. <i>UBE3A</i> has been shown to regulate both the glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic systems; further dissection of the molecular mechanisms of <i>UBE3A</i> action in mouse models and individuals with AS would facilitate a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy.",

Its presence is associated with high depression scores, higher age, low performance on frontal tasks, and more severe deep white matter hyperintensities. In late-life depression, lack of interest or motivation are often more prominent than depressed mood, especially in the late-onset type. It was hypothesized that in a heterogeneous sample of elderly depressed patients, apathy is associated with late-onset type of depression, cognitive dysfunction or vascular risk factors.The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) was administered to twenty-nine elderly (> or = 60 years) inpatients with a DSM-IV major depression or dysthymic disorder. The severity of the depression was measured with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and cognitive function with the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). The presence of vascular risk factors was traced in the patient's medical records.Apathy was found in 86% of the patients. The AES-score was correlated with the negative symptom score, but not with total MADRS or MMSE-score. No difference in AES-score between early-onset depressed (n = 16) and late-onset depressed (n = 13) patients was found, and between patients with or without vascular risk.Apathy is a main feature of moderate to severe depressive illness in elderly patients and related to the negative symptoms of the disorder.

The serotonergic disturbances found in some depressed individuals, particularly those with lowered CSF 5-HIAA, are linked to the anxiety and aggression components of the depressive syndrome. In this type of depression, called 5-HT-related depression, dysregulation of anxiety and/or aggression is hypothesized to be primordial and mood-lowering is a derivative phenomenon. In other words, this is a group of anxiety/aggression-driven depressions. The author submits that the serotonergic impairment in certain types of depression is a trait phenomenon, i.e. it persists during remission. This disturbance makes the individual susceptible to perturbation of anxiety and aggression regulation. Anxiety and (overt or suppressed) anger are core constituents of the stress syndrome. Thus the serotonergic disturbance will induce a heightend sensitivity to stressful events, i.e. the latter will induce stress phenomena, including anxiety and anger, more readily than normal. The latter psychological features induce lowering of mood, and thus 'drive' the patient into a full-blown depression. Furthermore, it is predicted that anxiolytics and serenics (i.e. anti-aggressive drugs) that act via normalization of serotonergic circuits will exert an antidepressant effect in 5-HT related depression, in addition to their therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders and states of increased aggressiveness, respectively. The exact nature of the serotonergic impairment in 5-HT-related depression has yet to be elucidated.",

It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Con el nombre de demencia se denomina un sindrome complejo de naturaleza organica, adquirido, caracterizado por la presencia de un deterioro permanente de la memoria y otras funciones intelectuales, frecuentemente acompanado de otras manifestaciones psicopatologicas y alteraciones del comportamiento, que ocurre sin afectacion del nivel de conciencia ni depresion, y afecta al funcionamiento laboral y/o social del sujeto. La demencia es un sindrome clinico de etiologia multiple, por lo general de curso cronico y progresivo, pero no necesariamente irreversible. El principal factor de riesgo para las formas mas comunes de demencia, como la enfermedad de Alzheimer, es el envejecimiento. La demencia bien establecida afecta al 8% de las personas de edad igual o superior a 65 anos. Para una poblacion estimada en Espana de 7.576.309 de personas es este grupo de edad, podemos establecer una cifra de sujetos afectados que sobrepasa holgadamente el medio millon. Esta cifra puede doblarse si consideramos tambien las formas leves de sindrome demencial. Hasta el 75% de las personas mayores que residen en una institucion padecen alguna forma de deterioro cognitivo clinicamente significativo, un sindrome demencial en la mayoria de los casos. La tasa de conversion de pacientes con demencia leve o deterioro cognitivo significativo a casos confirmados de demencia se situa en el 10-12% anual. Las enfermedades que cursan con demencia imponen una sobrecarga intensa sobre los pacientes y sus cuidadores, lo que las transforma en uno de los problemas sociosanitarios mas acuciantes en nuestro pais. Las entidades que pueden dar lugar a una demencia son muy numerosas. Suelen considerarse 3 grandes grupos etiologicos: demencias degenerativas primarias (p. ej., enfermedad de Alzheimer); demencias secundarias (p. ej., demencia vascular) y demencias combinadas o de multiple etiologia (p. ej., demencia mixta o demencia tipo Alzheimer con enfermedad cerebrovascular asociada). La forma de demencia mas comun es la enfermedad de Alzheimer (60%), seguida de la demencia vascular (15-20%) y la demencia asociada a la enfermedad de Parkinson (10-15%). Estas formas mas frecuentes de demencia son irreversibles, pero hay que tener en cuenta que un 5-10% de las demencias son potencialmente reversibles, y entre ellas hay que destacar las asociadas al empleo de farmacos. El resto de las etiologias son infrecuentes y por lo tanto irrelevantes desde la practica en atencion primaria. Siguiendo el esquema propuesto por el Consenso Canadiense de Demencias, se exponen a continuacion las situaciones clinicas caracteristicas que suelen presentarse en atencion primaria, junto con una pauta de actuacion basada en los conocimientos actuales.",

Menopozla ilişkili semptomların ana nedeninin kadınlarda östrojen düzeylerindeki kayıptan kaynaklandığına dair kanıtlar vardır. Menopoz genellikle sıcak basması, idrar bozuklukları, eklem ağrısı ve psikolojik sıkıntı gibi çeşitli sağlık şikayetleriyle ilişkilidir. Menopoz semptomlarını bildiren kadınların genel sağlık durumu genellikle daha kötüdür. Menopoz sırasında ve sonrasında birçok kadında depresyon (mutsuzluk, sinirlilik, ağlamaklılık, enerji eksikliği) veya anksiyete (ruh hali değişiklikleri, uykusuzluk, kalp çarpıntısı, panik atak, unutkanlık veya odaklanma ve konsantrasyon sorunları) belirtileri görülmektedir. Egzersiz, bilinen az sayıda yan etkisi ile uygun maliyetli bir alternatif yöntem olup, egzersizin menopoz semptomları, depresyon ve yaşam kalitesi üzerinde olumlu etkisi olduğu da gösterilmiştir. Ayrıca egzersizin kemik, kardiyovasküler, metabolik, diyabet, kanser, uzun ömür, psikolojik sağlık ve genel yaşam kalitesi üzerinde pek çok faydasının olduğu açıktır. Bu nedenle kadınların menopoza geçiş dönemi ve sonrasında fiziksel olarak aktif olması uygundur. Sonuç olarak sağlık profesyonellerinin kadın yaşamında önemli bir yere sahip olan menopoz ve sonrası dönemde kadın sağlığını korumak ve yükseltmek için kadınların egzersiz yapmalarına teşvik edilmesi ve farkındalık oluşturulması önemlidir.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "abstract": "Definition of somatoform disorders: somatic symptoms or mental symptoms? Somatoform disorders, which used to be considered as mental disorders, are frequent, especially in the context of non-psychiatric medical consultations. The absence of an identifiable organic cause for these disorders often leads clinicians to underestimates their harmful consequences or even challenge their validity as disease. However, they are real disorders that may have a major impact on the quality of life and functional outcomes of the subject and whose mechanisms can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. Although psychiatric classifications support a unitary approach (i.e. the \"somatic symptom disorder and related disorders\" of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - or the \"bodily distress disorder\" of the World Health Organization), each non-psychiatric specialty has described some \"functional somatic syndromes\", which are deemed more specific and less severe regarding psychiatric severity, and thus more often remain in the field of non-psychiatric specialties. In this article, we have presented the initial stage of any medical approach of suffering: a clarification of the issues involved in the delimitation of the normal and the pathological, and the organization of the different categories between them. These nosographic aspects are the condition of a rigorous approach in medicine, and of a relationship with the patient that is useful to understand and relieve his or her genuine suffering.Définition des troubles somatoformes : entre symptômes physiques et symptômes mentaux. Les troubles somatoformes, considérés comme des troubles mentaux par la nosographie psychiatrique, sont particulièrement fréquents, mais surtout rencontrés dans le contexte des consultations médicales non psychiatriques. L’absence de cause organique identifiable pour ces maladies fait souvent sous-estimer leur retentissement, voire douter de leur existence. Il s’agit pourtant de troubles à part entière, avec un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie et les activités des sujets en souffrant et avec des mécanismes accessibles à la thérapeutique. Si la nosographie psychiatrique contemporaine privilégie une approche unitaire (« troubles à symptomatologie somatique et apparentés » du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, « bodily distress disorder » de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé), chaque spécialité a décrit un ou plusieurs « syndromes somatiques fonctionnels » qui, du fait de leur spécificité présumée et de leur sévérité psychiatrique moins grande, restent le plus souvent du domaine des spécialités non psychiatriques. Dans cet article est présentée l’étape initiale à toute approche médicale de la souffrance : une clarification des enjeux de la définition du normal et du pathologique et de l’organisation des différentes catégories nosographiques entre elles. Ces aspects nosographiques sont la condition d’une approche rigoureuse en médecine et d’une relation avec le patient qui soit utile à la compréhension et au soulagement de sa souffrance.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

Patients with apathy exhibit a marked decrease in goal-directed behavior, and the primary clinical feature is a lack of motivation accompanied by indifference, low social engagement, poor persistence, and a lack of initiation. Apathy is a syndrome that is distinct from depression. The cardinal symptoms of depression are pervasive feelings of sadness or anhedonia, accompanied by sleep and appetite changes, feelings of hopelessness, and guilt and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, patients with apathy (with or without depression) exhibit greater deficits on measures of executive function than patients rated as dysphoric, providing additional evidence that the two disorders are distinct.",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

In spite of a high prevalence of sexual disorders secondary to psychopharmacological agents, there is a paucity of studies in the medical literature that clearly document the magnitude of the problem. Most reported instances of sexual disorders etiologically related to psychotropic medication are found in case reports and case series. The differential diagnosis of sexual dysfunction includes the sexual disorders associated with mental illness. In order to identify the etiology of sexual dysfunction in a patient with a mental disorder, the clinician must take a careful sexual history during the initial phase of treatment. Most patients do not spontaneously report sexual dysfunction to their therapists during the first session [1]. Decisions about prescribing psychotropic agents without establishing the baseline sexual functioning of a patient may obfuscate the process of differentiating between a sexual dysfunction caused by medication and one preexisting secondary to a mental disorder. Underreporting by patients during the initial interview does not preclude clinicians' exploring data",

      "abstract": "Depression is a universal experience, which affects approximately 15 percent of the population at any one time. Depression can be conceptualized as occurring on a continuum from first-level transitory to middle-level to severe-level depression. It involves an alteration in mood characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, the client's usual activities and pastimes. Alterations in thought, motor activity, somatic sensations, and social relationships are also associated with depression. Severe depression can also be associated with delusional thought patterns. Finally, depression can vary in length of duration; it can be transitory and short-lived or ongoing and chronic. Assessment of individual, family, and community factors is important in identifying the factors relevant to planning individualized care for the depressed client and his/her family. Nursing diagnosis includes problems of low self-esteem, feelings of despondency, suicidal thoughts/impulses, and vegetative signs of depression. Nursing interventions are guided by certain principles, and are best evaluated when expected client behaviors have been projected. In conclusion, the overwhelming majority of those who experience depression recover and achieve a higher level of wellness than before the depression; that is, if they use the opportunity to develop a more realistic view of self, others, and their world relationships.",

Partly due to the less visible symptoms, these diagnoses can stay unnoticed for a long time. This is a problem which developmental disorders and acquired brain injuries have in common. This delay leads to broad psychosocial problems and/or a vulnerable position in society. This study maps the experiences of adults (18 to 65 years) with regard to the diagnosis of a developmental disorder or an acquired brain injury in Flanders (Belgium): 26 adults with one or more recent diagnoses of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability or neuropsychological symptoms after an acquired brain injury were interviewed. Common experiences were searched through an interpretative phenomenological analysis using the software program Nvivo™. The challenges of symptoms prior to receiving a diagnosis are often great. Adults have been looking for answers for a long time. The accessibility of diagnostic services in Flanders is experienced as limited. Primary and secondary care providers play a crucial role in timely referral, but participants experience a shortage of knowledge and expertise among them. For many participants, receiving a diagnosis is the first step in accepting further treatment, although they report a substantial need for a more seamless transition from diagnosis to guidance and advice.",

Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

The causes of the effects of cervical myelopathy may be the appearance of lesions on the spinal cord, ischemia due to compression of the vertebral artery and repeated micro-injuries during maximal movements—hyperflexion or hyperextension. It is well known that lesions on the spinal cord may occur in a quarter of the population, and this problem is clearly noted in people over 60 years old. The symptoms of SCM develop insidiously, and their severity and side (unilateral or bilateral) are associated with the location and extent of spinal cord compression. Neurological examination most often diagnoses problems in the upper limbs (most often paresis with developing hand muscle atrophy), pyramidal paralysis in one or both lower limbs and disorders in the urinary system. To make a diagnosis of CSM, it is necessary to perform MRI and neurophysiological tests (such as EMG or sensory and/or motor-evoked potentials). The use of appropriately selected scales and specific tests in diagnostics is also crucial. This narrative review article describes the latest knowledge on the diagnosis and clinimetrics of cervical spondylotic myelopathy in adults and provides future directions.",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "title": "Characterization of the Roman lines/strains of rats as agenetic model of psychiatric disorders: a behavioral andbrain dialysis study",
      "abstract": "State of the art Depressive disorders are fairly prevalent in the general population, with a higher rate in women compared to men, are disabling, since they can significantly impair psychosocial functioning, and are typically associated with high mortality due mainly to the high rate of suicides but also to the negative impact that depression has on the course of co-occurring illnesses. In addition, pharmacological and psychological antidepressant therapies in use have a limited efficacy and/or are associated with side effects that reduce the compliance in many patients. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of depression are poorly understood, it is most likely that the combination of genetics, early life adverse events, and ongoing stress may ultimately determine the individual vulnerability to stress-related disorders, such as depression. Therefore, the development and characterization of animal models of vulnerability and resistance to the effects of stress, including early life stress, is a major challenge for depression research.\r\nOne such model is represented by the Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) lines/strains of rats, which are psychogenetically selected for, respectively, rapid versus extremely poor acquisition of active avoidance in a shuttle box. A large body of evidence indicates that a major reason for their divergent performance in this test is their different reactivity to stressful stimuli, that is, their coping style. Thus, when exposed to aversive stimuli, RLA rats display a reactive coping strategy, associated with a strong activation of the HPA axis; moreover, they display robust depressive-like behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) that are normalized by the subacute administration of antidepressants. In contrast, compared with their RLA counterparts, RHA rats display a proactive coping strategy in the face of aversive conditions, associated with higher baseline levels of impulsivity, a more robust sensation/novelty seeking profile, a marked preference for, and intake of, natural and drug rewards along with a greater responsiveness of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system.Aims The behavioral and neurochemical traits that distinguish the two lines/strains suggest that RLA rats may represent a model of vulnerability to stress-induced depression, whereas RHA rats may model resistance to stress-induced depression-like behaviour.\r\nTo test this hypothesis, in the first study we evaluated the performance of RLA and RHA rats in the FST in response to chronic antidepressant treatments, since clinical evidence indicates that several weeks of treatment with antidepressant drugs are required to achieve an adequate therapeutic response.\r\nFurthermore, one of the cardinal symptoms of depression observed in many patients is anhedonia, which is defined as the loss of interest in once enjoyable activities, including sexual activity. Accordingly, depressive episodes are frequently associated with sexual dysfunctions. In consideration of this clinical evidence, and given the well-established role of dopamine in sexual behavior, the second study was aimed at characterizing the sexual behavior of RHA and RLA rats and its correlation with the functional state of their mesolimbic dopaminergic system.\r\nIn keeping with the long-term consequences on mental health elicited by early-life adverse events, it has been observed that post weaning social isolation in rodents may lead to a later increment in the prevalence of anxiety/fear related behaviors. Thus, in the third study we evaluated the impact of post weaning isolation on the anxiety-related behaviors of inbred RHA and RLA rats in the Elevated Zero Maze, and in motility cages used to asssess locomotor activity in a new environment.\r\nResults In study I we demonstrated that chronic treatments with low doses of antidepressants, that were ineffective when given subacutely, were able to decrease immobility and also to increase climbing (desipramine) or swimming (fluoxetine) in RLA rats. Conversely, neither subacute nor chronic antidepressant treatments affected the behavior of RHA rats in the FST.\r\niii\r\nIn addition, the results of study II showed that, compared with their RLA counterparts, RHA rats displayed higher levels of sexual motivation and a better copulatory performance, associated with a greater release of DA in the AcbSh. These line-related differences were attenuated but not abolished by sexual experience. Moreover, RLA rats were more responsive than their RHA counterparts to both, the facilitatory effect of apomorphine and the inhibitory effect of haloperidol on sexual behavior.\r\nFinally, in study III we found that the isolation-rearing procedure significantly increased the level of anxiety of RHA-I rats in the EZM, as reflected by a smaller number of entries and a shorter time spent in the open space, associated with decreased head dipping, increased latency to enter in the open space, and reduced novelty-induced locomotor activation, whereas it failed to produce significant changes in the behavior of RLA-I rats.\r\nConclusions The results of these studies show that the Roman lines/strains of rats may represent a valid experimental approach to investigate the neural substrates and molecular mechanisms involved in the individual vulnerability and resistance to stress-induced depression, with the aim of identifying both, potential biomarkers for an early diagnosis of depression and potential molecular targets for novel antidepressant treatments. Moreover, the Roman lines/strains may be used to study the neurophysiology of the appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behaviour, in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the psychological and pathological causes of sexual dysfunctions. Finally, the Roman rats may provide a useful model to identify the mechanisms whereby early-life adverse events interact with the genetic make up to induce psychiatric disorders in adulthood.",

      "title": "AB0543 Anxiety and depression in chinese patients with primary sjÖgren's syndrome",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder characterised by lymphocytic infiltration and exocrine failure of salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in the classical symptoms of the disease including xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjuctivitis sicca (dry eyes). pSS has the potential to impair both psychological state and the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). A common mental health problem among adults with pSS is anxiety and depression. In addition, depression is more common in pSS than in the general population and has been associated with enhanced fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life, increased levels of physical disability and increased health care costs. Besides, depressed pSS patients have poorer long-term outcomes, including more complications. Anxiety was more common than depression in pSS. The most affected domains were vitality in the SF-36 and general/physical fatigue in the MFI. Extraglandular systemic involvement was not a major determinant of QoL alteration in patients with pSS. <h3>Objectives</h3> Prevalence of anxiety and depression are high in women with Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS). Our aim was to compare anxiety and depression in pSS patients and healthy controls and evaluate its relationship with the disease activity, sleep and quality of life; as well as to analyze potential determinants of anxiety and depression. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty-seven patients fulfilling the American-European Consensus Group criteria for pSS (mean age 52.76 years (s.d. 13.16)) and 42 age-matched healthy controls were included. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires, namely Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In addition, the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren9s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI); Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and systemic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level) were recorded in patients. Independent samples t-tests, χ2 analyses and logistic regression modeling were used to analyze the data. <h3>Results</h3> pSS patients experienced greater anxiety and depression than controls (HADS-A scores: mean± SD 6.5±3.4 for pSS versus 3.8±3.4 for controls; <i>P</i> =0.002. HADS-D scores: mean± SD 6.7±4.1 for pSS versus 4.2±3.5 for controls; <i>P</i> =0.012). And there were significant correlations among fatigue, pain, disease activity, dryness, sleep, quality of life and anxiety/depression. Meanwhile, logistic regression analysis revealed that poor quality of life and ESSPRI were significantly associated with anxiety/depression in pSS patients. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The study suggests that optimal care of pSS patients may include the detection and management of anxiety and depression. Early recognition and appropriate intervention is therefore essential to reduce the negative impact of anxiety and depression on the patient9s quality of life and outcome of their disease. <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471603, 81172841); \"Top Six Types of Talents\" Financial Assistance of Jiangsu Province (Grant no. 10.WSN016). <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

Sexual dysfunction is a relatively common complication of antihypertensive drug therapy and has been associated with nearly all of the antihypertensive agents. The physiology of the normal sexual response, proposed mechanisms of sexual dysfunction, and the types of disorders and relative incidence rates associated with individual agents are discussed. Since a disturbance in sexual function may lead to poor compliance with the drug regimen, it is important that the clinician be familiar with this topic.

In particular, characterizing sexual disorders in patients with neurasthenia, one group of authors believes that these disorders differ depending on the form of this disease (hypersthenic, hyposthenic). In their opinion, in the hypersthenic form increased excitability of the sexual sphere is observed which can lead to the appearance of various sexual disorders, including increased libido. In the hyposthenic form of neurasthenia, according to this group of authors, various hypoactive sexual manifestations can be noted, including a decrease in libido, and in addition, premature ejaculation. Another group of researchers found in patients with neurasthenia, regardless of its form, only hypofunctional sexological manifestations, as well as premature ejaculation (that is, those symptoms that were named by the first group of authors as characteristic of the hyposthenic form of neurasthenia). The article also presents data on hypoactive sexual desire which can be observed in personality disorders and character accentuations (schizoid personality disorder and character schizoid accentuation, accentuations of the cycloid, asthenoneurotic, hysteroid, unstable, psychasthenic, sensitive and infantile-dependent types); mood disorders [affective disorders] (dysthymia [depressive neurosis], bipolar disorder); schizophrenia; mental retardations; dementia due to organic brain damages; epilepsy; organic brain damages; multiple sclerosis.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

To clarify the nature, etiology and evidence for cognitive and memory complaints during midlife, at the time of the menopausal transition, we have critically reviewed the evidence for impairments in memory and cognition associated with common comorbid psychiatric conditions, focusing on mood and anxiety disorders, attention-deficit disorder, prolonged stress and decreased quantity or quality of sleep. Both the evidence for a primary effect of menopause on cognitive function and contrarily the effect of cognition on the menopausal transition are examined. Impairment in specific aspects of executive function is explored. Evaluation and treatment strategies for the symptomatic menopausal woman distressed by changes in her day-to-day cognitive function with or without psychiatric comorbidity are presented.",

Although constitutional delay of growth and puberty is commonly seen and is often regarded as benign, there are many other causes of pubertal delay that ultimately result in permanent hypogonadism, and these must be differentiated from self-limited delays in maturation. Causes of hypogonadism include disorders affecting the gonads (primary hypogonadism) and abnormalities of pituitary or hypothalamic function (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may be part of a more global set of pituitary deficiencies or may be the only endocrine axis affected. A rapidly growing array of genetic disorders accounts for isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Treatment of delayed puberty often consists of short-term administration of sex steroids to those with constitutional delay, while individuals with permanent hypogonadism require long-term testosterone or oestradiol replacement.",

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

Zweifelsfrei aber sind die so genannten Grundstörungen (s. Kap. A 2.2.1) vorhanden. Man sieht Einbußen der Vitalität und Dynamik, Mangel an Initiative, Schwunglosigkeit, Verküm¬merung der zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen und des Realitätsbezuges, Autismus. Denkstörungen und leichte katatone Symptome sind im Ansatz zu erkennen. Meistens besteht die Erkrankung schon längere Zeit. Sie ist, insbesondere für die Angehörigen, als Krankheit nur schwer und sehr spät zu erkennen. Bei dieser Symptomkonstellation spricht man auch von einer Schizophrenia simplex (s. Kap. A 2.2.1).",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Frage des angemessenen Managements nach einem ersten epileptischen Anfall verursacht nicht selten Unsicherheit. Dies betrifft vier Themenbereiche: die Diagnostik; die Einschätzung des Rezidivrisikos; die Beratung des Patienten bezüglich einer antiepileptischen Pharmakotherapie sowie deren weiterer ärztlicher Begleitung; und die sozialmedizinische Bewertung (Fahreignung, berufliche Eignung). Methodik Zusammenfassung der relevanten Datenlage zu diesen Themenfeldern und daraus abgeleitete Empfehlungen zum praktischen Umgang mit ersten epileptischen Anfällen im erwerbsfähigen Alter. Ergebnis Nach der Klärung, ob es sich um einen epileptischen Anfall gehandelt hat, dient die Diagnostik einerseits dazu, akut-symptomatische und potenziell behandlungsbedürftige Ursachen zu erkennen, andererseits zur Abschätzung des Rezidivrisikos. Dieses hängt weniger davon ab, ob eine Epilepsie diagnostiziert werden kann. Risikoerhöhend sind vielmehr – auch additiv – das Vorliegen folgender Merkmale: epilepsietypische Aktivität im EEG, bildgebender Nachweis einer Hirnläsion, zerebrale Vorerkrankung oder Auftreten des Anfalls aus dem Schlaf. Je höher das Rezidivrisiko, desto stärker scheint der rezidivprophylaktische Effekt einer antiepileptischen Pharmakotherapie zu sein und desto eher wird man dafür optieren. Die Entscheidung hierüber wird gemeinsam mit dem Patienten getroffen unter Berücksichtigung seiner Präferenzen und seiner sozialen Situation (z. B. Angewiesensein auf die Fahreignung, berufliche Besonderheiten). In der weiteren Begleitung kommt der Sicherung der Adhärenz eine entscheidende Rolle zu. Für die Frist bis zur Wiedererlangung der Fahreignung und der Eignung, bestimmte berufliche Tätigkeiten (wieder) auszuüben, gibt es verbindliche Regelungen.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background : Miller Fisher Syndrome usually presents with complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "The first episode of psychosis is the interval between the onset of the first positive psychotic symptom above the threshold for clinical psychosis for at least 1 week until the first 5 years of starting treatment. The at-risk mental state is subdivided into three ultra high-risk populations for psychosis: brief intermittent psychotic symptoms; attenuated positive symptoms syndrome; genetic risk and deterioration syndrome. The incidence of psychotic disorders varies between 15-34/100,000 person-years at risk, most of the specific diagnoses are schizophrenia. The duration of untreated psychosis is the most studied variable and closely related to the assessment of the impact of early treatment on the patient's prognosis. Psychosis can be divided into primary (affective and non-affective) or secondary causes. Intervening early in the course of psychotic illness is important as centers specialized in FEP aim reduce DUP, achieve remission of the psychotic condition, reduce recurrence, and reduce the number of hospital admissions.",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of all the major mental illnesses with one year prevalence in European countries of around 5%, and with a range from 3.1% to 10.1%. Depressive Episodes are associated with disability and frequently have a long duration: in one third of patients the episode will last for more than 2 years, the criteria for chronic depression. Recurrence is predicted by a number of factors including severity of depression, number of prior episodes, time since previous episode and absence of remission or presence of subsyndromal symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes and the severity of the current episode: once a patient has suffered from three episodes of depression, he has more than 95% chance of having another. Although effective pharmacotherapeutic agents are available, depressed patients are often undertreated or treated for an inadequate period of time. Initial acute treatment of Major Depression results in a significant lessening of depressive symptoms (response) progressing to absence of depressive symptoms (remission) which means the return to the patient’s premorbid state. Stable remission for 46 months is thought of as a recovery. A worsening of symptoms or the return of a major depression is considered a relapse before recovery has been achieved and recurrence if it occurs later. The distinction between remission vs. recovery and relapse vs. recurrence is not possible. The three phases of treatment are: acute therapy; continuation therapy; maintenance therapy. The acute phase of therapy covers the time period from the beginning of treatment to remission, which is the primary therapeutic goal. The continuation phase follows the acute phase to preserve and stabilize the remission. It is the phase in which the treatment is extended for a period of time in order to prevent a return of depression. Long-term maintenance treatment is aimed at the prevention of a new episode of depression. Long-term tolerability is, therefore, important in facilitating adherence to treatment and thereby control over depressive symptoms. The new Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inihibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inihibitors (SNRIs) are generally better tolerated than older treatments, such as Tricyclic antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. Venlafaxine XR, with its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, has been shown to be superior in efficacy to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for severe Majors Depressive Disorder. Clinical studies suggests that it has a rapid onset of action, producing significant clinical improvement in the first or second week of treatment, and long-term efficacy and may have consistently superior remission rates compared with the SSRIs. Moreover Venlafaxine XR (extended release) was effective in 92% of depressed patients in preventing recurrence in the second year of maintenance therapy (Prevent Study).",

There has been little agreement concerning the origin of dyspareunia. Organic conditions and psychological variables have alternately been presented as major factors in causality. There is a presumed high incidence of physical disease associated with dyspareunia when compared with other female sexual dysfunctions. In the majority of cases, however, organic factors are thought to be rare in contrast with sexual issues and interpersonal or intrapsychic difficulties as a cause of continuing problems. The finding of an organic basis for dyspareunia does not rule out emotional or psychogenic causes. Thorough and extensive gynecologic and psychological evaluation is essential in cases of dyspareunia. The etiology of dyspareunia should be viewed on a continuum from primarily physical to primarily psychological with many women falling in the middle area.",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Affiliation: Implications for Autism",
      "abstract": "Abstract A decade from now, when we look back at the early years of affective neuroscience, we may wonder about our conspicuous preoccupation with “negative” emotions. Fear and anxiety, sadness and depression, anger and aggression have received considerable attention in the past few years. By contrast, the neurobiology of “positive” affects, such as joy, affiliation, and love, seem almost taboo subjects. No doubt our focus on negative emotions derives from a need to understand psychopathological states. Most major forms of psychopathology, such as the anxiety and affective disorders, involve an excess of one of the negative emotions. Recently, we have begun to appreciate that most mental disorders also involve a loss of positive affect, whether it is the anhedonia of major depressive disorder, the absence of affiliation in autism, or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. An important first step toward accounting for the loss of positive affects will be to understand their normal expression. Clearly, joy is not just the absence of sadness, and love/affiliation is much more than the absence of hate or fear. Positive affects will undoubtedly have a circuitry and a neurochemistry that is unique from what we have already learned about fear, sadness, and anger. But how can we study these complex affects with the modern tools of neurobiology? In this chapter, I review one approach based on animal studies. This approach demonstrates that current molecular and cellular tools, when combined with comparative, ethologically relevant studies, can reveal some intriguing leads into the neural basis of affiliation in nonhuman animals. Affiliation is an ethological term generally used to describe membership in a conspecific group. In fact, there are two quite different uses of the term affiliation. The first, relevant to all species, is sociality. Some highly affiliative species, including our own, cluster in flocks or herds in which group membership is essential for survival. Other, nonaffiliative species, such as orangutans or certain cats, are loners, living solitary lives except when mating or caring for young. A second use of the term affiliation describes specific aspects of behavior within a species. In this latter sense, affiliative behaviors include side-by-side or huddling behavior, parent-infant attachment, and pair bonding. Because these behaviors are most relevant to understanding the basis of the powerful human experiences of acceptance, attachment, and love, this chapter focuses on this second meaning of affiliation.",

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

This focuses on 9 areas of inquiry: the circumstantial lethality of the event; prior self-destructive behavior; depression; hostility; stress; reaction of the parent or parent surrogate; loss of communication; lack of resources; and extremes of parental expectations and control. Adolescents under severe familial and socioeconomic stress, and with a history of acting-out behavior, often respond well to transfer to a more favorable home situation. In cases where there is no apparent familial perturbation, the physician should be alert to the possibility of severe psychiatric disorder.

      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

Rarely can a definite injury be determined in the acute (or chronic) phase. Crash-related factors have been identified, and several trauma mechanisms possibly causing different injuries have been described. Most whiplash trauma will not cause injury, and the majority of patients (92-95%) will return to work. Litigation is not a major factor. Cognitive impairments are not the same as brain injury. Variables such as pain intensity, restricted motion, neurological symptoms and signs, together with central nervous system symptoms can be used to predict a situation with risk of remaining complaints. Influences of other factors--the same as for other chronic pain conditions--also exist. Persistent/chronic pain is not merely acute pain that persists over time; changes occur at different levels of the pain transmission system. Chronic whiplash-associated disorders are associated with problems concerning social functioning, daily anxieties and satisfaction with different aspects of life. Adequate information, advice and pain medication together with active interventions might be more effective in the acute stage. Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation focusing on cognitive-behavioural changes might be of value. To develop specific treatment and rehabilitation, it is important to identify homogenous subgroups.",

At the upper limb, flexion deformity of the wrist and the hand makes grasp and grip ineffective and spasticity of the Pectoralis Major muscle is considered as a main cause of sympathetic dystrophy. Neurolysis with alcohol injection in the nerve trunk or at the motor point destroys the gamma fibers and reduces spasticity, without impairing motor command. The effects on spasticity, motricity, and deformity of 33 chemical neurolysis with alcohol are analysed with a six months follow-up (27 hemiplegic patients, 28 to 62 years old, mean = 54.5). The authors have used 60% alcohol concentration. Sciatic nerve injection significantly reduces triceps spasticity (7/11), improves the range motion of the ankle, and allows the patient to take off the ankle device. Those fair results are still present at the fourth month after injection. Similar results are reported after injection of the obturator nerve for hip adduction deformity (2/3), median nerve injection for wrist and hand deformity (6/6). Pectoralis Major injection in the motor point is effective for 10 of the 13 cases, preventing sympathetic reflex dystrophy or contributing to its dramatic improvement.",

Nor has the influence which traumatic injuries to the head, syphilis, or other derangements possibly coincident with the abuse of alcoholics, by themselves exert, been taken into proper account in calculating the part of the latter in the spread, on a wide and increasing scale, of mental and nervous affections. Although this discrimination is by no means always practicable, we may yet arrive at it by diligent inquiry and with a material change in the results, as evinced by the cases we pass on to analyse.",

La enfermedad de Alzheimer es una condicion neurodegenerativa  caracterizada por deterioro cognitivo, conductual y del funcionamiento global, con un inicio insidioso y curso progresivo que aparece principalmente en la vejez. Por otro lado, la depresion es un trastorno del estado de animo que en altos niveles de gravedad muestra en adultos mayores alteraciones cognitivas significativas que pueden confundirse con un sindrome demencial. Se reporta el caso de una mujer de 75 anos de edad con datos de un probable trastorno depresivo mayor y con quejas de perdida de memoria desde hace 3 anos. A la evaluacion neuropsicologica se observan alteraciones cognitivas importantes en el funcionamiento mnesico ademas del funcionamiento ejecutivo, caracterizados por: una deficiente capacidad de aprendizaje de nueva informacion con respecto a lo esperado para su edad y nivel de escolaridad, una perdida importante de elementos visuales y auditivos a corto y largo plazo, ademas de una significativa presencia de perseveraciones e intrusiones, con un marcado deficit en el automonitoreo. Como apoyo los estudios de neuroimagen muestran disminucion del volumen cortical en regiones temporoparietales bilateral, asi como hipoperfusion asociada a dichas zonas. Con los resultados de la evaluacion neuropsicologica en correlacion con las dificultades en las actividades de la vida diaria, mas los estudios de neuroimagen, se puede apoyar el diagnostico de posible demencia tipo Alzheimer, descartando el de pseudo demencia por depresion.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the role of psychiatric disorders, biological factors, and genetic factors in suicidal behaviour. These increase risk and the susceptibility of some individuals to react more severely to stress but do not inevitably lead to suicide. All psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of suicide, particularly mood disorders, schizophrenia, and drug and alcohol misuse. Comorbidity (multiple psychiatric disorders at the same time or psychiatric and physical disorders together) is common. The vulnerability to suicidal behaviour is partly inherited. The serotonin and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal systems are associated with suicide; however biological factors lack specificity. There is an important interaction between genetic susceptibility and the environment—stressors may have more of an impact in individuals who carry particular genes.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Es gibt wenig gesicherte Erkenntnis zur Therapie “komorbider” Störungen plus bipolar affektiver Störungen. Auch ist die nosologische Einordnung der zusätzlichen Erkrankungen nicht unumstritten: Manche genetischen und Verlaufsuntersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass hinter dem gleichzeitigen Auftreten mehrerer psychischer Störungen eigenständige Krankheitsprozesse (im Sinne breiter Spektra oder “Formenkreise”) stehen könnten.",

      "abstract": "Female sexual functioning is a complex process involving physiological, psychosocial and interpersonal factors. Sexual dysfunction (SD) is frequent (40-74%) among women with multiple sclerosis (MS), reflecting neurological dysfunction, psychological factors, depression, side effects of medications and physical manifestations of the disease, such as fatigue and muscle weakness. A conceptual model for sexual problems in MS characterizes three levels. Primary SD includes impaired libido, lubrication, and orgasm. Secondary SD is composed of limiting sexual expressions due to physical manifestations. Tertiary SD results from psychological, emotional, social, and cultural aspects. Sexual problems cause distress and may affect the family bond. Practical suggestions on initiation of discussion of sexual issues for MS patients are included in this review. Assessment and treatment of sexual problems should combine medical and psychosexual approaches and begin early after MS diagnosis. Intervention can be done by recognizing sexual needs, educating and providing information, by letting patients express their difficulties and referring them to specialists and other information resources.",

The symptoms correspond closely to the details of that syndrome, which is often recorded as following operative interventions on the temporal lobe, and also in degenerative or inflammatory lesions of this area. In the traumatic apallic syndrome, the Kliiver-Bucy symptoms may be particularly marked and intense and may progress rapidly. However, in some patients the manifestations of the removal of sexual inhibitions appear only in an altered form as pleasure reactions. Occasionally the alterations of sexual behaviour may persist permanently. During the period of recovery the patients develop various stereotyped complex movements such as smoking or hand-kissing, homologous to move­ ments which occur in physiological human behaviour. There is a short discussion of the possible morphological correlations and of the pathophysiology.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

The prevalence of these disorders is 1-1.6% in the United States, and 1.5-3% around the world (Aghili, 2004). Most patients with bipolar spectrum disorders refer for treatment in a depressive episode and this reason proper diagnosis of the disease is often delayed for about ten years as it was found that given the type of disorder the average time for the treatment is about ten years (Hirschfeld, 2001). Such delays are often associated with undesirable results; patients do not receive appropriate treatment to relieve symptoms and may even receive treatments that exacerbate their symptoms so that they continue inappropriate behaviors which are destructive to themselves and their relatives (Hirschfeld, 2001).",

      "abstract": "The author is looking to the psychological consequences of chronic hair diseases through a review of the recent literature. In general those consequences are depending on the coping skills and on the personality traits. The effect of hair loss on the quality of life is similar to that of a severe psoriasis. The most important effect is a loss of self-confidence. This is enhanced by an insecure or ambivalent attachment pattern. The coping skills will therefore be different and less flexibles. Two psychiatric syndromes are first mentioned: the body dysmorphic syndrome (very slight or imaginary defect in appearance) and trichotillomania. Androgenetic alopecia leads to an important suffering in women mostly. Alopecia induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. This does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. A cosmeto-oncologic care strategy is developed in our department to improve the quality of life of the patients during this difficult coping period. Alopecia areata has an important psychiatric comorbidity: mostly anxiety and depression. Old stressful life events are frequently reported at the onset of the disease revealing a chronic stress. Those patients have difficulties to express their feelings (what is called alexithymia). With a systemic vision this is interpreted as an unconscious task of avoiding family conflicts. This conflicts are raising the anxiety of family splitting coming from early loss or death in the previous generations. A cautious family therapy helps to change those unconscious myths.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

      "title": "Personality development as predictor of psychological distress in patients of psychological suspected of lung cancer or esophageal cancer",
      "abstract": "textabstractCancer patients suffer from a variety of problems, somatically, socially and\npsychologically. Somatically, the illness and treatment threaten physical integrity.\nCancer is an insidious disease, in which the patient is severely ill before he\nnotices any symptoms. The (mostly) invasive treatment often results in the patient\nfeeling worse after treatment than before. This means that the confidence the\npatient has in his own body is diminished.\nSocially, the illness, treatment and its consequences (tiredness, lack of energy,\nfeeling ill) may result in social isolation. This can be increased by the fear and\nuncertainty of by-standers how to approach the patient, what to say to him, and\nwhat to expect from him.\nPsychologically, the patient has to cope with the emotional consequences of the\nillness, such as changes in life perspective, mourning his lost health, and anxiety\nand uncertainty about the future.\nThe literature on the prevalence of psychological distress in cancer patients is\nequivocal. The percentages of depressed and/or anxious patients reported in the\nliterature vary widely from 0% to 49% (cf. Bulman, 1992; Omne-Ponten,\nHolmberg, Burns, Adami & Bergstrom, 1992; Devlen, Maguire, Phillips, Crowther\n& Chambers, 1987). It is worthwhile to solve the lack of clarity on this point. This\nleads to the first research question of this thesis: what is the prevalence and\ncourse of psychological distress in cancer patients?",

In recent years, the treatment of sexual dysfunction has shifted from mostly psychosocial interventions, such as sex therapy, to the use of recently developed biochemical interventions, such as the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. However, the increased focus on the medical treatment of erectile problems has been accompanied by a neglect of the biopsychosocial factors that affect the couple. This clinical synthesis provides up-to-date information on evaluating individuals and couples and on empirically based treatments. Each of the sexual disorders will be discussed from the phenomenological, etiological, and therapeutic angles.",

We present the case of a 17-year-old female requiring psychiatric hospitalization for obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder with mixed affective features, who was subsequently diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment with potent immunosuppression resulted in remission of psychiatric illness. Due to a lack of awareness and/or the lack of specific biomarkers, clinicians may not associate psychiatric symptoms with autoimmune disease, including primary Sjogren's syndrome. This case demonstrates that Sjogren's syndrome may be a causative or aggravating factor in mental disorders and that autoimmune diseases should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness especially in cases of concurrent physical symptomatology and severity or treatment resistance of psychiatric disease.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairments in married people under the age of 60 are not common and have received little attention. Using a single case study and drawing on the author’s wide experience of counseling couples in this situation, this paper discusses some of the psychodynamic mechanisms that may come into play when multiple sclerosis (or any other neurological illness) threatens the cognitive capacities of one partner. Normal couple interactions, arising from attachment and affection and important for their maintenance, may be challenged. The author considers some of the problems associated with carers identifying with cognitively-deteriorating partners, including difficulties in thinking. Defenses against recognizing emotionally painful deficits contribute to frustration. Either partner’s lack of conscious awareness or acknowledgment of cognitive deficits and uncertainties as to the origin of troublesome behavior can also cause problems. Cognitive impairments impact on grieving and can give rise to a loss of an internal good object, as well as the loss of normal signals by which carers know they are loved. Also noted is the impact of cognitive problems on sexual relations and on relationships with children and with health professionals. The role of a counselor for a carer in this situation is discussed.",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

      "abstract": "Fifty clinically diagnosed cases of presenile dementia were reviewed retrospectively, noting recorded symptomatology and findings on mental status, neurological and ancillary examinations at the time of definitive diagnosis. Manifest symptoms were numerous and varied over time but not in any uniform fashion which would allow the identification of stages of illness. The most frequent symptom was change in personality or behavior (78 per cent of the sample) whereas the most consistent symptom longitudinally was impairment of memory (present in at least 50 per cent of patients over time). A significant association of patient age at the time of symptom onset and at first physician contact with the character of the presenting symptoms at these times was identified. When symptoms were characteristically psychiatric rather than neurological in nature, patients had significantly earlier onset and earlier physician contact. Formal mental status examinations were notable in their consistently high frequency of classical signs of organic brain syndrome. Manifestations of psychosis and of a catastrophic reaction were uncommon. Neurological examination was abnormal in 84 per cent of the sample, with the most frequent finding being the presence of one or more release reflexes. Pneumoencephalography or computerized cerebral axial tomography was abnormal in all cases, in part a function of selection criteria. Electroencephalography was abnormal in 69 per cent of 48 cases, showing diffuse slowing in all but two instances. A normal electroencephalogram was present significantly more often when cerebral atrophy was limited to the cortical surfaces than when ventricular dilatation was present. Release reflexes were found to be significantly more common among patients with an abnormal as opposed to a normal electroencephalogram. No significant correlations among pattern and degree of cerebral atrophy, findings on neurological examination, signs of organic brain syndrome, and patient age and sex were apparent. Interpretation and implications of the results are discussed. The variability of clinical findings among patients, as well as over time, makes the establishment of specific diagnostic criteria difficult and raises again the question of whether presenile dementia constitutes a distinct clinical entity in the absence of tissue diagnosis.",

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "abstract": "As síndromes neuropsiquiátricas em pacientes com lúpus eritematoso sistêmico (LES) são comuns e apresentam características diversas. Podem ser classificadas em manifestações difusas, como depressão e psicose; ou focais, como mielite transversa e acidente vascular cerebral (AVC). Dentre as 19 síndromes neuropsiquiátricas descritas pelo American College of Rheumathology (ACR), as mais frequentes entre pacientes adultos são: cefaleias (20-40%), disfunção cognitiva (DC) (10-20%), transtornos de humor (10-20%), crises convulsivas (7-10%), doença cerebrovascular (7-10%) e ansiedade (4-8%). Apesar das prevalências superiores às observadas na população geral, permanece a discussão se tais síndromes são consequências diretas da doença autoimune ou secundárias a seus efeitos e a seu tratamento. A ocorrência de eventos neuropsiquiátricos no LES está associada a pior prognóstico, diminuição da qualidade de vida, maiores taxas de abandono escolar e de desemprego. O perfil comportamental queixoso, emocionalmente dependente e disfuncional para aspectos práticos do cotidiano é frequente entre os pacientes com LES. Estudos mostram que mesmo indivíduos sem histórico de comprometimento neurológico apresentam alterações neuropsiquiátricas difusas como depressão e DC. Modelos animais e estudos com pacientes demonstraram mudanças estruturais e funcionais em determinadas regiões cerebrais como amígdala, corpo caloso e hipocampo, fundamentais para o processamento emocional e cognitivo. Outros estudos apontam alterações de fluxo sanguíneo cerebral e nas taxas de concentração de metabólicos referentes a lesão neuronal, revelando possíveis mecanismos de dano silenciosos. Este artigo visa a discutir os principais aspectos biopsicossociais relacionados com transtorno de humor, ansiedade e DC no LES, e apresentar evidências de diferentes técnicas utilizadas pela neuropsicologia para a abordagem dessas síndromes.",

Cases may go underdiagnosed, misdirected, or commonly treated inappropriately. Clinical studies have conclusively shown an obvious link between childhood trauma and the emergence of symptoms. Transient dissociative episodes are common and normative phenomena during childhood. We reported a case of an 8-year-old boy, who presented with a 5-day history of hallucinatory behavior. He was causing significant nuisances, sudden onset of shouting aggressively, and behavioral changes, associated with neuropsychiatric presentation such as repetitive irregular movement involving his head, neck, and upper limb. There was an asynchrony of symptoms exhibited which were unexplained by clinical semiology or patterns. He was screaming in fear, talking irrelevantly, and acting suspiciously. This was his first presentation to the hospital and no features to suggest organicity. There was no family history of mental illness. No substances, or alcohol and drug usage Serial investigation turned out to be normal and unremarkable. The episodes get frequent whenever parents or hospital staff give more attention toward him. He was given a low dose of antipsychotics, but no obvious rapid changes were observed afterward. Further exploration noted, his parents reported that the patient had been very worked up with past related trauma at school and constantly talking about it. He was afraid, distressed, and anxious as he felt something bad would happen to him. There were significant issues related to attachment figures in this boy, possibly the absent parenting style.

      "title": "Depression and Suicide",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Most youth occasionally experience the blues, feel sad, or become irritable. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.Depressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time. Lifetime prevalence rates by late adolescence range between 20% and 25%.Prior to puberty, there is about a 1:1 gender ratio for depressive disorders. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females to males, which continues throughout adulthood. A combination of hormonal and social changes during puberty may explain the differing rates of depression among males and females.Depression has a complex genetic and environmental basis. Adoption, twin, and family studies all point to the impact of genetic factors, which seem to establish a young person's biologic vulnerability for depression. The onset of a depressive episode, however, often is precipitated by difficult life events or stressful experiences such as a parental divorce, school change, or relationship breakup. Other environmental risk factors include maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect). The pathways to depression are complex and variable. Some depressive disorders are more biologic; others are more situational.The symptoms of MDD and DD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), include changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional domains (Tables 1 and 2).In 1996, the World Health Organization ranked depression among the most disabling of all diseases in the world, leading all other disorders in \"years lived with disabilities.\" The reasons for this are apparent when one considers the course of depressive illness. Approximately 70% of youth who have MDD experience another depressive episode within 5 years, and youth who have depressive disorders have a fourfold risk of an adult depressive disorder. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents who have MDD can be expected to have adult recurrences. Early onset and recurrences also have been described as a cause of treatment-resistant depression in later life, leading to multiple episodes that last longer, become more severe, and become more difficult to treat. These tend to be associated with more hospitalizations, job absenteeism, and impaired work performance.Depressive disorders in youth are associated with impaired functioning in several areas of daily living. These include strained family and peer relationships, school attendance difficulties, and academic performance problems. Affected youth often experience suicidal thoughts and are at increased risk for attempted and completed suicide.Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) often presents as depressive symptoms, which can make it difficult to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression. BD is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. The inflated self-esteem, excess energy, and poor judgment that characterize a manic phase often result in dangerous activity and substantial social problems. Rapid cycling and mixed symptom states occur in subtypes of BD. Approximately 20% to 40% of children who have MDD eventually develop BD. Some clues to the risk for developing a manic or hypomanic episode include psychosis, psychomotor retardation, or a family history of BD.Another potential diagnostic dilemma occurs when a child or adolescent is abusing alcohol or drugs. Youth are not always forthcoming about such abuse, which may be associated with declining school performance, withdrawal from usual social activities, sleep disturbance, and negative moods. Careful questioning of the youth and parent/guardian is necessary to identify a substance use disorder in youth presenting with depressive symptoms. It can be equally challenging to identify a depressive disorder in youth initially identified for services because of problems related to alcohol or substance abuse.Most children and adolescents who are depressed also have a history of some other psychiatric or alcohol/drug use disorder. For example, 25% to 75% of depressed youth have one or more anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder or social phobia. Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, are also common, and substance abuse or dependence characterizes a significant minority of youth who are depressed. A gender difference exists in patterns of comorbidity. Girls more commonly have comorbid anxiety conditions; boys are more likely to have comorbid conduct disorders or substance use disorders.Children and adolescents rarely seek professional treatment. Thus, parents, teachers, pediatricians, and others who have regular contact with youth play critical roles in recognizing youth who are depressed. Few youth use the word \"depressed\"; even fewer report to someone that they may be experiencing a clinical depression. Therefore, it is helpful to ask youth about experiences of feeling down, \"bad,\" miserable, bored, or irritated. Signs of clinical depression that often initially are visible to others include withdrawal from activities, decline in school performance, change in sleep patterns, and sadness or irritability.The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of two questions in screening for depression among adults: \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" The Task Force concluded that evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of routine screening of children and adolescents, but these two questions may help clinicians detect primary symptoms of depression. More comprehensive screening instruments and diagnostic tools or a referral to a mental health professional should be considered if indicated. The Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory (RADS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) are screening tools used in some school and mental health clinics.Clinical interviews are the cornerstone of a comprehensive assessment and should include, at a minimum, interviews with the youth as well as the parent or guardian. In addition to gathering a complete history of presenting problems (onset, chronicity, severity, prior history of symptoms, and treatment), a full psychiatric interview is conducted to obtain information about possible comorbid conditions. For example, it is critical to ascertain whether psychotic features, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems are present. Information also is gathered about the youth's medical, developmental, social, and educational histories as well as the family psychiatric history.Important sources of information may include school academic and attendance records; teacher reports; and appropriate biomedical, psychological, or other test findings. Standardized self-report questionnaires may permit youths to answer questions about current symptoms without directly verbalizing the extent of their emotional distress to an adult. This approach sometimes can facilitate honest reporting of the number and severity of depressive symptoms. If noted in a self-report questionnaire, critical items always should be followed up with direct inquiry by the clinician (eg, if a youth reports suicidal ideation).The initial goals of treatment are to ensure the youth's safety and develop an effective therapeutic alliance with the youth and parents. This alliance will facilitate ongoing communication and continuation of care. Consultation with teachers and other caregivers also is important. A focus on patient and family education and a collaborative approach to treatment planning can enhance the youth's adherence to treatment recommendations.Psychoeducation is a key component of the treatment. Beyond this, perspectives on the first line of treatment vary. The choice of whether to begin with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic interventions or a combination depends on depression severity and chronicity, prior history of depressive episodes, likelihood of adherence, previous response to treatment, patient and family motivation for treatment, and availability of resources. Because of the psychological, environmental, and social problems associated with depression and its treatment, pharmacotherapy usually is not sufficient as the sole treatment. Attention to parental mental health and family stress as well as to strategies for helping parents manage the youth's irritability, isolation, or other problems should be included in psychotherapeutic interventions. These systemic concerns affect treatment adherence and ultimate outcomes.Psychoeducation addresses the signs and symptoms of depression; the importance of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication; and common misconceptions about the illness, therapy, or medications. It also is helpful to address the impact that depression has on school, social, and family functioning and the ways in which parents and teachers may aid in recovery. Parent and family education may increase adherence and reduce self-blame. Education of parents can help them identify their own mood disorders and potential treatment needs as well. Education also can reduce blame for symptoms such as irritability and anhedonia that may affect others.Controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depressed youth. Both generally are time-limited therapies that involve collaboration or guided discovery between the therapist and adolescent. CBT focuses on self-understanding of negative mood states and on the identification and modification of negative, distorted thought patterns. It also emphasizes problem-solving skills, communication skills, and the development of more adaptive behavior patterns. IPT strives to improve the youth's interpersonal functioning by improving self-understanding, problem-solving, communication, and coping in the realm of relationships. It focuses on a chosen interpersonal problem such as grief, a difficult role transition, an interpersonal conflict or role dispute, social skill deficits, or issues in step-parent families. Although randomized, controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for psychodynamic therapy with depressed youth, this approach may be useful. Family therapy is an important supplement to any of these approaches if difficulties in family communication and support are identified. Goals of family therapy may include improving family affective communication, increasing adaptive behaviors, and changing both interpersonal and family functioning.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants of choice for youth who require pharmacotherapy (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998). The efficacy of the SSRI fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptom severity in children and adolescents has been demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine also has demonstrated efficacy compared with imipramine and placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Other antidepressant medications are not well studied. Dosing guidelines recommend starting with 10 mg fluoxetine and increasing to 20 mg. The maximum dose is 40 mg to 80 mg. When treating a child younger than 8 years of age, clinicians may want to start with 4 to 8 mg elixir of fluoxetine. However, the efficacy and safety data have been demonstrated only down to age 8 years. If there are problems with insomnia, appetite loss, or restlessness, paroxetine is a more sedating SSRI, and dosing guidelines are identical to those for fluoxetine. SSRIs should be discontinued if symptoms of mania appear. However, youth may benefit from treatment with an SSRI for an extended period before BD develops.An adequate trial of SSRIs is at least 4 to 6 weeks. If no or only minimal improvement is observed, a dose increase should be considered and medication continued for at least 4 to 6 additional weeks. If no improvement has been observed, alternative strategies should be considered, including a referral to a psychiatrist in cases of treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, if the pediatrician is not comfortable in the prescriber role, a psychiatric consultation or referral to a physician experienced in the use of medication is recommended. Frequent medication adjustments are ill-advised, and tapering of medications that have shorter half-lives (eg, paroxetine) is recommended. Obtaining serum levels rarely is necessary unless concerns arise about toxicity or compliance. Studies among adults suggest that the same doses used to treat MDD are efficacious for DD.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not considered a first-line treatment for children and adolescents who are depressed, but they may be helpful in treating youth who have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, and narcolepsy as well as for augmentation purposes.In contrast to TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs have a relatively safe adverse effects profile, are easily used (once daily), are suitable for long-term maintenance, and have a low lethality after overdose. Additional information on adverse effects, medication interactions, and the treatment of comorbid conditions is available in reviews of practice recommendations published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.ECT can be a useful adjunct for individuals whose depression is severe or life-threatening, who have not responded to other treatments, who cannot take antidepressant medications, and who may have psychotic depression. The decision to use ECT must be made carefully and usually requires the recommendation of more than one psychiatrist as well as a substantial discussion with the child's parent or guardian.Unless there are significant adverse effects, medication should be continued for 6 to 12 months if it is believed to help in the remission of depressive symptoms. The pharmacotherapy should be monitored monthly during this continuation phase. Psychotherapy is helpful during this phase to bolster coping skills and to address antecedents, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts that may have contributed to the onset of depression. Medication adherence also may be improved by psychotherapy.Once the patient's symptoms have remitted for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance phase of treatment may last from 1 year to indefinitely. The goals are to facilitate healthy development and to prevent relapse or recurrence. These may be accomplished through monthly or quarterly visits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the present episode, frequency of previous episodes, comorbid disorders, the patient's motivation, and contextual factors (eg, support systems, family stress, and psychopathology).The presence of comorbid conditions often predicts a poorer response to psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. These conditions, such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, often persist after remission of the depressive symptoms and require targeted treatments. Because of time, cost, or the incompatibility of treatments, addressing all conditions simultaneously may be impossible. Hence, the clinician often must prioritize treatment goals and the sequence of interventions.A depressive disorder may be \"treatment-resistant\" because of an inadequate dosage or duration of medication trial, inadequate duration or \"fit\" with a particular psychotherapy, poor treatment adherence, complicating comorbidity, undetected BD, chronic or severe life events, misdiagnosis, or mistreatment. Psychopharmacologic strategies to address treatment-resistant depression should be applied systematically in conjunction with family education and support and include optimization, switching, augmentation, or combination. Consultation with a psychiatrist always is advised with treatment-resistant cases.If BD is present or is a possibility, a mood-stabilizing agent (eg, lithium carbonate, valproate, or carbamazepine) may be warranted, especially because antidepressants may induce mania in youths at risk for BD. Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience modest antidepressant effects with mood stabilizers alone. Antidepressants may be useful adjuncts in such treatments. Psychotic depression may require a combination of antidepressants with antipsychotics or ECT. Neuroleptics should be tapered after psychotic symptoms remit due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be preferred. However, the long-term effects of these medications have not been studied in youth.Suicide is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents (National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, 2000). The suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 years is 11.1 per 100,000, which is much higher than the rate for youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years (0.8 per 100,000). The suicide rate for males in the 15- to 19-year age group is markedly higher than that for females (Table 3). Rates differ by racial and ethnic group. African-American youth have lower suicide rates than Caucasian youth, with the lowest adolescent suicide rate being that of African-American females. The highest suicide rate is that of Native American males.Although many youth who report suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide do not become suicide victims, these categories overlap substantially. For instance, having frequent thoughts of suicide is the best predictor of suicide attempts, and most youth who attempt suicide report a history of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, greater severity of reported suicidal thoughts increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt within the next year. Approximately 35% to 45% of adolescents who complete suicide have a positive history of suicide attempt. The prevalences of both self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are higher for adolescent females than for adolescent males (Table 3).Risk factors for completed suicide and suicidal behavior are similar in most respects. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the more specific relationship between availability of firearms and completed suicide. In this section, we review the primary risk factors for completed suicide (Table 4).A history of prior suicidal behavior is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior. Nonlethal suicidal gestures or self-inflicted harm, which sometimes are thought to be manipulative or attention-seeking, should not be taken lightly. Youth often can be poor judges of lethality, and what is believed to be a gesture actually may be accompanied by significant suicidal intent. It also may result in substantial physical harm or even suicide because of an error in knowledge or judgment (eg, potential lethality of acetaminophen overdose).Approximately 80% of youth who attempt suicide and 90% of youth suicide victims have histories of identifiable psychiatric or mental disorders. The most common types of psychopathology in these youth are depressive disorders, alcohol or substance abuse, conduct disorder or patterns of aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders. Increased suicide risk is associated with conditions that often are refractory to treatment or present management problems. These include BD, a chronic depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol or substance abuse, and psychotic presentations.Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides (Table 5). In fact, suicidal ideation and behavior are common and often unrelenting problems among youth who have depressive disorders. Eighty-five percent of depressed youth report significant suicidal ideation, and 32% of depressed youth report one or more suicide attempts prior to adulthood. Retrospective studies have found that about 50% of adolescent suicides involve the consumption of alcohol, which increases impulsivity, impaired judgment, and mood changes.Environmental or family stress, especially a history of neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, are considered significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Interpersonal conflict and loss (eg, fights, break-ups, deaths) also are risk factors. Additionally, hopelessness, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, and agitation are psychological characteristics associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Recent general population surveys indicate that approximately 42% of these youth experience suicidal ideation, and 28% have made one or more suicide attempts during the past year. Many of the risk factors in these youth are the same as those for heterosexual youth. Problems such as comorbid substance abuse and depression, however, are more common among youth who have a homosexual orientation. In addition, risk factors such as stigmatization and discrimination are specific to those who face negative attitudes within society.The risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide increases when a youth knows someone who commits suicide. In these situations, intervention aimed at promoting grief and mourning and decreasing guilt, trauma, and social isolation as well as providing psychoeducational counseling aimed at decreasing identification with the suicidal behavior are recommended. Media coverage of suicide may spark suicide contagion. Clinicians are encouraged to advise reporters whenever possible to reduce excessive coverage and to advise parents and educators to discourage exposure of youth to such coverage.Firearms are found more commonly in the homes of suicide victims than in the homes of other youth, including those of psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal youth. The importance of restricting suicidal youth's access to firearms is highlighted by documented associations between more restrictive gun control laws and decreases in suicide rates. Similarly, potentially lethal drugs (such as prescription or over-the-counter sedative drugs) either should be removed from the homes of potentially suicidal youth or monitored closely by parents and guardians.Evidence suggests that if asked directly, adolescents will reveal suicidal preoccupations and previous suicidal behavior. Direct questions should address whether children or adolescents wish they were not alive, if they ever have thought about or tried to hurt themselves intentionally, if they ever have thought about or tried to kill themselves, and if they have or had such a plan in mind. It is important to understand that asking an adolescent about suicidal thoughts or behaviors will not \"put such ideas into his or her head\" or increase the risk for suicidal behavior. Follow-up inquiry regarding the intensity, chronicity, specificity, and recency of such thoughts is advised. Standardized self-report questionnaires, such as the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, may permit the youth to answer without direct verbalization, which can facilitate honesty. If endorsed, critical items related to intent or planning and items suggesting significant suicidality (in terms of chronicity, severity, or frequency) always should be followed up with direct inquiry. Other sources of information include reports from parents, teachers, or others who may have heard suicidal statements or witnessed behaviors such as giving away prized possessions. As with the assessment of depressive disorders, a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates input from the youth and parent or guardian is essential.A psychiatric inpatient or partial hospitalization program may be necessary for patients found to be at elevated suicide risk. Hospital stays generally are brief and emphasize safety, stabilization, evaluation, and aftercare recommendations. Suicide attempts (or plans) that have significant lethality and that include efforts taken to avoid detection indicate serious intent as well as knowledge and planning and should be taken extremely seriously. Furthermore, attention to safety requires consideration of the child's home environment. Parents and caregivers should be advised to remove lethal agents, especially firearms and toxic medications, from the home. Self-injurious behaviors by young children should not be disregarded as accidental. For example, when a 6-year-old child ingests poisonous materials, it may not be accidental. Such behavior should be assessed carefully for associated mood or other disturbance.Verbal or written \"no suicide\" contracts are used in many settings. The patient is asked to agree not to attempt suicide. Furthermore, the patient is asked to agree to contact the clinician, parent, or other responsible adult if he or she feels a suicidal urge or experiences suicidal intent. Perspectives on these contracts have evolved over the past decade, with an increasing emphasis on using the contract as an assessment tool. The contract process may reveal current suicidal intent. It also provides information about the patient's ability to identify, and willingness to turn to, helpful adults. It is useful to review what positive coping steps the youth and parent would take in the event of a suicidal crisis. This offers an opportunity for problem-solving and can counter the tendency of some youth and families to minimize or deny the risk of suicidal behavior. It should be noted, however, that research does not support the conclusion that such contracts prevent suicide; they are not substitutes for comprehensive case management.When caring for a potentially suicidal youth, suicide risk factors, including suicidal thoughts, urges, and behaviors, are monitored at each session. Rules of thumb when working with suicidal youth include: 1) confirming next appointment times at each session, 2) following up on \"no-shows,\" and 3) providing information to the youth and parent or guardian about easily accessible 24-hour emergency services. Comprehensive case management includes psychoeducation and regular patient monitoring with guidelines for responding to crises/changes in functioning.The population of suicidal youth is heterogeneous in terms of primary psychiatric disorder(s), comorbid conditions, personality traits, the presence of complicating psychosocial issues, developmental level, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of psychopathology and, more generally, suicide risk and protective factors.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Mental Deterioration in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: A variety of factors could potentially influence the occurrence of mental deterioration in epilepsy, including seizure type, age of seizure onset, seizure duration, and seizure severity. The available literature suggests that measures of severity are more predictive of progressive decreases in intellectual functioning. There is also evidence suggesting that seizure severity and cognitive deterioration might both be the result of underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities in some cases. In the majority of patients with epilepsy, however, with relatively less severe disease, there is little evidence for cognitive deterioration. Total seizure number also has an inverse correlation with level of psychosocial functioning in some studies, whereas others have found that patients with emotional difficulties have fewer seizures. In the case of emotional deterioration, the impact of interpersonal relationships and other environmental factors upon psychosocial outcome seems clear, and the evidence for specific pathophysiologic explanations for emotional deterioration, less convincing.",

      "title": "Multi-factorial Approaches to Substance Use Disorders and Addiction",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT One cannot get through a day (certainly not in the United States) without hearing about the devastation that substance abuse, addiction, and, in many cases, co-occurring disorders (ie, substance abuse or addiction in conjunction with a major psychiatric clinical syndrome and/or personality disorder) cast upon countless numbers of lives. For years, there has been a controversy as to whether addiction was simply a moral failing or a brain disease. Obviously, the latter is true. As with any disease, addiction and co-occurring disorders are frequently considered to be primary, progressive, chronic, and, if untreated, fatal. With the advent of more sophisticated neurobiological and multivariate research, we can get beyond trivializing this serious disease entity by labeling it as a weakness or character defect, and get on with the significant work of focusing on those neurological pathways and their etiology that are responsible for addictive patterns of behavior.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Oral-Facial Manifestations Caused by the Use of Psychotropic Medication in Psychiatric Patients",
      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

      "title": "Alcohol use, Abuse, Depression and Anxiety : The Clinical Links",
      "abstract": "Alcohol dependence, anxiety disorders and major depression commonly occur together; however, few stud- ies have assessed prospectively the magnitude of the risk that one disorder imparts on the subsequent oc- currence of the other. The following articles looks at certain important clinical factors in this association while trying to point out the reasons for the linkage between these disorders and how their treatments and management are interdependent. It also looks at comorbidity studies and outcome factors based on management. INTRODUCTION The recent large-scale epidemiologic study of psychopathol- ogy in the United States indicates that, while nearly half of the population will experience a major psychiatric illness at some point over their lifetime, the majority of these individu- als will also meet diagnostic criteria for at least one addi- tional disorder. In addition to its high frequency, psychiatric comorbidity has been shown to have important implications for patient functioning and prognosis. Comorbid conditions typically follow a more chronic and severe course than single disorders, and they are less amenable to treatment. Individu- als with two or more diagnoses are also significantly more likely to experience severe impairment in important life do- mains such as social and occupational functioning. For these reasons, it is not surprising that comorbidity has been re- ferred to as one of the most important challenges in the field of mental health. Understanding the nature of these relation- ships may have important implications for improving nosol- ogy, as well as for developing better models of prevention and treatment. Although many psychiatric disorders co-occur with great frequency, few conditions have been more widely or consistently implicated in comorbid relationships than alcoholism. Alcoholism is perhaps most strongly associated with antisocial personality disorder and drug abuse, but its relationship to other forms of psychopathology has become increasingly evident. In particular, investigations of patient samples indicate a strong co-occurrence of alcoholism with diverse forms of anxiety and depressive disorders. Results from community surveys and epidemiologic samples indicate that substantial comorbidity also exists for these disorders in the general population. These latter findings are particu- larly meaningful considering that alcoholism, anxiety, and depressive disorders are also the most common psychiatric syndromes in community surveys. The high co-occurrence of these syndromes, therefore, represents a significant clinical and public health issue that is likely to affect a substantial proportion of the general population.",

Deux grands types de plainte peuvent être opposés. La plainte suspecte de révéler une ma traduit un trouble de la mémorisation : les difficultés ne portent que sur le passé récent, elles retentissent rapidement sur la vie quotidienne et s’accompagnent de modifications du comportement qui amènent l’entourage à demander la consultation. Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage. Cette plainte, essentiellement corrélée à des phénomènes psychoaffectifs dominés par l’anxiété, une baisse de l’estime de soi et un trouble de l’identité ne constitue pas un risque particulier d’évolution vers la démence.",

      "title": "GENDER DIFFERENCES IN COPING AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS",
      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common arthritic disease, occurs as part of the normal aging process. Common symptoms of OA include pain, tenderness, stiffness, loss of flexibility, and reduced mobility. Additionally, people with OA experience higher incidences of depressive symptoms, mood disturbance, and lower health status than the general population. Women have OA more often than men, and there are known gender differences in the way in which men and women experience OA pain. Women have lower thresholds for pain and rate the same stimuli as more painful than men. The relationships among depression, mood disturbance, and pain may be different for women than for men. People with OA experience psychological distress, impairment in physical functioning, physical disability, and therefore lower levels of health status than the general population, and this disability may be more prominent for women. Findings regarding gender differences in coping with OA pain have been inconsistent. Self-efficacy, or a person's belief that he or she can succeed in certain situations, is related to the type of coping an individual uses. There is evidence of gender differences in self-efficacy; however, no studies have examined whether these differences exist in older adults with OA. This thesis was designed to determine whether self-efficacy and coping mediate the relationship between OA and physical and psychological outcomes, and to determine whether the relationships among these variables differ as a function of gender. Additionally, the impact of perceived control as a moderator of coping was examined. It was hypothesized that 1) Participants with higher self-efficacy would engage in more problem-focused and less emotion-focused coping than individuals with lower self-efficacy. In turn, individuals who engaged in more problem-solving and meaning-focused coping and less emotion-focused coping would have higher levels of health status and lower levels of depression than those who engaged in less problem-focused coping and meaning-focused coping and more emotion-focused coping styles, 2) Individuals with high levels of perceived control would engage in more problem-focused coping and less emotion-focused coping than those with low levels of perceived control. Individuals with low levels of perceived control would engage in more emotion-focused coping and less problem-focused coping and 3) The hypothesized relationships would differ between males and females. Participants included 363 Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) members (233 women and 130 men) from a larger intervention study involving social support, education, or a combination of both. Coping was measured using the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC). Self-efficacy was measured using Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale. Control was measured using the helplessness subscale from the Arthritis Helplessness Index (AHI). Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Mood disturbance was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS).…",

Depression, confusion, and thought disorders are frequently associated with the critical symptomatology, and they may suggest other psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia, mood disorder, conversion disorder) or a substance abuse. A diencephalic-hypothalamic dysfunction is suspected, even if this composite symptomatology cannot easily be linked to a simple mechanism. The aim of this article is to illustrate problems in differential diagnosis, using a case approach. History, course, and therapeutic intervention in a 21-year-old patient with KLS, associated with a clear psychiatric symptomatology and a critical affective pattern, is reported. Psychiatric correlates of KLS are discussed, including the relationship with affective disorders and the possible emotional impact of the attacks. Implications regarding a combined psychological and pharmacological treatment are also discussed.",

While the disorder as seen in the clinic is much less common in males than females this may not be a true reflection of the differential sex or overall prevalence rates.

As in the female the mechanism appears to develop out of normal adolescent dieting behaviour and to arise as a means of avoiding overwhelming psychosocial maturational demands of adolescence. Premorbid and family features include a state of overnutrition and a high degree of family psychopathology reflected in high rates of parental psychiatric morbidity and marital difficulty.",

      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hintergrund:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Die stressinduzierte Aktivierung des sympathischen Nervensystems löst eine Kaskade metabolischer Reaktionen aus. Emotionaler Stress ist eine spezielle Form von Stress, bei der der Stressor eine psychische Reaktion auf eine Situation ist, die subjektiv als traumatisch empfunden wird. Stresshormone können vielfältige Wirkungen auf den Körper haben; allerdings ist weiterhin unklar, ob und wie sie sich auf die Physiologie der Augen auswirken. Die vorliegende Arbeit berichtet über einen Fall von schwerer okulärer Hypertension, bei dem emotionaler Stress als einzige Ursache ermittelt wurde, und untersucht mögliche aggravierende Faktoren. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fallbericht:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Bei der Patientin handelte es sich um eine 78-jährige Frau vom Persönlichkeitstyp A mit anamnestisch bekanntem pseudoexfoliativen Glaukom, die sich mit einem akuten asymmetrischen Anstieg des Augeninnendrucks (IOD) unmittelbar nach einem familiären Zerwürfnis vorstellte. Zuvor war ihr IOD nach einer tiefen Sklerektomie im rechten Auge und einem Ex-PRESS-Shunt im linken Auge stabil gewesen. Die restliche körperliche Untersuchung war vollständig unauffällig, und die optische Kohärenztomographie des vorderen Augensegments zeigte ein durchgängiges diffuses Sickerkissen. Innerhalb von 24 Stunden war parallel zum Rückgang des Stresslevels eine Beinahe-Normalisierung des IODs zu beobachten. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schlussfolgerungen:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Der vorliegende Fallbericht spricht dafür, dass akuter emotionaler Stress den IOD bei Patienten mit Glaukom stark beeinflussen kann. Dies könnte bei der Versorgung von Glaukompatienten von Bedeutung sein und deutet darauf hin, dass in Glaukomstudien der Persönlichkeitstyp sowie der emotionale und soziale Kontext als weitere Faktoren berücksichtigt werden müssen. Diese Beobachtungen basieren auf einem Einzelfallbericht und müssten in einer größeren Untersuchung bestätigt werden.",

      "abstract": "What is the evolution of hysteria, now that the spectacular crises of previous times tend to occur less frequently? Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Ces comportements persistent souvent pendant des annees, et sont nettement plus frequents et plus severes qu’ils ne le sont chez la plupart des enfants du meme âge. De plus, ces comportements presentent des difficultes majeures pour l’entourage. Ils perturbent parfois gravement la vie de famille et, a l’ecole, la vie de classe, entravant ainsi le developpement du fonctionnement adaptatif dans son ensemble. Pour finir, le DSM-IV definit trois sous-types de l’ADHD qui refletent la nature des symptomes les plus evidents ainsi dans le deficit de l’attention/hyperactivite, type inattention predominante, l’enfant presente six symptomes d’inattention ou plus, mais moins de six symptomes d’hyperactivite et d’impulsivite ; dans le deficit de l’attention/hyperactivite, type hyperactivite-impulsivite predominante, l’inverse s’applique : l’enfant presente six symptomes d’hyperactivite et d’impulsivite ou plus, mais moins de six symptomes d’inattention ; dans le deficit de l’attention/hyperactivite, type mixte, l’enfant presente a la fois six symptomes ou plus d’inattention et six symptomes ou plus d’hyperactivite et d’impulsivite.",

Los diagnosticos mas frecuentes en clinicas especializadas son en primer lugar la enfermedad de Alzheimer, y en segundo lugar la demencia vascular o la demencia frontotemporal segun las series. Las demencias en el adulto joven se diferencian de las demencias en los adultos mayores por una serie de aspectos clinicos y asistenciales especificos. Por ejemplo, con debuts con formas clinicas inusuales o diferentes de las de la misma enfermedad en personas mayores, y con una mayor frecuencia de trastornos no-cognitivos que puede llegar hasta el 80% de los casos. Por desgracia, estas demencias tienden a diagnosticarse mas tarde que las demencias de inicio tardio. Este retraso diagnostico se ve facilitado por la falta generalizada de servicios especializados, y por la falta de concienciacion en la comunidad medica y en la sociedad en general acerca de estas enfermedades, lo cual contribuye tambien a un mayor estres en familiares y cuidadores EnglishYoung-onset dementias begin before the age of 65 years and from an epidemiological point of view are less frequent than those dementias with an onset in later life. The most frequent diagnoses in specialist clinics are Alzheimer’s disease in the first instance followed by vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia depending on the series. Young-onset dementias differ from those in older adults in a variety of specific clinical and service provision aspects. For example, with unusual or different presentations from those of the same illness in older adults, and because of a greater frequency of non-cognitive disorders that can reach up to 80% of cases. Unfortunately, these dementias tend to be diagnosed later compared to those in older adults. This diagnostic delay is possible due to the lack of specialist services and the of awareness in the medical community and society at large regarding these conditions, something that also contributes to the raised burden of care in families and carers.",

Lobar lesions or trauma, seizure activity, cerebellar dysfunction, and drugs have been implicated as well.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Muscle cramp is characterized by involuntary, painful, visible contraction of a muscle (or a part of muscle) and is always associated with irregular repetitive firing of motor unit action potentials (200 à 300 Hz) which is caused by hyperexcitability of intramuscular terminal motor axons. It's a common condition in normal people, but most commonly in young people (pregnancy, exercise) and more in the elderly (50% after 65 years-old). A careful history and examination should allow the physician to determine the significance of cramp. ENMG and biological tests are needed in cases of severe symptoms (severity and frequency of cramps) and/or abnormal examination. Idiopathic and secondary (drug or metabolic disorders) cramps are the most common groups, but it's very important to search the motor unit diseases (neuropathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuromyotonia, and a cramp fasciculation syndrome which can preceded ALS). The first goal in management of cramp is to determine if there is an underlying cause and the second to use physical measures (stretching), because, pharmacologic treatments have a moderate interest because of the potential of toxicity (quinine sulfate) or a little effectiveness (vitamin B complex, naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem, gabapentin). Isolated cramp doesn't need treatment.",

Weakness usually starts with the legs, with proximal distribution and minimal sensory loss. However occasionally weakness begin in upper limbs and or cranial nerves, distribution.

Although the human brain has a considerable potential for plasticity, any breakdown in this plasticity may be key to pathogenesis for Alzheimer’s or neurovascular disease. Five to ten percent of the population aged 65 and older show dementia, as does approximately fifty percent of people over 85. For highly accomplished individuals, the first sign of cognitive deterioration is an increase in the time and effort needed to carry out a task. The diagnosis of dementia is based on: 1) a history of persistent and progressive decline; 2) cognitive scores in one or more tests that fall beyond 2 SD’s from age and education-matched ranges; 3) change in scores that exceed 1 SD within a 6-12 month test/retest period; 4) scores below 36 in the Mini-mental State Exam are considered abnormal; 5) patients should be retesting in 12-18 months.

This study reviewed the literature on RBD with regard to potentially lethal behavior. A total of 39-41 clinical cases of RBD associated with potentially lethal behaviors to self and/or others were found, involving a child and adults of all age groups, that manifested as choking/headlock (n = 22-24), defenestration/near-defenestration (n = 7), and diving from bed (n = 10). A total of 80.8% (n = 21) were males; 19.2% (n = 5) were females; mean age was 65.6 +/- (SD) 13.8 years (range: 27-81 years, and a child). (Gender/age data were not listed in the remaining cases.) An etiologic association of RBD with a neurologic disorder (or with pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders, n = 4) was present in 21-23 patients. Thus, RBD carries well-documented, potential forensic consequences during RBD episodes that could possibly have been misinterpreted as suicidal or homicidal behavior.",

This approach should assume the form and content of an expert specialist opinion, that is, of a legal medical expertise and should rely on a more extensive medical and non-medical documentation than the one serving for therapeutic purposes. As such methodological approach is rarely met in practice, we have proposed a model that includes evaluation of cumulative exposure to asbestos dust, determination of work and vital disability, and evaluation of mental pain. This method stems from our long-time practice and experience with patients suffering from asbestos-related diseases, including the experience acquired since 2002 from cooperation with the Reference Centre for Asbestosis and Other Asbestos-Related Diseases of the Croatian Ministry of Health at the Department for Pulmonary Diseases of the Clinical Hospital Split.",

Timing of decompression have been stratified into four categories: (1) immediate decompression for those compartmental syndromes whose missed therapy would rapidly lead to patient death or extreme disability, (2) early decompression with the time burden of 3–12 h and in any case before clinical signs of irreversible deterioration, (3) delayed decompression identified with decompression performed after 12 h or after signs of clinical deterioration has occurred, and (4) prophylactic decompression in those situations where high incidence of compartment syndrome is expected after a specific causative event.",

Serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation occurs in over 90% of cases. Many diagnostic criteria sets for neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been proposed, all of which include hyperthermia and muscle rigidity as major symptoms, and serum CK elevation as either a major or minor symptom. In general, elevated CK occurs in the initial stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and corresponds temporally with the onset of muscle rigidity. However, in some exceptional cases, CK elevation and emergence of muscle rigidity do not appear in the same stage, making early diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome more difficult. Two rare cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are presented in which elevated serum CK and emergence of muscle rigidity did not occur in the same stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. An elevated CK level is common in the early stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, suggesting that serum CK elevation is a useful indicator for early detection of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, a definitive diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be determined from the presence of specific clinical symptoms.",

De aparicion sutil, insidiosa, socavan al afectado si no se tiene precaucion, comunicacion y tratamiento. Ya Tolstoi, escribia como los humanos estaban preparados para todo menos para los problemas de alcoba; sufriendose en secreto. En ello la medicina ha relegado a la sexologia con el correspondiente detrimento Ahora se solventa en todas las ramas de la Psiquiatria, un mundo donde cabe la sexologia medica, pero pueden existir etiologias con sintomas similares. Sin menosprecio de la disminucion de la libido en la depresion y multiples patologias psiquiatricas, las disfunciones sexuales tambien pueden dar sintomatologia psiquiatrica afectante y generadora de depresion, con origenes distintos y sintomatologias paralelas. Un paciente con inquietudes o temores en su sexualidad NO esta para alegrias sociosexuales, pues dicha patologia sexual le mina deseo y pensamientos. Las depresiones sexuales se sufren y mantienen con el “sintoma del leon herido” * ; a pesar de estar hoy la medicina preparada para recibir, entender, atender, diagnosticar, tratar y prescribir medicacion y tratamiento psicoterapeutico. * Concepto acunado por el autor, que define como la mujer y especialmente el hombre, por su mal entendido orgullo sexual, prefiere sufrir las consecuencias de patologias como disfuncion erectil, eyaculacion precoz o anorgasmia femenina, antes que ser tachado como impotente o frigida, en vez de acudir a un medico especialista para su diagnostico y tratamiento.

      "title": "Prevalence of Diminished Libido and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder",
      "abstract": "Low sexual desire (LSD) is a rather common sexological symptom, which occurs in 33.4% of women, taking the first place among other such symptoms, and in 15.8% of men. At the same time, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is detected much less often due to the fact that one of its diagnostic criteria consists in distress caused by LSD. Although LSD becomes more frequent with age, distress reduces with age. Therefore the prevalence of HSDD among women remains a constant. In the author’s opinion, the approach that excludes a high rank of subjectivism in the diagnostic assessment of LSD (if a person has LSD but the latter does not cause any distress in this case or even, maybe, is fine with him/her, this person is healthy; if distress is caused the person is ill) is constructive. It is pointed out that both the rate of LSD and the prevalence of HSDD vary depending upon the age, race/ethnicity, educational level, body mass index, current smoking status, current depression, taking of antidepressants by people with a previous diagnosis of depression, hormonal therapy (in women during menopause), menopausal status and country of residence. It is reported that men are more biological in their sexual manifestations versus women, in whom psychological factors play a more marked role versus men. The latter think about sex and fantasize about it more frequently than women; they want to have sex more often irrespective of their sexual orientation; they want to have a larger number of sex partners; they masturbate more frequently; they are less inclined to give up their sexual activity; their sexual desire appears at an earlier age; they use a wide variety of sexual practices, and the role of biology is reduced by social factors in women to a greater extent than in men. Data are given that indisputably indicate a larger sexual activity of men versus women. For example, it has been revealed that lesbian couples have sexual relations significantly less frequently than heterosexual and gay couples. The same study has shown that the worse the state of health and the greater the extent of misfortune, the larger the lack of sexual interest. “everyday alcohol intake”, “bad or satisfactory state of health” and “emotional problems or stress” have proved to be predictors (prognostic factors) of LSD in men. Also, data of other studies on the prevalence of LSD in men as well as information about the rate of HSDD in them are given. It is pointed out that noticeable differences exist in the levels of LSD prevalence in different cultures in the range of 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from Southeastern Asia at the age of 40-80 years. The feeling of guilt caused by sex can mediate this association between the Southeastern ethnicity and sexual desire in men.",

It disproportionately affects women and occurs in one in five pregnant women. RLS can be idiopathic or secondary, when it occurs with iron deficiency, renal failure, medications, and neurological or rheumatological disease. Periodic limb movements are frequent but not specific to RLS. Identifying the frequency of symptoms can guide management. Treatment is with iron supplementation if deficient and with low-dose dopamine agonists or gabapentin used as first-line medications. Augmentation can occur with long-term treatment with dopamine agonists. Treatment during pregnancy differs from routine guidelines due to the risk of teratogenicity.",

Individuals experience uncomfortable sensations of the extremities, which occur with inactivity and are relieved with activity. Because of the circadian rhythmicity of these symptoms, RLS symptoms can interfere with sleep onset. Symptom descriptors are varied; some commonly used terms are \"creepy-crawly,\" \"uncomfortable,\" \"pins and needles,\" and \"internal itch.\" Regardless of the descriptor, symptoms of RLS include a compelling urge to move, as they are usually improved with movement, and patients frequently resort to flexing, stretching, and vigorous movement. The end result is typically poor quality of sleep, leading to excessive daytime somnolence and feelings of fatigue. Althugh the disorder affects both genders, it is more common in women (in most populations studied) and is associated with several medical conditions including uremia, anemia, diabetes, pregnancy, and menopause.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë.

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

To establish an accurate composite diagnosis, the urologist must be familiar with the many emotional and organic factors influencing sexual function. Research being carried on at various centers involves efforts toward better differentiation, or linkage, of psychogenic and organic impotence. The author has previously reported acceptable rates of successful therapy of psychogenic impotency in men. The technique consists essentially of attentive listening and emotional support. Treatment usually can be accomplished within three sessions at weekly intervals–a much shorter time than that involved in other current methods. Psychogenic impotency may be treated primarily by the urologist, or he may refer the patient to an appropriate consultant. Not all patients require or will respond to the same therapeutic approach.",

The severe and predominantly psychological form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact aetiology of PMS is not known. PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced sensitivity to this progesterone. The increased sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter (mainly serotonin) dysfunction. The key diagnostic feature is that the symptoms must be absent in the time between the end of menstruation and ovulation. Prospective symptom rating charts are used for this purpose. Treatment is achieved by suppression of ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. In this chapter, the authors describe the aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis and evidence-based management of premenstrual syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Data regarding the increased incidence of psychiatric illness during midlife in women are still conflicting. However, there is a growing consensus that certain groups of women may in fact be at higher risk for mood symptoms and psychiatric disorders during the perimenopausal transition. Mood symptoms during the perimenopause may be related to mood disorders during other periods of hormonal fluctuation throughout a woman's reproductive lifecycle. Elucidating these associations may advance the understanding of mood disorders during the perimenopausal transition. The epidemiology and treatment of perimenopausal mood symptoms compared with the epidemiology and treatment of mood disorders during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and postpartum. Common risk factors associated with mood disorders during these periods of hormonal changes or instability include poor lifestyle habits, a history of hormonally related mood disorders, stress and negative life events, ethnicity, and comorbidity. Reproductive-related mood disorders also are subject to an improvement in symptoms in response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As the morbidity associated with mood disorders during midlife may be quite significant, and as life expectancy continues to increase, recognition, prevention, and treatment of perimenopausal affective illness is becoming increasingly essential.",

      "abstract": "Zunaechst wird im vorliegenden Abschnitt eine Uebersicht gegeben ueber grundsaetzliche und typische psychophysische Leistungsminderungen und Ausfallserscheinungen unter Alkoholeinfluss, wie sie ab 0,3 Promille moeglich und ab 0,5 bis 0,8 Promille regelhaft in inter- und intraindividuell unterschiedlicher Auspraegung zu beobachten sind. Psychische Wirkungen sind unter anderem eine allgemeine Enthemmung, eine erhoehte Reizbarkeit bis zur Aggressivitaet und eine Einschraenkung des Kritikvermoegens. Physische Wirkungen betreffen das Sehvermoegen, das Hoervermoegen, die Reaktion und das Kleinhirn, was sich in Gleichgewichts- und Bewegungsstoerungen aeussert. Alkoholwirkungen sind in hohem Masse von der Alkoholgewoehnung und der Gesamtbefindlichkeit abhaengig. Generell wirkt Ethanol auf das Zentralnervensystem daempfend. Unter Alkoholeinfluss sind gehaeuft Fahrfehler wie Schlangenlinienfahren, Geradeausfahren in Kurven, Auffahren auf stehende Fahrzeuge oder Hindernisse und inadaequate und Fehlreaktionen auf ueberraschende und komplexere Verkehrssituationen zu beobachten. Alkoholische Rauschzustaende koennen als einfacher, atypischer und pathologischer Rausch klassifiziert werden. Die juristische Wuerdigung im Hinblick auf Vorsatz oder Fahrlaessigkeit bei Trunkenheitsdelikten bedarf gegebenenfalls sachverstaendiger Beurteilung unter Einbeziehung alkoholspezifischer und psychopathologischer Kriterien. Die Hoehe einer Blutalkoholkonzentration (BAK) ist aus rechtsmedizinischer Sicht nicht per se entscheidend. Insgesamt soll beurteilt werden, ob zur Tatzeit eine relevante psychische Beeintraechtigung durch Alkohol vorgelegen ist. Die Beurteilung der Schuldfaehigkeit erfordert eine Gesamtschau aller relevanten Faktoren und Phaenomene im Hinblick auf die Intensitaet des Rauschzustandes unter Beruecksichtung vor allem der vorgeworfenen Tat und der zu unterstellenden Hemmschwelle.

The RGS has been sometimes reported in Parkinson disease. In patients without Parkinson disease, RGS is also known as persistent genital arousal disorder (PSAS), which includes uncontrollable genital arousal, with or without orgasm or genital engorgement, unrelated to sexual desire. Although withdrawal from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants is reported to induce PSAS, there is no report of RGS or PSAS induced by antidepressants. Methods We obtained the consent for the presentation and have not identified individuals for ethical reasons. Results We first report a woman patient with depression induced RGS by milnacipran (MLN). Conclusions We discuss the relationship with restless legs syndrome and the difference from akathisia. It is highly possible MLN affected her RGS because she experienced RGS for the first time after the dose of MLN was increased. A limitation of this report is that we stopped MLN and administered gabapentin enacarbil immediately. We should join MLN to the list of compounds suspected of inducing RGS.",

Recently, some authors have supported that organic abnormalities in the olfactory sensors and a hyperactive limbic system, combined with peculiar personality traits, can best explain MCS. Epidemiological observations suggest that MCS has a 2-3% prevalence in the general population and that women are more significantly at risk to develop the disturbance; about 80% of affected patients are in fact women between the ages of 30 and 50. On closer inspection, many women present with hyperosmia during two other common female conditions, i.e. pregnancy and menstrual migraine, both accompanied by well known neurovegetative limbic symptoms; therefore, it appears reasonable to include a hormonal imbalance in the pathogenesis of MCS.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children.

      "title": "Entstehung, Diagnose und Früherkennung schizophrener Erkrankungen",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenien treten weltweit mit einer Lebenszeitprävalenz von etwa 1 % auf. Wieso ist eine teilweise erblich bedingte und oft schwer verlaufende Erkrankung so weit verbreitet und tritt relativ häufig auf? Eine mögliche Erklärung besagt, dass es neben den Krankheitssymptomen auch Auswirkungen der Disposition oder der Erkrankung selbst gibt, die sich - zumindest bei Familienangehörigen oder nur leicht Erkrankten - positiv auswirken. Ein möglicher Grund ist das Fehlen der latenten Inhibition bisher unwichtiger Reize bei schizophrenen Patienten: Wird in einer Versuchsanordnung eine Vielzahl von Reizen präsentiert, von denen aber nur ein einziger als Hinweisreiz fungiert, auf den reagiert werden muss, um eine Belohnung zu erzielen, filtern Gesunde die unwichtigen Reize schnell aus. Wechselt aber unangekündigt die Versuchsanordnung und ein bisher unwichtiger Reiz ist nun der Hinweisreiz, dann brauchen Gesunde meist recht lange, um den Reiz zu entdecken. Von latenter Inhibition wird gesprochen, weil Gesunde sehr viel länger brauchen, den Reiz zu entdecken, wenn er bereits vorhanden, aber bisher unwichtig war, als wenn er neu in der Situation auftritt. Die bisherige Bedeutungslosigkeit des Reizes „hemmt” also seine Wahrnehmung als Hinweisreiz. Anders ist dies bei schizophrenen Patienten: Sie hemmen die Wahrnehmung des bisher unwichtigen Reizes offenbar weniger effektiv, so dass sie ihn schneller erkennen können, wenn er beim Wechsel der Versuchsbedingungen zum Hinweisreiz wird. Zwar brauchen sie insgesamt oft deutlich länger als Gesunde, um die Versuchsanordnung zu bewältigen, gemessen an ihrer üblichen Reaktionszeit gelingt ihnen der Wechsel auf die neue Reizkonstellation aber schneller als den Gesunden [2]. Schizophrene Menschen können also in unüblichen oder neuartigen Situationen beobachten, dass ein vermeintlich wohl bekanntes Zeichen seine Bedeutung ändert und dies einen Hinweis auf das Verständnis der Situation geben könnte - vielleicht ein Grund dafür, dass psychotische Erfahrungen viele Künstler zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts stark beeinflusst haben, die die Situation des Menschen in der Industriegesellschaft neu verstehen wollten [3].",

For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "title": "Sensory Deprivation in Geriatric Patients",
      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inborn organelle disorders, clinically heterogeneous, and biochemically characterized by accumulation of nondegraded macromolecules primarily in the lysosomal and other cellular compartments. Given the common and essential cellular function of the lysosomal system in different organs and systems, patients afflicted with these disorders present a broad range of clinical problems, including neurological problems, visceromegaly, and skeletal deformities. Onset of symptoms may range from fetal period to adulthood. The neurological problems include developmental delay, seizures, acroparesthesia, motor weakness, muscle wasting, behavioral/psychiatric disturbances, cerebrovascular ischemic events, and extrapyramidal signs. Patients may present with symptoms later that include psychiatric manifestations, are slowly progressive, and may precede other neurologic or systemic features. Most of LSDs are autosomal recessive; however, a few are X-linked with symptpmatic female carriers (e.g., Fabry disease). In most of them, the diagnosis is established by biochemical and/or molecular assays. In terms of management, disease-modifying therapies include enzyme replacement, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Patients and their families require genetic counseling regarding reproductive risks, disease prognosis, and therapeutic options. Investigations of disease molecular mechanisms provide insights into potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Supportive care has been the key and essential for most LSDs, resulting in substantial improvement in quality of life of patients and families.",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

The incidence is 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) but it ranges from 1-8 and 25 out of every 1000 born in developed and developing countries, respectively. The most frequent causes are detachment of the placenta, prolapse of the umbilical cord and uterine rupture. The diagnostic criteria include partial or total incapacity for the newborn to cry and breath at birth even when stimulated, requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room, Apgar < 5 in 5 and 10 minutes, acidemia (pH ≤ 7 and / or bases deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l), alterations of the conscience and the reflexes of Moro, grasping and suction, muscular stretching and muscle tone. The clinical forms are mild, moderate and severe. In the mild forms, the recovery is total in three days without, or with minimal, neurodevelopmental alterations. The moderate and severe forms cause permanent neurological deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (48%) or death (27%). The regular or amplitude integrated EEG and the magnetic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging performed between 24 and 96 hours and 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively, have a high diagnostic and prognostic value. Induced hypothermia (33.5° C for 72 hours) is recommended before 6 hours old. The result is a decrease in mortality (from 35% to 27%) and morbidity (from 48% to 27%).",

      "abstract": "Abstract The cauda equina is a collection of peripheral nerves in the common dural sheath within the lumbar spinal canal. Cauda equina syndrome, also known as bilateral acute radicular syndrome, usually is caused by a large, sequestered acute disc rupture at L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 that produces partial or complete lesions of the cauda equina–lower motor neuron lesions associated with flaccid paralysis, atrophy, and other conditions. Patients usually present with a history of back symptoms that have worsened precipitously. The syndrome includes back pain, bilateral leg pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, urinary bladder retention, and lax rectal tone. Cauda equina syndrome is rated using Diagnosis-related estimates (DRE) lumbosacral categories VI or VII. Category VI, Cauda Equina–like Syndrome Without Bowel or Bladder Signs, is used when there is permanent bilateral partial loss of lower extremity function but no bowel or bladder impairment. Category VII, Cauda Equina Syndrome with Bowel or Bladder Impairment, is similar to Category VI but also includes bowel or bladder impairment. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ) uses the term cauda equina syndrome with reference to both the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine regions; this usage is unique to the AMA Guides but maintains the internal consistency of the Injury Model, which is the best approach to date for assessing spine impairment.",

      "title": "Ruminative Coping with Depression",
      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

      "title": "Bereavement, Complicated Grief, and DSM, Part 1: Depression",
      "abstract": "The Case of Mr A Mr A is a 73-year-old man whose wife of 50 years died 5 weeks previously. He has no appetite, has lost 8 lb in the past month, consistently awakens at 4 am, “can’t think straight,” and no longer takes any pleasure in customary activities. He denies feelings of guilt or worthlessness. Although he denies suicidal intent, he confides that he wishes to join his dearly departed wife. When discussing his wife, he shows moderate psychomotor agitation and spends most days mindlessly sitting in front of his television. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR),1 Mr A does not have a psychiatric condition; consequently, treatment with antidepressants or formal psychotherapy is not indicated. Mr A would be assigned the V-code, bereavement, and reassured that nothing is wrong. However, according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10),2 Mr A has major depressive disorder (MDD). Ostensibly, decisions about treatment would be made just as they would after any other, non–bereavement-related, episode of MDD. The question to be addressed in the following discussion is whether the best available evidence more strongly supports the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10.",

      "abstract": "The lack of “fit” between legal and medical concepts is perhaps best shown in the psychiatric disability of injured workmen. In the particular case discussed in this article, the problem is illustrated (1) in the long-standing preexistence of organic brain disease over many years, (2) in the occurrence of a heart attack from which the claimant recovered in “physical” terms. The heart attack forced a break in his employment and made his previously subclinical disability obvious to employer, wife, and the claimant himself. The resulting disability featured depression, anhedonia, and loss of identity, thus becoming primarily psychiatric in nature. No one of these disorders is “causally related” as a single entity; the problem is the outcome of a cumulative stress in a person made highly vulnerable through prior deterioration. Of particular import is the demonstration of “context-dependence”: workers depend for their own sense of identity and responsibility upon their occupation, and the loss of work becomes itself a “causal” factor.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome and Anxiety Disorders: A Psychobiological Link",
      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient’s quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode. This article is an overview of the more common adverse events, which are seen with non-acute treatment with the SSRIs.",

Comorbid affective or substance abuse disorders did not predict psychotic symptoms.Psychotic episodes are common but not universal among patients with borderline personality disorder, regardless of whether a concurrent axis I disorder is present.

      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

      "abstract": "In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an \"all or nothing\" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods, fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants, psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation, surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression affects 6.5 million of the 35 million Americans ≥65 years of age. While depression usually begins earlier in life and recurs periodically, it can present for the first time in people 80–90 years of age as well. Depression throughout the lifespan has a genetic/biological component but is also very much affected by social environmental factors. As people age, demographic factors, social support, and negative life events remain important to overall mental health, while physical illness and disability begin to take on a much more prominent role. Depression in the elderly is associated with impairment, dependency, disability, and significant distress for the individual and their family. This population is likely to present with concomitant cognitive dysfunction and medical illness, which can complicate the identification and treatment of psychiatric conditions. Bereavement is almost universal in late life and is sometimes a deterrent to appropriate diagnosis and treatment of depression. Physical frailty and diminishing social resources further complicate the treatment of depression in the elderly. Elderly individuals respond well to standard pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatments for depression. However, due to the high rate of relapse of depression in this population, continuous treatment is often warranted. This monograph will review depression in the elderly in the context of social disruptions, such as bereavement, caregiver strain, interpersonal conflict, role transitions, and social isolation; late-onset vascular depression and cognitive impairment; and physical illness including disability.",

Recent research suggests that people with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) may be more prone to alcohol-related aggression than people without ASPD. As a group, people with ASPD have higher rates of alcohol dependence and more alcohol-related problems than people without ASPD. Likewise, in laboratory studies, people with ASPD show greater increases in aggressive behavior after consuming alcohol than people without ASPD. The association between ASPD and alcohol-related aggression may result from biological factors, such as ASPD-related impairments in the functions of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin) or in the activities of higher reasoning, or \"executive,\" brain regions. Alternatively, the association between ASPD and alcohol-related aggression may stem from some as yet undetermined factor(s) that increase the risk for aggression in general.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Not all headaches are fully defined or characterized by the current classification systems. The variability in headache descriptions and presentation may be influenced by individual or group factors, or may even suggest the discovery of a new or an atypical phenotype. This paper aims to describe a novel headache syndrome characterized by a burning sensation on the vertex. Recent findings Demographic and clinical profiles of 25 patients from a referral headache center in India were analyzed. The syndrome presents as episodic, burning headaches on the vertex (10–20 cm diameter). Most patients were women (16/25), with a mean age of 40.96 years (SD+ 0.75). Episodes occurred 1–3 times weekly or daily, lasting &lt;4 h (range: 1 min to 24 h). Associated symptoms included nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, or autonomic features (76%). Common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, and polycystic ovarian disease. Neurological exams were normal, except for a slight local temperature rise in 2 patients. Treatment responses varied, though two patients reported reduced frequency and severity after greater occipital nerve (GON) block. Summary This syndrome is not completely compatible with any other primary headache disorders like nummular headache, migraine, cluster, or tension-type headaches. It potentially involves small fiber pathways from the scalp. Further studies are needed to better understand its clinical features, gender predilection, mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatment options.",

Little is known about their coexistence with other non-functional movement disorders and their impact on the general disease burden. Investigating frequency and characteristics of functional movement disorders in GCH1-positive dopa-responsive dystonia patients. Twenty-one patients underwent a detailed clinical motor examination and completed self-questionnaires evaluating non-motor characteristics. Seven patients (33 %) had comorbid functional movement symptoms, including functional gait disorders (n = 7), balance disturbances (n = 7), and weakness (n = 5), dominating the clinical phenotype and resulting in disability with immobilization. None of them was previously diagnosed with or treated for the functional symptoms. Functional movement symptoms appeared suddenly (on average 18 years after the first dopa-responsive dystonia symptoms) and were unresponsive to L-Dopa. These patients showed significantly higher disability and received unnecessary treatments. Functional neurological movement disorders are common in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia and impact the clinical picture and the degree of disability. Diagnosing both disorders in an individual patient has substantial therapeutical implications because increases in L-Dopa dosages to treat functional symptoms should be avoided, and physiotherapy should relocate attention away from the affected body region so that movements in the affected body part can be executed without external control to facilitates automatic movements. Physiotherapy should be complemented by psychoeducation and psychotherapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Although the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be found in many “normal” people, these symptoms are present to a greater extent in those affected by the disorder. In these patients, ADHD symptoms cause substantial functional impairment. Therefore, the goal of treatment is not simply to reduce core symptoms, but also to decrease the level of impairment caused by these symptoms. Common impairments in adolescents and adults include academic and occupational problems that are particularly evident in the context of tasks requiring a high degree of organization or attentional function. These impairments result in problems related to task completion, prioritizing work and other obligations, and time management, etc. These symptoms often impact successful completion of tasks in school or at work, and can also result in a variety of problems in initiating and managing relationships (Slide 1). Mood and anxiety disorders often co-occur with ADHD in adults. The accumulation of experiences related to impaired academic and/or occupational performance, and or persistent relationship problems, due to the symptoms of ADHD, can lead to either depressed mood or anxiety related to performance and/or social situations. Therefore, in treating adults with ADHD, reduction of those co-occurring symptom presentations is also an important goal.",

The incidence of unprovoked seizures and epilepsy is slightly higher in men than in women and differs between the two sexes according to age, genetic background, underlying cause and, to some extent, the epilepsy syndrome. Concealment of the disease by women for sociocultural reasons is another explanation. As with incidence, the prevalence of epilepsy is higher in men than in women and sex dominance shifts between age groups. Migraine, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and several psychiatric illnesses have differing distribution in men and women. In these clinical conditions the risk of seizures is higher than expected and may thus affect men and women to a differing extent. The probability of long-term remission of epilepsy is similar in men and women and differences, where present, remain small when treatment is discontinued. In contrast, mortality from epilepsy prevails in men in both developed and developing countries. The use of antiepileptic drugs differs in men and women because of the differing tolerability and safety profile of the available compounds.",

In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

      "title": "Testing blood and CSF in people with epilepsy: a practical guide",
      "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory investigations, whilst not essential to the diagnosis of seizures or of epilepsy, can be fundamental to determining the cause and guiding management. Over 50% of first seizures have an acute symptomatic cause, including a range of metabolic, toxic or infectious cause. The same triggers can precipitate status epilepticus, either de novo or as part of a deterioration in control in individuals with established epilepsy. Some, such as hypoglycaemia or severe hyponatraemia, can be fatal without prompt identification and treatment. Failure to identify seizures associated with recreational drug or alcohol misuse can lead to inappropriate AED treatment, as well as a missed opportunity for more appropriate intervention. In individuals with established epilepsy on treatment, some laboratory monitoring is desirable at least occasionally, in particular, in relation to bone health, as well as in situations where changes in AED clearance or metabolism are likely (extremes of age, pregnancy, comorbid disorders of renal or hepatic function). For any clinician managing people with epilepsy, awareness of the commoner derangements associated with individual AEDs is essential to guide practice. In this article, we review indications for tests on blood, urine and/or cerebrospinal fluid in patients presenting with new‐onset seizures and status epilepticus and in people with established epilepsy presenting acutely or as part of planned monitoring. Important, but rare, neurometabolic and genetic disorders associated with epilepsy are also mentioned.",

However, this syndrome may be under-recognized by both clinicians and patients (i.e., low insight, particularly among children and adolescents), and is characterized by an insidious onset, dose-dependent effects (i.e., higher selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor doses are more likely to result in symptoms), and complete resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the offending drug. Treatment strategies may include a dose reduction of the offending selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, augmentation with a second drug, and/or discontinuation of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and subsequent treatment with a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant.",

      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

For conceptual clarity, it is helpful to consider that there are different ways in which emotional factors can exert an influence on the course of any illness. Several of these factors are briefly described as follows: 1. Occasionally the emotional state or set of attitudes of the patient may be reflected in his inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the therapeutic regimen prescribed for him. This difficulty may be encountered, of course, in every degree of severity ranging from mildly annoying uncooperativeness to defiance of medical advice with tragic consequences.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 31 US children and 1 in 45 US adults; autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of neurologic diversity, symptoms, challenges, strengths, and abilities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.",

In Malaysia, psychiatric disorders were responsible for 8.6% of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years and were ranked fourth as the leading cause of burden of disease by disease categories1. More and more evidence shows that physical illnesses are strongly associated with psychiatric disorders. Those with physical illnesses have much higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to that without2-3. The mechanisms of co-morbidity of psychiatric and physical illness are complex. It is a two-way interaction and there are five different possible ways to describe this4-5. Co-incidence or By-chance In clinical practice, the psychiatric illness may be coincidental and unrelated to physical problems, as both physical and psychiatric conditions are common in the general population. Such disorders do, however, complicate the management of the physical illness. For example, depression can predate the onset of the medical illness in up to 25% of patients with co morbid depression, and it is associated with an increase in somatic complaints5.

Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

If so can an augmentation of the support package or environment, or a specific psychological intervention, resolve or substantially improve the situation? If conservative measures and non pharmacological interventions have not been successful, is the problem severe enough to merit a trial of pharmacotherapy? For most of the BPSD considered in this chapter, there is very little evidence pertaining to treatment intervention, other than some notable trials of non-pharmacological approaches for the treatment of abnormal vocalizations. The potential side effects and consequences of drug interventions, particularly with neuroleptic agents, have been highlighted elsewhere (Chapter 15), but are particularly important when considering the absence of any adequate clinical trials.",

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most common symptom of multiple sclerosis and is perhaps the symptom with the most devastating impact on patient well-being. It is reported by 75% to 95% of individuals, and more than half describe it as the worst symptom of the disease. The mechanisms underlying the development of fatigue remain unclear; although fatigue is believed to be a primary symptom of MS (ie, related to the demyelinating processes of the disease), fatigue may also occur secondarily to factors such as sleep disturbances, depression, or the effects of medications. The highly variable presentation of MS and the number of agents used for disease modification and symptom management make it important for potential contributors to MS-related fatigue to be identified and managed appropriately. If fatigue continues despite elimination or adequate management of secondary causes, pharmacologic therapy may be required. Several agents have been reported to improve MS-related fatigue; however, only three have been investigated in controlled trials. Amantadine has been studied in several small controlled trials, and appears to be effective in one quarter to one third of those with mild-to-moderate fatigue. It has shown efficacy on a number of scales, including the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F) and the MS-Specific Fatigue Scale (MS-FS). The central nervous system (CNS) stimulant pemoline has demonstrated limited benefit in clinical trials and is often poorly tolerated, especially in higher doses. Recently, the wake-promoting agent modafinil has been shown to significantly improve MS-related fatigue on a number of commonly used fatigue assessment scales, including the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS).",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are often complicated by psychological and behavioural disturbances. Alzheimer’s disease is not free from such psychiatric complications. Alzheimer’s disease is most frequently the cause of dementia, and the prevalence and incidence of depressive symptoms are high. The prevalence is 40%, half of which are clinically significant and require treatment. When these depressive symptoms occur, they are often associated with other behavioural disturbances such as anxiety, irritability, delusions or apathy. Antidepressants are widely used in Alzheimer’s disease, and they are still prescribed primarily for the management of affective disorders, even though they may be effective in other psychological and behavioural problems. Longitudinal study design and survival analysis are rare. These studies identified functional decline, sleep disturbances and confrontational and aggressive behaviours as the principal predictors of the onset of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings confirm that it is important to look for psychiatric symptoms such as depression when non-specific behavioural disturbances such as confrontation or aggressiveness occur. Neuropsychiatric symptoms during the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and of Alzheimer’s disease in particular, offer an exciting area of research. We should consider the biological C.

The treatment of experiences of incest can induce new symptoms as well as reinforce still existing symptoms. Thus the free-floating anxiety, which is connected with the anxiety of impending doom in early childhood, can be reduced. During in-patient treatment the extent of free-floating anxiety of borderline patients can be reduced by the holding function of the therapeutic team. Reduction of the other symptoms can take place only subsequent to this. A therapy geared to the reduction of singular symptoms might be less successful.",

      "abstract": "Sexual health is often negatively affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but rarely discussed between patients and health care professionals. Experienced reasons for decreased sexual health vary among patients, but pain, stiffness, reduced mobility, fatigue and negative feelings towards one9s own body are common factors. In addition to negative effects experienced to be due to RA, there are also negative influences on sexual health by other factors, such as insufficient physical activity, low self-esteem, depression and stressful influences in life. Physiotherapy is a common intervention for patients with RA and patients have reported improved sexual health due to physiotherapy. Regular physiotherapy interventions for patients with RA often include coaching towards increasing physical activity levels, hydrotherapy, pain reductive treatment and mobility exercises, both individually and in groups. The physiotherapy interventions leading to improved sexual health (according to patients with RA) has been regular interventions for patients with RA and not specifically aimed at enhancing sexual health. The patients do seldom describe that the physiotherapist has informed them of how physiotherapy might enhance sexual health, but they have themselves experienced how physiotherapy has improved their sexual life. Patients describe that they experience joy, increased self-esteem and a more positive approach to their body, when participating in physiotherapy and that this positive feeling is affecting their life, including their sexual life. They also describe how increased physical capacity reduces fatigue and increases their capacity to engage in valued life activities, including sexual activities. The way that the physiotherapist can further enhance sexual health, is by informing the patient of how sexual health is linked to experienced symptoms of RA and how physiotherapy interventions, for example increasing physical activity, can enhance also sexual health. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "title": "Investigation des fonctions mnésiques impliquées dans le processus de rémission de l'état de stress post-traumatique",
      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

Such patients often actually do become weak, either from mere inaction, or from the malassimilation induced thereby and the worries they permit themselves; this is a familiar picture in a traumatic neurosis,<sup>1</sup>so-called.

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity.

Az együttműködés hiánya gondot okozhat a kivizsgálás, a diagnózis felállítását követő invazív beavatkozás vagy a gyógyszeres kezelés során. A noncompliance-hez vezető okok között jelentős szerepet töltenek be a szomatikus betegséggel párhuzamosan fennálló pszichiátriai zavarok. Célkitűzés: Noncompliance miatt kért pszichiátriai konzíliumok alapján a betegek hiányos együttműködését okozó leggyakoribb pszichiátriai zavarok feltérképezése. Módszer: A Szent László Kórház konzultációs-kapcsolati pszichiátriai ambulanciájának 5 éves beteganyagán végeztek a szerzők retrospektív vizsgálatot. Ebben a közleményben a noncompliance miatt kért pszichiátriai konzultációkról számolnak be. Eredmények: Demencia (27,3%) és hangulatzavar (40,9%) fordult elő leggyakrabban a noncompliance betegeknél. A cukorbetegség, a tüdő- és a vesebetegség volt gyakoribb a noncompliance miatt konzultáló betegek között, a teljes konzíliumi beteganyaghoz viszonyítva. Következtetések: Egyes krónikus, szomatikus betegségekben szenvedőknél gyakrabban előforduló komorbid depresszió és a depressziósok körében gyakrabban fellépő noncompliance miatt a cukorbetegeknél, a tüdő- és vesebetegeknél a depresszió szűrése és megfelelő kezelése hatékony eszköz lehet a noncompliance megelőzésében.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

The success and limitations of modern therapy were statistically determined. Many recovered schizophrenics continued to do well even without medication and social care. As a rule, schizophrenics had no endocrine pathology and endocrine patients were not schizophrenic. Neither a broken home in childhood nor an upbringing by a schizophrenic parent resulted in any important association with schizophrenia. However, a disturbed relationship with relatives and loved persons was more frequent in the anamnesis of schizophrenic women than of schizophrenic men.

It is thought to manifest in response to recurrent microtrauma during erection in those with risk factors that may include wound-healing disorders. The initial stage of PD is thought to last from 6 to 18 months, and it is characterized by an inflammatory period with pain in approximately one-third of men. This initial phase is followed by a chronic phase when pain typically resolves and the deformity stabilizes with no additional plaque development. PD has been reported to develop in up to 9% of adult males according to published literature, but the incidence may be even higher. The most frequently affected age group is men between 50 and 59 years. Because of the associated penile deformity and effect on sexual relations, psychosocial distress is very common in those with PD. It has been reported to negatively affect self-image, sexual activity, intimacy, and mood, and it is often associated with depression and erectile dysfunction (ED). At this time, nonsurgical treatments are unreliable and have variable efficacy, and surgical treatments are reserved for those with disabling disfigurement. Moreover, surgery may result in loss of penile length and ED, and there are only a few physicians in the United States that perform such surgeries. There is a great need to increase awareness of PD in patients and general practitioners, to elucidate the pathogenesis of PD, and for the development of novel treatments for this disfiguring disease.",

It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

Hyperactive basomedial nuclei played the role of a primary pathological determinant which caused the complex of emotional and behavioural disorders.

A number of signs could be considered as the evidence of the affective disorders (motivation suppression, enhanced irritation, anxious excitation). Stereotype behaviour, immobility, rigidity, different types of vegetative disorders (ptosis, constipation, piloerection, loss of weight, respiratory arrhythmia, dystrophic symptoms) were observed in most animals.

Most of these women are basically healthy, psychologically speaking. In some cases, however, this menstrual disturbance may continue for months or longer. In such instances, one may expect to find a neurotic conflict related to feminine identity as the cause. The therapeutic approach in these two alternative forms of secondary psychogenic amenorrhea (SPA) will differ; hence, it is essential that the gynecologist and psychiatrist distinguish between them. A case illustration is presented, describing in detail the treatment of a women with longstanding SPA which resolved with dynamically-oriented psychotherapy.",

The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as well as scales measuring impairment in activities of daily living, intellectual functioning, and social functioning were administered. The patients' CT scans were also examined.Seventeen patients had major depression and two had minor depression. The presence of left dorsolateral frontal lesions and/or left basal ganglia lesions and, to a lesser extent, parietal-occipital and right hemisphere lesions was associated with an increased probability of developing major depression. Compared to the nondepressed group, the group with major depression had a higher frequency of previous psychiatric disorder and showed evidence of poorer social functioning.Major depression occurs in about one-quarter of patients after traumatic brain injury. This is the same frequency as in other major disorders such as stroke. Major depression appears to be provoked by one or more factors that include poor premorbid social functioning and previous psychiatric disorder or injury to certain critical brain locations.",

Sunita Vohra, MD, MSc*\n\n\n \n\n1. *Complementary and Alternative Research and Education (CARE) Program, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. On behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Complementary and Integrative Medicine\n\nNocturnal enuresis (NE) is characterized by the involuntary discharge of urine at night in those 5 years of age or older. Primary NE (PNE) is diagnosed in an individual who has never achieved nighttime dryness; in secondary NE (SNE), incontinence follows a dry period of at least 6 months. In either, the enuresis must not be due exclusively to a medical condition or diuretic therapy. Prevalence is estimated at 5% to 10% among 5-year-olds, 3% to 5% among 10-year-olds, and 1% among those 15 years of age and older. Between 5% and 10% of cases resolve annually without treatment. (1) The causes of PNE and SNE remain unclear, although physical, neurologic, and psychological factors; genetics; sleep structure; and other medical conditions have been implicated. (2)\n\nTreatment for NE includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options, and many families are interested in complementary and integrative approaches. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback in treating NE.\n\nOriginally developed as a health-care tool in China thousands of years ago, the stimulation of specific points on the body (called acupoints) may be carried out by a variety of techniques, including insertion of thin needles (acupuncture), surface pressure (acupressure), electricity (electro-acupuncture), and laser (laser acupuncture). The effect of acupuncture on PNE was assessed through two recent systematic reviews. (3)(4) The Cochrane review summarized the results of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (5)(6)(7)\n\nIn the first study, 111 patients ages 5 to 15 years were assigned randomly to two different forms of acupuncture.

      "abstract": "Aging is a universal biologic process characterized by a progressive, predictable, inevitable evolution and maturation of an organism until death. The increasing biomedical and psychosocial uniqueness of the elderly requires an individualized approach to their care. The conventional disease-specific approach is not optimal for elderly patients for several reasons. First, people aged 75 years suffer from 3~4 chronic diseases on average. Second, many distressing symptoms or impairments among elderly patients, such as pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep problems, sensory impairments, and gait disorders cannot be ascribed to a single disease: instead, they result from the accumulated effects of physical, psychological, social, environmental, and other factors. Third, elderly patients vary in the importance they place on potential health outcomes. Three factors at least affect the clinical presentation in elderly patients: underreporting symptoms and impairments, changes in the patterns of presentation of individual illnesses, and an altered spectrum of health conditions. Clinical decision-making is further complicated in these patients because other persons, including the spouse, grown-up children, other relatives, and significant others, are often actively involved, particularly when the patient has cognitive impairment. The physician should understand clinical perspectives of aging and clinically relevant differences between young and old patients, including how elderly individuals behave when they are ill and how to interpret a changing constellation of multiple disease possibilities and interrelationships.",

      "abstract": "El puerperio es un período de mayor vulnerabilidad psíquica y la depresión posparto (DPP) es la complicación obstétrica más común. En el caso de la depresión, la última clasificación de la Asociación Americana de Psiquiatría (DSM-5) (2013) sustituyó el especificador “de comienzo en el posparto” por “con inicio en el periparto” porque muchas depresiones posparto comienzan en el embarazo. Empero, la denominación posparto sigue siendo válida, y debe conservarse con independencia de si su inicio fue en el posparto (hasta seis meses después del parto) o en el embarazo. Los síntomas depresivos puerperales pueden encontrarse en la disforia, la DPP (monopolar o bipolar) o la psicosis afectiva puerperal. La DPP y la psicosis comprometen el funcionamiento materno y se asocian a alteraciones del vínculo madre/hijo(a). El tratamiento oportuno y la prevención de estos trastornos minimizan los riesgos y favorecen la salud de la madre y su descendencia. The puerperium is a period of increased psychic vulnerability and postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common obstetric complication. In the last classification of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) (2013), the specifier “with postpartum onset” was replaced by the specificer “with peripartum onset” to acknowledge the fact that many PPDs start during pregnancy. However, the postpartum denomination remains a valid one and should be kept regardless the depression started in pregnancy or up to six months postpartum. Puerperal depressive symptoms may be found in the postpartum blues, unipolar or bipolar PPD or puerperal affective psychosis. PPD and psychosis cause impairment of maternal functioning and affect the mother-infant relationship. Timely treatment and prevention of these disorders minimize risks and favour the health of the mother and that of the offspring.",

The assault does not end with the action, the way of experiencing this trauma affects the later life of the child full of long-term negative effects, if it is not intervened at the right time. Harassment or sexual abuse leads also to a weak physical health. The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "La esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ELA) es un trastorno neurodegenerativo que afecta principalmente al sistema motor, pero en el que se reconocen cada vez más las manifestaciones extramotoras. La pérdida de neuronas motoras superiores e inferiores en la corteza motora, los núcleos del tronco encefálico y el asta anterior de la médula espinal da lugar a una debilidad muscular progresiva y atrofia. ALS a menudo tiene un inicio focal, pero posteriormente se propaga a diferentes regiones del cuerpo, donde la falla de los músculos respiratorios generalmente limita la supervivencia de 2 a 5 años después del inicio de la enfermedad. Hasta en el 50% de los casos existen manifestaciones extramotoras como cambios en el comportamiento, disfunción ejecutiva y problemas del lenguaje. En el 10%-15% de los pacientes, estos problemas son lo suficientemente graves como para cumplir los criterios clínicos de demencia frontotemporal (DFT). En el 10% de los pacientes con ELA, los antecedentes familiares sugieren un patrón de herencia autosómico dominante. El 90% restante no tiene familiares afectados y se clasifican como ELA esporádica. Las causas de la ELA parecen ser heterogéneas y solo se comprenden parcialmente. Hasta la fecha, se han asociado más de 20 genes con la ELA. La causa genética más común es una expansión repetida de hexanucleótidos en el Gen C9orf72 , responsable del 30-50% de la ELA familiar y del 7% de la ELA esporádica. Estas expansiones también son una causa frecuente de demencia frontotemporal, lo que enfatiza la superposición molecular entre ALS y DFT. Hasta el día de hoy, no existe una cura o un tratamiento eficaz para la ELA y la piedra angular del tratamiento sigue siendo la atención multidisciplinaria, que incluye el apoyo nutricional y respiratorio y el control de los síntomas. En esta revisión, se discuten diferentes aspectos de la ELA, incluida la epidemiología, la etiología, la patogenia, las características clínicas, el diagnóstico diferencial, las investigaciones, el tratamiento y las perspectivas futuras.",

It consists of a significant psychological disorder, which worsens during chemotherapy and can continue after the end of chemotherapy or in the recurrence of treatment and adversely affect the quality of life. Depression often accompanies many symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss and food disorders widely accepted as a result of cancer. The current study was to designed investigate depression symptoms among cancer patients during chemotherapy and its association with socio-demographic data. However, the difficult economic conditions and financial problems were the most obvious reasons and the unrecognised social problems of people who lost a partner or living alone who contributed to depression in the cancer patient. The treatment of patients with another type of cancer in another organ of the body or originally infected with Chronic diseases condition increases the patient's ill-being, lack of medication, supplies and frequent visits of the hospital, especially for visitors from villages outside cities, number of chemotherapy cycle Especially when the patient is responsible for the family. Patients during chemotherapy usually have symptoms as a result of their cancer or treatment side effect. These symptoms have been affected by the physical and emotional conditions of the patients and also have a negative effect on treatment. Cancer patients may be subject to psychological disorder during the clinical course of their illness.",

Findings for the somatosensory system (mechanoreception, warming and cooling thermoreception and pain) are less conclusive.

Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

Typically, PSD tends to occur between the third and sixth month following a stroke and may be identical to primary major or minor depressive episodes. However, some elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) with bilateral silent or overt subcortical strokes may present a different type of depression in which depressed mood is associated with cognitive disturbances with impairment of executive functions, psychomotor retardation, poor insight, and impaired activities of daily living. This type of PSD is known as vascular depression. Stroke and depressive disorders have a bidirectional relation, whereby not only are patients with stroke at greater risk of developing a PSD, but patients with a history of depression are at greater risk of developing a stroke. This relation is mediated by the existence of common pathogenic mechanisms operant in both conditions, which include anti-inflammatory processes, a hyperactive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that can result in a hypercoagulable state, as well as cardiac disturbances. The presence of PSD is associated with a worse recovery of activities of daily living, cognitive disturbances, and a higher mortality risk. Thus, early identification of PSD is of the essence so that treatment can be started without delay.",

This may be one of reasons why there exist minute descriptions of hundreds of symptoms and signs of various health disorders whereas the state of health is usually described in more general terms only as if it should not have such a distinct identity of its own as the health disorders do.

      "abstract": "The importance of the field of geropsychology (psychology of aging) is seen in the ever-increasing demographics of older adults. A psychologist needs to understand the various life stages that define different cohorts of older adults. Older adults are affected by the forces of stigma and ageism, which are of four types: personal, institutional, intentional, and unintentional. A majority of older adults experience age discrimination and stigmatization after the age of 65. The use of medical model of psychopathology causes contradictions and distortions, one of which is the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Assessment of deficits in olfactory functioning are potentially useful for a psychologist who is attempting to differentiate between cognitive disturbances of normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sexual interest remains high throughout old adult developmental stages, but sexual activity declines in most men as they age. While older adults are more likely to avoid illicit substances, many older adults having chronic pain from cancer or arthritis need opioid medications. Older adult abuse is a multifactorial phenomenon as the abuse may be emotional, financial, physical, sexual, or self-induced. Environmental geropsychology is based on Lewin's field theory model Lawton and Nahemow's ecological model, and an environmental geropsychologist focuses on the environmental component to develop interventions to change older adults' interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences. Heightened awareness of coming of death results in an existential crisis for many older adults causing a loss of their sense of purpose for their lives.",

Le plus grand nombre avaient été diagnostiqués “non différenciés”, quelques-uns portaient l'étiquette “familiale”. Tous les malades choisis pour cette étude présentaient des signes d'immaturité physique; tous révélaient des symptômes, en diverses combinaisons, des états endocriniens suivants:1. Retard de la croissance et du poids2. Défaut de fonction thyroïde3. Défaut de fonction du cortex surrénal4. Retard dans le développement des gonades.Le diagnostic de défaut de fonctionnement de l'hypophyse antérieure était évident.Les sujets ont été traités aux hormones thyroïdienne ou gonadotrophique ou une combinaison des deux vu qu'elles ont toutes deux la réputation d'influer directement sur les états mentaux. On n'a pas utilisé l'hormone de la croissance.Quatre anamnèses sont données pour illustrer les constatations. Dans trois cas, les sujets présentaient un défaut marqué du fonctionnement des gonades. Après un traitement aux hormones gonado-trophiques chorioniques, un sujet a présenté une hausse marquée du taux d'excrétion par 24 heures des 17-cétostéroïdes et en même temps, une amélioration marquée dans l'échelle des cotes de comportement. Lorsqu'on a discontinué temporaitement le traitement, les cotes ont baissé de nouveau. Après reprise du traitement, les testicules augmentèrent de volume et le canal inguinal se ferma. Les points obtenus par le deuxième malade sur l'échelle des cotes au début du traitement montrait une chute initiale ressemblant à la période d'agitation qui se produit au cours de la puberté physiologique chez les garçons. Le traitement a été discontinué et il s'est produit un déclin du taux des 17-cétostéroïdes et de l'âge mental. Le troisième sujet avait un faible taux de métabolisme basal. On lui a donné de la thyroïde desséchée; durant le traitement, le taux de métabolisme basai ne s'est élevé qu'une fois jusqu'à la normale; le taux d'excrétion par 24 heures n'a pas changé, mais le sujet a vu son état mental s'améliorer. Le quatrième sujet souffrait d'un défaut de fonctionnement des gonades et de la thyroïde, présentait de petits testicules et un faible taux de métabolisme basai. Après le traitement à l'hormone gonadothrophique, le sujet a fait peu de progrès sauf que sa cote de comportement a monté. Le traitement aux hormones n'a pas influé sur le défaut de fonctionnement de la thyroïde. Après l'institution du traitement à la thyroïde, le taux d'excrétion et celui des corticoïdes se mit à fluctuer, le taux de métabolisme basai monta; la cote de comportement se mit à grimper; le Q.I. resta le même. La taille du sujet augmenta de 4 pouces.Les mongoloïdes étudiés ne souffraient pas de déficience thyroïdienne. On estime que le défaut de fonctionnement des gonades chez les mongoloïdes peut être influencé par des états matériels des gonades au moment de la conception ou durant la grossesse.",

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S. Armed Forces) returned from the Persian Gulf and slowly (6-24 months or more) presented with a variety of complex signs and symptoms characterized by disabling fatigue, intermittent fevers, night sweats, arthralgia, myalgia, impairments in short-term memory, headaches, skin rashes, intermittent diarrhea, abdominal bloating, chronic bronchitis, photophobia, confusion, transient visual scotomata, irritability and depression and other signs and symptoms that until recently have defied appropriate diagnoses (1-3). These symptoms are not localized to any one organ, and the signs and symptoms and routine laboratory test results are not consistent with a single, specific disease (1). The signs and symptoms of GWI have been reported by 27/28 of the Coalition Armed Forces that were deployed against Iraqi units in Kuwait and Southern Iraq. The only exception is France. This brief review will summarize some of the possible exposures that occurred, the types of illnesses that resulted from these exposures, and some of the treatments that have been used on GWI patients. Because of space limitations, these topics cannot be discussed in detail. Instead, they are summarized along with a few references that should be useful.",

      "title": "AB0513 Fatigue in chinese patients with primary sjÖgren's syndrome: a cross sectional study",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) is the second most common systemic autoimmune disease, with a female-male ratio of 9:1, and characterized by sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth, including joint pains and multi-system involvement. pSS affects patients9 health-related quality of life (QoL), mental status and relationships with family. In pSS patients, symptoms such as fatigue, depression, arthralgia, fibromyalgia and general loss of well-being are commonly reported. Among them, fatigue is the most common problem that includes physical and mental fatigue, it can be as disabling as pain, which is difficult to manage and has a notable impact on QoL. Fatigue is a tiredness which may be mental, physical, or both, and that results in an inability to function at normal performance levels. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue remain unclear. A number of studies have reported the association of fatigue with Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS), whereas, because of the small sample size of pSS patients, we still lack large sample studies to find the relationship between pSS and fatigue. <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the relationship of fatigue severity to other clinical features in primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) and to identify factors contributing to the physical and mental aspects of fatigue in Chinese patients. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty-seven consecutive patients with PSS according to the American-European Consensus group (AEGG) criteria were included. Demographic, clinical and biological characteristics for all patients were collected. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Profile of Fatigue (ProF), Visual analogue scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), OHIP-14 Scale, MDADI Scale and PSQI Scale were adopted to assess fatigue, depression, anxiety, xerostomia, xerophthalmia and sleep disturbances. Associations with fatigue were compared using multivariate regression. <h3>Results</h3> 94% of our patients were women. The mean age of patients was 51.13±13.23 years, and the mean disease duration was 4.12±4.49 years. The mean oral dryness was 51±17.82, and the mean ocular dryness was 33.56±26.3. Abnormal fatigue, defined as an FSS score &gt;or=4, was present in 64% of the patients. Dry symptoms, low educational level, Pain and depression had a negative impact on fatigue scores. The regression models explained that Pain and depression were the strongest predictors of fatigue according to the FSS. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Fatigue is a tiredness which may be mental, physical, or both, and that results in an inability to function at normal performance levels. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue remain unclear. From our study, we found that psychosocial variables are determinants of fatigue, and fatigue is associated with depression, but depression is not the primary cause of fatigue in primary SS. Therefore, the investigation of the pathophysiologic correlates of physical and mental aspects of fatigue is needed to guide the development of more effective interventions. <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81401124);the Collaborative Innovation Program of Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University; College graduate research and innovation of Jiangsu Province (KYZZ16–0358, KYZZ15–0353). <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

For the purposes of this chapter, moderate adverse sedation-related events represent physiologic change that is extremely likely to lead to significant patient harm if unnoticed or responded to ineffectively by the sedationist. Apnea, airway obstruction, and laryngospasm are examples. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 400 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training so that sedationists can effectively respond to these adverse events or preempt them. Even though they are categorized as “moderate” and may not be associated with harm in and of themselves, these events may certainly progress to produce significant harm.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

The disorder has a resemblance to many other disorders described in the past including myalgic encephalitis and post-infective fatigue; however, the term itself and the criteria for diagnosing this disorder were first laid out in 1988. The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders. Non-pharmacological measures like graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy seem to work better for treatment than pharmacological measures. This narrative review takes an overview of chronic fatigue syndrome from a generalist standpoint and looks into the clinical features, etiopathogenesis and management of this disorder.",

Methods Patients were investigated medically, psychiatrically and neuropsychologically and in part neuroradiologically. Results Patients were adult males with Eastern or Central European background and no known previous psychiatric or medical illnesses. They immigrated to Germany or Canada and encountered several difficulties in the process of migration or adaptation to the new country. All developed severe psychiatric dissociative symptoms after objectively minor stresses, which occurred several years after their immigration to the new country of residence. Despite adequate treatment, their symptoms followed a chronic course. The patients’ neuropsychological profiles shared similarities, such as executive functioning deficits (e.g. limited cognitive flexibility) and impairments of emotional processing in addition to severe autobiographical amnesia. Conclusions We propose that stresses related to immigration and acculturation could trigger dissociative memory disorders in immigrants via a dysregulation of the hormonal stress responses, which is mediated by individual characteristics (cognitive flexibility, emotional processing abilities, language competence and cultural affiliations).",

      "abstract": "The NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease (AD) state that “gait disturbances at the onset or very early in the course of the illness make the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease uncertain or unlikely,‘’ yet there have been few studies documenting the validity of the statement. We therefore reviewed all cases of pure autopsy-proven AD in the Ramsey Brain Bank to determine how frequently an abnormal gait was noted at time of presentation. Any reported gait disturbance was considered an abnormal gait. Only cases for which medical records were available documenting the patient's presentation for dementia were included. Cases were excluded if any other pathology was present that may have contributed to the patient's dementia or to a gait disorder, if neuroleptic medication had been used, or if there was a preexisting gait disorder. Clinical dementia severity at time of presentation was graded as mild, moderate, or severe per DSM-IIIR criteria. Of the 95 cases that met study criteria, none of the 36 patients with mild dementia were reported to have had an abnormal gait. Sixteen percent of the patients with moderate and 32% with severe dementia had gait abnormalities reported. This study confirms the statement regarding gait in the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.",

Es una entidad rara, benigna y autolimitada de causa desconocida y que se diagnostica por exclusion.\r\nSuele aparecer entre la tercera y la cuarta decadas de la vida, pero el rango de edad de los casos reportados va desde los 5 hasta los 52 anos. Solo una minoria de pacientes tiene antecedentes personales o familiares de migrana y se ha reportado un prodromo viral en el 25-40% de los casos. Los deficits neurologicos mas comunes son hemiparesia, hemiparestesia y disfasia (la afectacion del hemisferio izquierdo ha sido reportada mas frecuentemente), siendo los sintomas visuales mas raros. Aunque el deficit suele ser focal, tambien se han reportado manifestaciones difusas como un estado confusional agudo. Usualmente el deficit precede al dolor de cabeza, pero la cefalea puede ser el primer signo de un episodio. Aunque HaNDL es considerado un desorden monofasico, el 75% de los pacientes presentan ataques repetidos que ocurren por semanas e incluso meses despues del episodio inicial y los deficits neurologicos frecuentemente varian entre episodios, involucrando diferentes regiones cerebrales. Los sintomas y signos mejoran paralelamente a la disminucion de pleocitosis en el LCR. En el electroencefalograma realizado durante el periodo sintomatico se ve un enlentecimiento excesivo unilateral, siendo el bilateral menos frecuente; dicha alteracion desaparece tras el episodio sintomatico y no se han reportado alteraciones epileptiformes.\r\nUna vez establecido el diagnostico, el tratamiento es sintomatico y de soporte, junto con educacion sobre el cuadro. Si el paciente retorna por nuevos episodios, se debe descartar siempre otras causas.",

      "title": "Anorexia in Exercise and Sport",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders that are associated with severe disturbances in eating behavior are called “eating disorders.” According to the American Psychiatric Association1, a mental disorder consists of “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” Of particular attention here is the eating disorder of anorexia nervosa. This disorder amounts to a refusal to maintain a normal body weight. In the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV, pp. 544–545), the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (See Table 1) are associated with physical symptoms (abnormal body weight, amenorrhea) and psychological symptoms (fear in gaining weight and body image disturbances).Table 1: A. Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia NervosaDiscussion: Although the incidence of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa is only about 1% in the U.S. population, its prevalence among athletes in sports that emphasize leanness has been estimated to be much higher. Part of this confusion comes from misinterpreting scores on questionnaires such as the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) or the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). These standardized instruments are not designed to determine psychopathology since it takes a clinical interview to determine if the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are met. Instead, the EDI and EAT are useful in determining who might be at risk for meeting the diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa. Athletes in sports that emphasize leanness will often have elevated scores on the drive for thinness scale of the EDI2. However, when athletes are subjected to a clinical interview, most of those classified as “at risk,” are not found to have a true clinical relevant “eating disorder.” Higher scores on the EDI, for instance, may be only be a rationale response on the part of the athlete and may not represent a clinical eating disorder. As O'Connor and Smith3 have pointed out, a higher drive for thinness score may merely represent a desire to perform well, especially in light of the time the athlete has devoted to the sport. Evidence from several sources suggests that athletes are more apt to have “subclinical or disordered eating patterns,” particularly when their sports are in-season. However, the disordered eating patterns seen in most athletes are not of the severity that would qualify as a clinically diagnosed eating disorder.",

The lack of awareness of this head pain may possibly be due to its rarity and problems with making the diagnosis. In the present work, the long‐term result of minor, decompressive surgery of the supraorbital nerve in five patients is reported. The immediate improvement was good and, after a mean observation time of more than 6 years, an improvement of 50% to 100% was observed (mean, circa 85%). In the two patients with the longest postoperative observation time, approximately 8 years, pain has not recurred. The pain was severe, leading to suicidal thoughts in several patients. The long‐term course was intermittent or continuous. The pain was generally unilateral, but was bilateral in one patient. Generally, there was lack of, or only minor benefit from drug treatment, including carbamazepine and indomethacin. There was clearly tenderness over the supraorbital nerve, especially at its outlet, and in some subjects occasionally, a slight local loss of sensation. Definite trigger zones were not present. Supraorbital nerve blockade generally provided instant and considerable pain relief. The persistence of protracted unilateral forehead/ocular pain, tenderness over the nerve, and repeated blockade effect strongly suggests the diagnosis.",

Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) encompasses disturbances of libido, erectile function, ejaculation, orgasm, and detumescence, and affects up to 10% of middle-aged or older men. Endocrine disorders should be considered in this context, although non-endocrine factors, particularly psychosexual ones, may be more important. Of all hormonal disorders, diabetes mellitus (DM) is, worldwide, the most common and important cause of organic erectile dysfunction (ED), increasing the risk three-fold compared to men without a history of DM. By comparison, male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from subphysiological testosterone levels due to a perturbation of the HPT axis at one or more levels, is a far less common cause of sexual dysfunction.",

We report four cases of hyperCKemia, two of which were physiological or due to non-neuromuscular factors (medication, physical activity).

In these two cases, specific aspects of the history or physical examination prompted further investigations.

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

These findings might well reflect biological changes of the depressive brain, e.g., decrease in serotonin, GABA, and possibly increase in CRH, etc. Treatment of “bladder SSD” can follow that of general depression/anxiety and also add bladder drugs.",

      "title": "Suicide in Severe Depression: A Longitudinal Case-Control Study",
      "abstract": "Popular Abstract in Swedish Popularvetenskaplig sammanfattning Personer som ar deprimerade loper storre risk att bega sjalvmord an de som har andra psykiska storningar. Studier har visat att cirka 6-15% av alla patienter med affektiv sjukdom begar sjalvmord. Vidare har det visat sig att cirka halften av alla manniskor som tar livet av sig har haft en depression. Man har darfor sokt efter riskfaktorer inom depressionsgruppen. Sjalvmordsforsok ar den viktigaste kliniska riskfaktorn for deprimerade likaval som for andra grupper. Man har ocksa funnit skillnader mellan sjalvmordsfall och kontroller betraffande symptom, sociala bakgrundsfaktorer, personlighet och biologiska markorer. Somnloshet, tidig foraldraforlust, att leva ensam och for kvinnor histrionisk personlighet ar exempel pa riskfaktorer, liksom laga halter av ett amne i ryggmargsvatskan (5-HIAA). Sjalvmord foregas ofta av forsok och dessa ar i sin tur foregangna av sjalvmordstankar. Man har darfor talat om en sjalvmordsprocess, dar yttre pafrestningar leder till hopploshet, sjalvmordstankar, sjalvmordsforsok, som upprepas och blir allvarligare till sin karaktar och slutligen fullbordat sjalvmord. Samtidigt ar det endast en minoritet av alla som har sjalvmordstankar, som gor sjalvmordsforsok och av dessa i sin tur endast ett fatal som sa smaningom tar livet av sig, cirka 10-15%. Det ar darfor angelaget att urskilja vilka patienter med sjalvmordsforsok, som ar i riskzonen for fullbordat sjalvmord sa smaningom. Jamforelser mellan dem som gjort allvarliga eller upprepade forsok har inte givit entydiga resultat. Daremot har man kunnat identifiera riskfaktorer pa lang och kort sikt. Depressioner ar forenade med okad dodlighet aven i somatiska sjukdomar, och en fragestallning for avhandlingen har varit om denna okade risk kvarstar sent i forloppet och om sjalvmordsrisken forblir densamma. Slutligen uppstar fragan om gangse somatiska behandlingar, antidepressiv medicin och elektrisk behandling, som ar sa effektiva vid depressionsbehandling, ocksa kan forebygga sjalvmord. Ett flertal studier, men inte alla, har visat att deprimerade patienter som tagit livet av sig ofta inte fatt tillracklig behandling. Kontrollerade studier har emellertid inte kunnat pavisa nagon klar skillnad som tyder pa forebyggande effekt av antidepressiv terapi med mediciner eller el-behandling. Kombinationen av elbehandling och uppfoljande antidepressiv medicinering har inte undersokts i tillrackligt stora material for att kunna pavisa nagon skillnad. Denna avhandling behandlar djupa depressioner/melankoli. Den utgar fran de multiaxiala skattningar som gjordes av inneliggande patienter pa psykiatriska klinken under 50- och 60-talen. Under denna tid fick 1206 patienter den namnda diagnosen (506 man och 700 kvinnor). Vid en forsta uppfoljning 1984 hade 103 patienter tagit livet av sig. Av dessa utvaldes de som hade en primar depression, alltsa ingen tidigare diagnos, for undersokning. Darvid ingick 89 patienter i studien (38 man och 51 kvinnor). Lika manga kontroller ur samma material utvaldes matchade for kon, alder och forsta inlaggningsar med diagnosen. En blind genomgang av journalerna gjordes med skattningar av en rad variabler, som sjalvmordsbeteende, behandling m m. I en andra omgang gjordes en uppfoljning av dodligheten hos samma patienter fran 1984-1998. Da hade ytterligare 14 patienter tagit livet av sig (8 man och 3 kvinnor). Avhandlingen har behandlat riskfaktorer, utveckling av sjalvmordsbeteende, sen dodlighet (efter 15 ar och mer) samt behandling vid sjalvmordet. Studie 1 Sprod/sensitiv personlighet och hereditet for psykos var relaterade till sjalvmord i den manliga gruppen. I den kvinnliga gruppen var sjalvmordsoffren oftare ensamstaende, negativa till behandling och hade oftare gjort sjalvmordsforsok. Nagot ovantat hade kontrollerna oftare haft en disharmonisk uppvaxt och hade oftare en fysisk sjukdom. Detta kan tyda pa att de som begick sjalvmord var mera sarbara an de andra. Studie 2 Livsleda, dodsonskan, sjalvmordstankar och planer skilde inte mellan dem som begick sjalvmord och kontroller. Daremot var livsleda relaterat till sjalvmord for man med sprod/sensitiv personlighet och ”tvingande” sjalvmordstankar for man med psykos. Det var vanligare att kvinnor tog livet av sig utan att ha kommunicerat sjalvmordstankar eller gjort sjalvmordsforsok an det var for man. Studie 3 Sjalvmordsforsok predicerade som vantat for sjalvmord. Det galler for man som bara haft depressioner och for kvinnor som aven haft skov av forhojd sinnesstamning. Sjalvmordsforsokens karaktar, som metod, svarighetsgrad och upprepning skilde inte mellan sjalvmord och kontroller och kan darfor inte sagas oka risken. Daremot borjade kvinnor som senare tog livet av sig oftare med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok jamfort med sina kontroller. Stressande livshandelser var ungefar lika vanliga fore det forsta sjalvmordsforsoket hos sjalvmord och kontroller. De senare gjorde emellertid oftare upprepade och svara forsok efter utlosande handelser. Dessutom var handelserna oftare allvarliga i kontrollgruppen. Detta tyder an en gang pa en storre sarbarhet hos dem som senare begar sjalvmord. Dessa gor istallet fler upprepade forsok ju fler depressiva skov de far. Tva sjalvmordsprocesser kan beskrivas i den kvinnliga gruppen: 1. En sjalvmordskarriar som ofta borjar med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och darfor inte uppvisar nagon okning i svarighetsgrad; upprepade forsok relaterade till depressionsforloppet snarare an yttre handelser. Denna karriar slutar ofta med fullbordat sjalvmord. 2. En karriar som borjar med ett mindre allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och senare i forloppet uppvisar allvarliga forsok, ofta utlosta av yttre handelser. Denna karriar har ofta god prognos. Den sjalvmordsprocess som beskrivits i litteraturen fanns saledes hos kontrollerna! Detta ar faktiskt inte orimligt eftersom tidigare studier gjorts pa personer som gjort sjalvmordsforsok av vilka de flesta overlever och saledes kan forvantas likna vara kontroller. Studie 4 Dodligheten sent i forloppet var okad i andningsorganens sjukdomar, sjalvmord och osakra sjalvmord for man och okad for alla orsaker sammanlagt och sjalvmord for kvinnor. Sjalvmord ar dock mindre vanligt sent jamfort med tidigare i forloppet. Man begar oftare an kvinnor sjalvmord sent i forloppet. Denna skillnad fanns inte tidigare vid en undersokning av samma material. Den totala dodligheten i sjalvmord ar hittills 10%, alltsa nagot hogre an de 6%som nyligen kalkylerats for depressioner i allmanhet (inte sa djupa som dessa). Den hogsta risken for sjalvmord foreligger i de yngre aldersgrupperna for bade man och kvinnor, medan kvinnor visar en ny topp mellan 50 och 60. Studie 5 Behandling vid sista kontakten fore sjalvmordet undersoktes och jamfordes med kontrollernas. Darvid delade vi upp sjalvmorden i dem som hade kontakt med kliniken i samband med sin sista depression fore sjalvmordet, dvs inom sex manader, da behandlingen kunde tankas ha effekt. Det visade sig att det inte fanns nagon skillnad i behandling mellan sjalvmord och kontroller ifraga om medicinering med antidepressiva eller elbehandling. Inte heller fanns det nagon skillnad i svar pa behandling i form av forbattring. Daremot hade kontroller som fatt elbehandling oftare fatt antidepressiva som uppfoljning. Detta tyder pa att uppfoljning med medicinering efter el-behandling kan forebygga sjalvmord. (Less)",

The multiple aetiologies of these disorders are imperfectly understood, and tend to be grouped under the broad heading of cerebral palsy.\n\nCerebral palsy is usually defined as a non-progressive neurological syndrome caused by injury to the immature brain, although recent data have questioned whether the pathological progress is genuinely non-progressive.1 The predominant feature is motor impairment, although about half of the affected population will have significant cognitive or intellectual impairment, and these children comprise about 50% of the total number of those with severe mental retardation in the community.2 Associated features such as visual impairment, hearing loss, or feeding problems are common.\n\nThe birth prevalence of cerebral palsy shows geographical variations, but is generally in the range of 1.5-3 per 1000 live births.3 Trends in prevalence over time have been somewhat contradictory; a fall from 2.24 to 1.9 per 1000 occurred in Sweden between 1954-8 and 1967-70,4 whereas in Western Australia a significant rise from 2.2 to 2.5 per 1000 occurred over a similar period.5 However, in the past two decades most investigators have found a significant increase in the birth prevalence of cerebral palsy, due largely to an increase in the rates recorded for extremely small or preterm infants.6 There is some evidence that this increase is now being reversed.7 \n\nEpidemiological analysis has defined a large number of risk factors for cerebral palsy, including low birth weight, preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, neurological disorder in mother or sibling, thyroid disease or therapy during pregnancy, thyroid hormone deficiency in preterm infants, low placental weight, chorioamnionitis, birth asphyxia, and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.

      "abstract": "O assoalho pelvico e um conjunto de estruturas, como fascias, ligamentos e musculos que formam a porcao inferior da cavidade abdomino-pelvica. Dentre outras funcoes, e responsavel em manter a continencia urinaria. A perda das funcoes dessas estruturas, seja por lesao nervosa direta ou por distensao/laceracao muscular, pode reduzir a capacidade do assoalho pelvico e enfraquecer o mecanismo de continencia permitindo a perda urinaria, assim, interferindo negativamente na qualidade de vida causando limitacoes fisicas, sociais, ocupacionais e ou sexuais. A Esclerose Multipla (EM) e a Mielopatia Associada ao HTLV-1 (HAM/TSP) sao desordens neurologicas cronicas, caracterizadas por ataque auto-imune a bainha de mielina causando desmielinizacao do nervo afetado, no qual geralmente resulta na diminuicao da conducao pelo nervo. Um metodo de avaliacao que vem sendo recentemente utilizado para avaliar a funcao dos musculos do assoalho pelvico e a eletromiografia (EMG) com uso de sensor vaginal. Alem de avaliar a capacidade de contracao muscular, a EMG registra a amplitude de contracao em microvolts (µV), sendo que os valores registrados em repouso caracterizam o tonus basal da musculatura. Durante a contracao muscular, a EMG oferece informacoes sobre as fibras fasicas que produzem contracoes de maxima amplitude e maior tempo de duracao. O estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a atividade mioeletrica da musculatura do assoalho pelvico de mulheres portadoras de EM, mielopatia associada ao HTLV-1 e mulheres saudaveis. Foi utilizado um eletromiografo Miotool 400, para a captacao da atividade mioeletrica. Participaram do estudo 15 mulheres, sendo 5 pacientes em cada grupo. Os resultados demonstraram que as mulheres infectadas com o virus HTLV-1 possuem um maior tonus basal da musculatura do assoalho pelvico, em comparacao com as pacientes portadoras da EM. Em relacao a forca de contracao total, as mulheres com o virus HTLV-1 tiveram uma melhor captacao do sinal eletrico dos MAP comparando-se com as doadoras saudaveis e as portadoras de EM. Em geral, as portadoras de EM apresentaram uma menor chegada do sinal eletrico em todos os quesitos avaliados, tanto no tonus basal como nas contracoes voluntarias. Acredita-se que devido o acometimento neurologico das pacientes com EM ser maior do que o das pacientes com HTLV-1 que se apresentaram assintomaticas, a conducao do sinal eletrico ate a musculatura do assoalho pelvico e em menor quantidade.",

ED could be operationalized as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exercise, leading to clinically impairment or distress. Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

      "title": "Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, and airway compromise. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Progressive hydrocephalus, seizures, spasticity, spine instability or stenosis, eye anomalies, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, poor growth, dental anomalies, developmental delays, and respiratory issues are managed in the standard fashion. Obstructive sleep apnea may be treated with adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, although affected individuals have a higher surgical complication rate; ventilator support (CPAP, BiPAP) can also be considered. Precautions are needed during anesthesia to address airway maintenance, as progressive upper airway obstruction and cervical spine instability are common. Poor bone health may require supplementation with vitamin D and encouragement of weight-bearing exercises. Alternative routes for nutrition (tube feeding) are frequently necessary. Surveillance: Monitoring of head circumference at each visit; serial brain/spine imaging, as needed based on symptoms; cervical spine imaging prior to any procedure that requires neck extension. At least annual vitamin D level, eye examination with intraocular pressure measurement, EKG, echocardiogram, and audiology evaluation. Abdominal ultrasound, sleep study and pulmonary function tests, neuropsychiatric testing, and assessment of blood and urine acid-base balance as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neck hyperextension (including hyperextension used for intubation) because of the risk of spinal cord compression; foods that are a choking hazard. Genetic Counseling Multiple sulfatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% change of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible using molecular genetic techniques if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

      "abstract": "Traditional beliefs about climacteric symptoms and widespread imaginations about unwanted effects of estrogens in the pill have long been interfering with the recommendation of an early onset of effective replacement therapy. The somatic symptoms of rush or genital atrophia have later on been classified as hard evidence to justify a therapy, much more than the predominant psychic signs occurring in the postmenopausal years as mental depressions, decrease or lacking of libido, nervousness, insomnia. Those signs were neglected as weaker indications responding even to a placebo treatment. The present knowledge understands somatic and psychosomatic signs as an entiety, both being accessible to hormonal replacement therapy. 85% of the postmenopausal signs can effectively be treated with hormones. What is now known about atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism and osteoporosis in ageing woman adds further justification to even the prophylactic use of estrogens. Natural estrogens administered orally, transdermally or parenterally are the means of choice. The dosage might be tailored on the relief of symptoms (and afterwards reduced to a mere maintaining dosage), or given in a fixed cyclic regimen. The treatment cycle will be three or four weeks, a progestogen should be added for the last 12-14 days. Only one estrogen-androgen combination has survived (Gynodian). The transdermal application (in three different concentrations) with administration twice a week is in progress. Indications and contraindications for transdermal estrogens are similar to estrogens administered orally.",

      "abstract": "Female sexual dysfunction is associated with personal distress and includes female sexual interest and arousal disorder (including former hypoactive sexual desire disorder), female orgasmic disorder, genitopelvic pain and penetration disorder, and substance- or medication-induced sexual dysfunction. These disorders are remarkably common among women, with an estimated prevalence of 20-40%. It is our responsibility as obstetrician-gynecologists to identify risk factors and screen for female sexual dysfunction. Appropriate screening allows for further exploration into sexual function and dysfunction and, ultimately, determination of associated distress. Treatment often involves addressing the underlying issue through therapy or medical management. For female sexual interest and arousal disorder, treatment generally includes cognitive behavioral therapy, often with a mindfulness focus, and consideration of pharmaceutical management. Female orgasmic disorder is treated with education and awareness, as well as therapy. Evaluation for underlying etiology is particularly critical for genitopelvic pain and penetration disorder to allow treatment of an underlying condition. Finally, substance- or medication-induced sexual dysfunction is best managed by cessation of the implicated substance and consideration of adjunctive therapy if dysfunction is related to antidepressants. Female sexual dysfunction is often overlooked in clinical practice; however, there are effective medical and psychological options for management.",

      "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) involving the leg can occur in association with various traumatic and nontraumatic conditions, and it can have serious longterm consequences when unrecognized or untreated. Nontraumatic causes of ACS, such as those associated with cases of prolonged immobilization and/or extremity compression, can be easily overlooked, and several cases of ACS occurring with prolonged surgical positioning can be found in the literature. We present the case of a 19-year-old Army paratrooper who developed acute anterior and lateral compartment syndrome of the lower extremity after being immobilized in an aircraft for hours with several hundred pounds of equipment compressing his lower extremities. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of ACS occurring as a result of prejump conditions. It demonstrates a potentially serious complication that could result in medical separation and/or permanent disability of the service member. ACS of the extremity should be considered in any Soldier who is required to bear heavy loads, is immobilized for several hours at a time, and complains of symptoms such as extremity pain, numbness, and weakness.",

The symptoms of PMS regularly occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve by the end of menstruation. The severe and predominantly psychological form of PMS is called 'premenstrual dysphoric disorder'. PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced progesterone sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter dysfunction. Treatment is aimed at suppressing ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity.

Four case histories are described of men who masturbated in an idiosyncratic manner.

It is suggested that the primary care physician or specialist (urologist or neurologist) screen for this problematic style when presented with male sexual dysfunction. Further, and more controversially, it is suggested that a primary prevention model would argue for masturbatory instruction in the home, classroom, orpediatric clinical setting.",

      "abstract": "Karbamazepin je antiepileptik s izrazitom antikonvulzivnom i psihotropnom aktivnoscu. Primjenjuje se u lijecenju epilepsije, kronicnih bolnih sindroma, trigeminalne neuralgije i psihijatrijskih bolesti (bipolarni poremecaj, rezistentna depresija, „ borderline“ sindrom). Vecina bolesnika dobro podnosi uzimanje lijeka. Kao nuspojave se mogu javiti gubitak apetita, mucnina, ataksija, dvoslike, povracanje, uz mogucnost rijetkih nuspojava kao agranulocitoza, aplasticna anemija, pseudolimfom, sistemski lupus eritematodes (SLE ). Karbamazepinom induciran SLE nastaje najranije unutar nekoliko mjeseci od pocetka administracije lijeka. Ova nuspojava je iznimno rijetka i javlja se kao „ izolirani slucaj“ (manje od 0.001%). Klinicka manifestacija SLE iskazuje se kao osip, povisena tjelesna temperatura, bolovi u zglobovima, s nalazom leukopenije, uz pozitivna antinuklearna antitijela (ANA). Nakon ukidanja lijecenja karbamazepinom dolazi do normalizacije leukopenije i titra ANA. Prikazujemo slucaj bolesnice rođene 1974.g. koja se lijeci od epilepsije od 8.g. života. Inicijalno se radilo o grand mal atakama, a tijekom iducih nekoliko godina pojavili su se i drugi klinicki fenotipovi - kompleksna parcijalna epilepsija temporalnog ishodista uz miokolonizme. Antiepilepticko lijecenje se zapocinje metilfenobarbitonom i fenitoinom, a cetiri godine kasnije se u lijecenje uvede karbamazepin. Tijekom 1998.g. dolazi do prvih klinickih znakova SLE u vidu kožnog osipa, afta, umora, malaksalosti s nalazom leukopenije, hipergamaglobulinemije i pozitivnog titra ANF (antinuklearnog faktora). Zapoceto je lijecenje klorokinom, a iskljucen je karbamazepin. Tijekom daljnjeg tijeka bolesti provodi se kombinirana antiepilepticka terapija, ali s nedovoljnom kontrolom epileptickih ataka, te rjeđim relapsima i dužim remisijama SLE tijekom kojih dolazi do normalizacije krvne slike: nalazi ADNA (Antitijela na dvolancanu DNA), ANF, ENA (antitijela na ekstrahirani nuklearni antigen), aCL (antikardiolipinska antitijela) su negativni. U literaturi se navodi mogucnost indukcije SLE kod lijecenja karbamazepinom, kao i fenitoinom koji je bolesnica tijekom lijecenja uzimala u dualnoj terapiji s karbamazepinom. Postavlja se pitanje da li uvijek po ukidanju antiepileptika dolazi do spontane regresije simptoma SLE, ili on može prijeci u klinicki oblik idiopatskog SLE s relapsima i remisijama osnovne bolesti, sto mislimo da je slucaj u nase bolesnice. Buduci da komorbiditet epilepsije i SLE nije rijedak, kao i obzirom na sve cesca promisljanja da je jedan od patofizioloskih cimbenika epilepsije upala, dodatno bi se trebala obratiti pozornost pri odabiru antiepilepticke terapije.",

      "abstract": "Otello syndrome derives its name from Shakespeare's drama (character) and, clinically, describes a person with delusions of the partner's infidelity. A variety of other psychopathology may present: obsessive-compulsive features, alcohol dependency, voyeurism, sadism, possessiveness and domineering, hyper-sexuality, paranoid attitude, abuse of different nature, violent behaviour, including, occasionally, homicide. Yet, in the author's opinion, the syndrome, unless it presents itself as obviously absurd, is frequently missed. Management is rather difficult and does not always result in recovery but, if not treated with neuroleptics, it would render any other means of treatment useless. The condition could pose a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, it also poses an ethical dilemma whether to warn the spouse of the psychotic condition of the partner, the poor prognosis and possible implications of its existence. Moreover, the long-term partners of such patients frequently present with the symptoms of dependency, submissiveness or even masochism. The paper discusses the abovementioned issues, including the likely psychodynamics, biological background, historical and social elements and possible effective management.

Forensic psychiatry also deals with questions of responsibility, treatment of psychiatrically ill offenders, and prediction of dangerousness of delinquents. Aggressive delinquency of patients with psychosis is about five times higher compared to the general population. Conversely, the risk for individuals with schizophrenia to become a victim of violence is several times higher than that of committing a violent crime. While aggression is part of human nature, mediated, in part, by the interaction of genes and childhood experiences, there is no reason for exculpation of delinquency based on the fact that criminal behaviour has also a biological dimension. Criminal offences often concern decisions based on one’s life-history strategy or evolved psychological mechanisms gone awry, including partner violence (homicide, sexual assault, stalking), paraphilic disorders, and infanticide.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.",

      "abstract": "The concept of a 5-HT related, anxiety and/or aggression-driven, stressor-precipitated depression is formulated and discussed. It comprises the following elements. The 5-HT ergic disturbances found in some depressed individuals - and of them particularly lowered CSF 5-HIAA - are linked to the anxiety- and the aggression-components of the depressive sydrome. In this type of depression - called 5-HT related depression - dysregulation of anxiety and/or aggression are primordial and mood lowering is a derivative phenomenon. In other words this is a group of anxiety/aggression-driven depressions. The 5-HT ergic impairment in certain types of depression is a trait-phenomenon, ie, persists during remission. This disturbance makes the individual susceptable for perturbation of anxiety- and aggression-regulation. Anxiety and (overt or suppressed) anger, are core constituents of the stress-syndrome. Thus, the 5-HT ergic disturbance will induce a heightened sensitivity for stressful events, ie, the latter will induce more readily than normal, stress phenomena , among which anxiety and anger. The latter psychological features induce lowering of mood and thus \"drive\" the patient into a fullblown depression. Furthermore it is predicted that anxiolytics and serenics (ie, anti-aggressive drugs) that act via normalisation of 5-HT ergic circuits, will exert a antidepressant effect in 5-HT related depression, in addition to their therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders and states of increased aggressiveness, respectively. The exact nature of the 5-HT ergic impairment in 5-HT related depression has yet to be elucidated.",

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan).

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "Depression: Everyone gets the blues now and then, but when there is little joy or pleasure after visiting with friends or after seeing a good movie, there may be a more serious problem. A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this depression.Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.Although there has been evidence for some time of a sex difference in depression, relatively little research has examined the developmental process by which women come to be at greater risk than men for depression. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.The sense of one's identity or self is an important dimension of individual's personality giving each one of us unique individuality. Women and depression is holding a relationship of much interest over the last two decades. As more and more women enter the work force, they are increasingly exposed not only of the same work environment as men, but also to unique pressure created by multiple roles and conflicting expectations (Nelson & Burke, 2000). It has long been observed that women are about twice as likely to become clinically depressed (to have dysthmia or unipolar depression) as are men. These differences occur in most countries around the world (Nolen - Hoeksemo & Girgus, 1994; Whilelm & Roy, 2003).Depression is normal features of our lives. Modernity brought women education in its wake and she changed the arena of activity. She stepped out of the threshold ofhouse and joined service like man. Now she got admiration, equality and opportunity. But the euphoria was ephemeral as she was supposed to take to this job as an additional responsibility. She not expected to shrink household work. This brought problems like strain and depression (Pillai & Sen, 1998).A women by nature is expressive emotional and sensitive. Physiological social and cultural background of women probably plays a key role in mending a women's attitude and natures towards the external relation we know that women are generally more at risk to develop psychological disorder and depression in particular.Objectives of the study* To find out effect of age on depression among working women.* To find out effect of experience on depression among working womenHypotheses of the study* There is significant variation in depression among employees based on age* There is significant variation in the depression among the employees based on their experience.MethodParticipantsThe study was conducted in Delhi and Gurgaon, India with a sample of 200 women professionals. The sample selection was done by a convenience sampling method. Age ranges from 20-60. Education was not included as the criteria for selection.InstrumentsBeck Depression Inventory (BDI): The depression scale was made by Beck ward, Mendesion, Moch and Drbauge (1961). It is comprised of twenty one items. Although the inventory was designed as a clinical instrument but in practice it is frequently used to dichotomies subjects in to depressed and non-depressed groups. This inventory has test-retest reliability coefficient ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 on different time intervals and positively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a person r of 0.71.The data collected were analyzed using descriptive one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation test.Results and discussionDistribution of depression based on age: Table 1 depicts the frequency of depression among employees based on age. …",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathogenetical Characterization of 238 Patients of a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Italian Center",
      "abstract": "SummaryProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms, then a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered.CFS probably is an heterogeneous disease, maybe multifactorial, or it includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. In some cases, the mode of presentation of the illness implicate the exposure to chemical and/or food toxins as precipitating factors (e.g., ciguatera poisoning, Gulf War Syndrome, etc.). In other CFS cases, the etiology is still unknown: there are various hypotheses on pathogenetic events which, alone or in association with each other, may precipitate the illness. In fact, it is probable an involvement of multiple events in CFS onset where different precipitating factors can interact each other, even if not always all present in the single patient: latent and/or chronic viral infections, immunologic and neuroendocrine dysfunctions, psychological, environmental and mood factors.In accordance to this theory, we consider various subgroups of CFS patients on the basis of the pathway and the mode of presentation of the disease. The Clinic of Infectious Diseases of \"G. D'Annunzio\" University of Chieti is one of the main National Reference Centers for the CFS Study in Italy. From January 1992 to January 1998, 238 patients came to our observation: 89 of them met CDC criteria for CFS (1994), 127 did not; the other 22 patients are still under evaluation. Our patients underwent physical examination (including tests for searching for the possible coexistence of a fibromyalgia syndrome), psychiatric interview with several neuropsychological tests, laboratory tests (including magnesium determination on serum), neuroendocrine evaluation (circadian rhythm of several hormones, buspirone challenge test), SPECT scans to evaluate cerebral perfusion, and other examinations where necessary in according to the symptomatology of each patient (e.g., orthopedic, ORL, EMG, muscle biopsy, etc.).According to our preliminary results, we subdivided our patients in different subgroups and we studied them comparatively.We report the more significant data collected from this evaluation that might lead to a better understanding of the syndrome and in particular of its pathways course, a knowledge that will help in choosing appropriate therapies for each subgroups.",

Seventy patients, 17 female and 53 male, aged between 39-77 years, mean age 61.2 +/- 9.9 years, were observed. The presence of both somatic (prolonged atherosclerotic lesion of coronary arteries) and mental (personality disorders with symptoms of reactive lability under psychic trauma influence) predisposition is obligate for manifestation or exacerbation of this IHD type. It is suggested that atherosclerotic coronary vessels affection of heterogeneity may exist. Two types of vulnerability are described. In type 1 cardiovascular system exhibits selective sensitivity to the influence of obligate and of great personality significance cathatymic affect. A strict condition of its realization is amplification of negative emotions up to a level of pathological affective outbursts in the spectrum of paranoiac or explosive reactions. In these cases, IHD is characterized by a stable course (angina of high tensions, without instable anginal episodes etc). In type 2 cardiovascular system reveals vulnerability to negative emotions, the continuum of which is ended by polar pathological affects-cathatymic and anxiety. In contrast to cathatymic affect, a common feature of anxiety affect is a fast, like short-term emotional outburst, manifestation of instable, labile, dramatic external appearances (with tears, converse disorders etc). IHD symptom complex is distinguished by pronounced clinical manifestations (stenocardia of tension with progressive impairment of tolerability to loadings).",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria",
      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 category of gender dysphoria replaces the former diagnosis of gender identity disorder, which was a controversial diagnosis in DSM-IV . DSM-5 has changed important criteria and no longer considers doubts about one's gender to constitute a mental disorder. Rather, gender dysphoria is solely concerned with the affective concerns and not the determination of the physical outcome. Psychological treatment for gender dysphoria will generally involve a team approach that incorporates psychotherapy along with medical treatment. Other specific gender dysphoria would be diagnosed when the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met even though symptoms cause significant functional impairment. Unspecified gender dysphoria refers to presentations in which the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met and there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis, or the clinician chooses not to specify the reason.",

It can be caused by an aberration of a body’s physiology, psychological factors, or a rather complicated interplay of both. Whereas current treatment options for ED are primarily focused on medical choices, a biopsychosocial approach is a more logical option for this often multifactorial condition. In this article, we offer information about erectile functioning, provide a DSM-IV-TR interpretation of ED, and discuss a biopsychosocial approach to ED treatment.",

Some interactions can be pharmacokinetic, principally by way of enzyme induction or enzyme inhibition, and than they lead to disturbances in the plasma levels of the active substances.

Often, such symptoms will represent primary neurologic or psychiatric syndromes, but clinicians must be aware that neuropsychiatric symptoms may also be secondary to other medical illnesses, medications, or metabolic abnormalities, and may present in varied and unusual ways. This article examines atypical neuropsychiatric symptoms that are secondary to medical or other causes. Our goal is to introduce the clinician to several causes of such symptoms, and to reinforce the principle that when neuropsychiatric symptoms emerge in the elderly, it is clinically imperative that a wide differential diagnosis be considered in symptom evaluation. Five cases are presented here that exemplify the evaluation of medication side effects, psychosis, movement disorders, depression, and anxiety in the elderly person.",

      "abstract": "Dyspepsia is a remarkably common symptom in the general population. Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by relapsing and remitting symptoms. Treatment strategies should focus on alleviating the most bothersome symptom and can be based on the proposed underlying pathophysiology. The effect of gender on mechanisms of disease, symptom presentation, and treatment response is an area of increasing interest and study. As with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, there appear to be some gender-specific features of functional dyspepsia. Specifically, gender-related differences have been observed in some studies of both the prevalence of individual dyspepsia symptoms, and in gastric emptying and proximal gastric motor function. There also appear to be gender differences in the psychosocial realm, with dyspeptic women experiencing a lesser sense of well-being than dyspeptic men, as well as an association of an abuse history with functional dyspepsia. This review will highlight specific gender differences related to the symptom presentation, pathophysiology, and approach to treatment of functional dyspepsia, while noting where differences have not been found and where further investigation is warranted.",

CS is found worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of 5.8% in the U.S. general population. The disorder occurs mainly in women, has an onset in the late teen years or early 20s, and appears to be chronic or recurrent. Subjects with CS are preoccupied with shopping, experience pre-purchase tension or anxiety, and have a sense of relief following a purchase. CS is associated with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders. The disorder tends to run in families with mood and substance use disorders. There are no standard approved treatments. Medication studies have produced mixed results, but cognitive behavioral treatment models appear promising.",

      "abstract": "A depressao e um dos mais prevalentes transtornos psiquiatricos, tendo como principais sintomas clinicos a anorexia, a reducao da atividade locomotora, a anedonia e a falta de concentracao. Ha evidencias de que alteracoes imunoinflamatorias estao subjacentes a depressao. Alem disso, o sexo e um fator relevante para a manifestacao de sintomas da depressao, embora evidencias mais recentes apontem para uma gravidade semelhante da depressao em ambos os sexos. O tratamento da depressao e pouco eficaz devido ao fato das medicacoes existentes nao atuarem nos diversos mecanismos fisiopatologicos deste transtorno. Nesse contexto, a combinacao de antidepressivos com diferentes mecanismos de acao e uma pratica comum em nao-respondedores ou respondedores parciais aos antidepressivos. Vale destacar que farmacos antidepressivos e antimicrobianos tem demonstrado propriedades anti-inflamatorias. Os objetivos do presente estudo foram: i) investigar a influencia do sexo nas alteracoes comportamentais e neuroinflamatorias/oxidativas no modelo animal de sintomas tipo depressao induzido por exposicao unica ao desafio imune por lipopolissacarideo (LPS) de Escherichia coli e ii) avaliar em animais machos submetidos a exposicao repetida ao LPS, os efeitos terapeuticos da doxiciclina e escitalopram sozinhos e em associacao. Para atingir os objetivos propostos o presente estudo se dividiu em dois protocolos. No primeiro protocolo, o modelo de depressao foi induzido pela exposicao sistemica e unica de camundongos Swiss machos e femeas ao lipopolissacarideo de E. coli (LPS – 0,5 mg/kg) e avaliacao apos 24 horas. No segundo protocolo, apenas animais machos foram submetidos a exposicao repetida de LPS por 10 dias sendo que apos 5 dias de exposicao ao LPS os animais receberam doxiciclina ou escitalopram sozinhos ou em associacao. Foram avaliadas alteracoes inflamatorias/oxidativas, bem como em vias de sinalizacao protetoras. O protocolo 1 mostrou que apenas animais machos apresentaram alteracōes comportamentais tipo-depressivo, como aumento de imobilidade do nado forcado e diminuicao na preferencia por sacarose. As femeas apresentaram comportamento ansiogenico no labirinto em cruz elevado. Tanto machos quanto femeas apresentaram alteracoes neuroinflamatorias e oxidativas. No protocolo 2, doxiciclina (DOXI - 10 mg/Kg) ou escitalopram (ESCI - 4 mg/kg) sozinhos ou em associacao reverteram o aumento de imobilidade induzido pela exposicao repetida ao LPS. Os niveis de IL-1β e TNF-α aumentaram apos exposicao LPS, enquanto DOXI e ESCI reverteram esses niveis. DOXI e o ESCI reverteram o aumento dos niveis de nitrito induzido por LPS. Os niveis de expressao proteica do fator nuclear kappa B (NF-B) e o marcador da molecula adaptadora de ligacao de calcio ionizada-1 (IBA-1) expresso na microglia ativada foram aumentados no grupo exposto ao LPS sendo revertidos pela DOXI e ESCI, enquanto que os niveis de glicogenio sintase quinase-3 (GSK3β) fosforilada e a proteina quinase regulada extracelular (ERK 1/2) fosforilada foram diminuidos no grupo do LPS e revertidos apos o protocolo de tratamento. A DOXI tambem aumentou os niveis proteicos da ERK 1/2 total e do fator transcripcional da proteina de ligacao ao elemento de resposta de AMPc (CREB). Com base nos resultados do presente estudo, a DOXI quando administrada sozinha ativou mais mecanismos neuroprotetores em comparacao ao ESCI, como aumento dos niveis cerebrais de GSH e CREB fosforilado, alem da combinacao das duas drogas ter reduzido os niveis de NF-B e aumentado GSK3β fosforilado. Portanto, sugere-se que a DOXI pode atuar como um antidepressivo, apresentando efeitos superiores aos observados com o escitalopram.",

Symptoms of depression can be manifestations of either dementing or medical illnesses, both of which are common in the elderly. Psychosocial factors that are unique to the elderly may be etiologic in the genesis of depressive symptoms, but nevertheless require the clinician to fully assess each patient and treat as appropriate. Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

      "abstract": "Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is a syndrome characterized by chronic pain and/or stiffness in the neck, shoulders or upper arms and hips. It affects adult patients usually over 50 years old and is treated with low-dose oral corticosteroids. In this case, a 68-year-old female with a history of PMR, diagnosed by a specialist sporadically seen in the past, presented to a primary care physician due to herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Thorough history taking, along with a careful review of previous laboratory results, raised serious doubts concerning her diagnosis (PMR). Because the patient described diffuse pain throughout her body, sleep disturbances and a depressed emotional state, fibromyalgia was suspected instead and appropriate treatment was given. The patient remained free of symptoms and corticosteroids for almost a year. Information from this case may help to point out that PMR is a disorder that can be easily confused with other chronic pain conditions with similar manifestations, especially when the initial diagnosis is sped up in terms of consultation depth and care continuity. Under certain circumstances, primary care can lead to improved clinical outcomes.",

      "title": "A Psychopathological Consideration on the Neurotic Depersonalization",
      "abstract": "The author has tried a life-historical analysis on thirty cases of neurotic depersonalization in regard to the psychogenesis. At the same time, the ego structure in these patients has been discussed.1) The ability of estimation of love in these patients was seriously twisted as they had been loved too much or too little in their infancy. The character features such as peculiar sensitiveness in interpersonal relationship, monopolistic tendency, strong need for might, self-assertion, selfishness, etc. were all attribuable to the various factors in their infantile life-history. In common to the neurotics, the frustration tolerance (especially for love) was also extremely faible and the socialization of personality was pretty insufficient in these patients. This fact means the elevated susceptibility to affective frustrations in the future.2) The depersonalization appears always after the intense inner tension for certain period, which signifies the consumption of psychological force ( Janet). The abrupt abasement of psychological tension is motivated by the sudden affective deprivation or by the strong menaces to or the sudden interruption of the tendency of self-enlargement in such circumstances. The depersonalization is caused by the reduction of the secondary action ( Janet) which is brought about by the abasement of psychological tension. At the same time, the state completely narcissistic would develop in such conditions just mentioned. On the contrary, the displacement of these motives and the resolution of the inner tension will play an important role in the disparition of the depersonalization symptoms.3) Last of all, the depersonalization begins, according to Federn, whenever the outer ego-boundary becomes weak and consequently the egotized data concerned lose the energy cathexes. This weakening of the outer ego-boundary results, in my opinion, from the ego weakness which is attribuable to constitutional factors in one hand and to the intense inner tension for certain period on the other. In the psychogenesis of depersonalization, Federn emphasized the mechanism of projection of this primary ego disturbance to the outer objects. From the psychoanlytic point of view, the reduction of libido and mortido components in the ego cathexes to objects is the result of the relative increase of medial ego cathexes, which is the most primitive form of ego libido (Federn), caused by the lifehistorically developped narcissism. The organs and the functions to which libido is mostly invested in healthy state are influenced most seriously in the deprsonalized patients. Finally, it is relatively strengthened by the weakening of tile inner ego-boundary.",

These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck. Again, the anatomical or morphological terms are equal, but the mechanism is different. During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

Studies in the literature have reported several causes and mechanisms of injuries. Links between injuries and previous comorbidities have emerged from the extant literature; obesity and/or metabolic disorders, seizures (associated with overstimulation of the eyes), heart malfunctions, high basal and abrupt increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), prolonged stress, and poor posture have been associated with injuries. Several clinical signs have been identified and the question emerges whether or not self-regulation by Esports associations or public health authorities is necessary.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

Answering ‘yes’ may indicate that you are just experiencing normal concern about the usual tribulations oflife. Alternatively, your worrying may be an indicator that you have a mental disorder. Establishing whether worrying is a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, or merely a normal experience, requires answers to a number of supplementary questions such as ‘What’s it like when you worry?’ ‘Can you turn your attention to anything else?’ and ‘How much of the time over the past month have you worried?’ When worrying becomes a recurrent and painful round of thoughts, so that it is difficult to turn your attention to anything else and takes up much of your time, then your worrying is more likely to be a symptom of a mental disorder (Wing et al. 1974).",

      "abstract": "Актуальність. Сепсис, як реакція організму на інфекцію, включає такий етап розвитку, як синдром поліорганної недостатності (СПОН). Мозкова дисфункція в 70 % випадків є одним з перших симптомів сепсис-асоційованого СПОН, ще до клінічних проявів в інших системах життєзабезпечення. Сепсис-асоційована енцефалопатія — мультифокальне порушення функцій головного мозку за умови наявності інфекції, що супроводжується проявами системного запалення, але без клінічних і лабораторних доказів прямої причетності інфекції до пошкодження головного мозку. Залежно від критеріїв, покладених в основу діагностики, церебральна дисфункція-недостатність може бути виявлена в усіх хворих із сепсисом. Ступінь її вираженості корелює зі зростанням тяжкості септичного процесу. Сепсис-асоційована дисфункція-недостатність може бути незалежним предиктором летального кінця. Тяжкість церебральної дисфункції-недостатності коливається від летаргії і/або дезорієнтації до коми. Мета: вивчення впливу терапії відповідно до головних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» із додатковою нейропротекцією Гліатиліном на перебіг септичного процесу й вираженість енцефалопатії в структурі синдрому поліорганної недостатності. Матеріали та методи. За період 2010–2015 рр. нами проведено контрольоване проспективне рандомізоване когортне дослідження на клінічній базі кафедри анестезіології та інтенсивної терапії ДЗ «Дніпропетровська медична академія МОЗ України» і на базі відділення інтенсивної терапії сепсису КП «Дніпропетровська обласна клінічна лікарня ім. І.І. Мечникова» ДОР». У дослідження було включено 22 пацієнти. У всіх хворих було проведено рутинні лабораторні дослідження для визначення рівня клінічних і біохімічних маркерів системного запалення й органних дисфункцій за шкалами SOFA і LIFE. Для оцінки стану свідомості використовували шкалу коми Глазго. Концентрацію цитокінів (фактор некрозу пухлини α, інтерлейкін-1, інтерлейкін-4, інтерферон α) у сироватці крові вивчали імуноферментним методом. Базисна інтенсивна терапія здійснювалася відповідно до основних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» з додатковим використанням нейропротекторного препарату Гліатиліну (холіну альфосцерат) 1000–3000 мг на добу внутрішньовенно, розчиненого в 0,9% розчині натрію хлориду, протягом 5–10 днів. Дослідження показників проводилося в чотири етапи: на 1-шу, 3-тю, 5-ту, 7-му добу. Результати. Узагальнюючи результати дослідження, можливо сказати, що на п’яту й сьому добу були відсутні клінічні прояви синдрому системної запальної відповіді в понад 75 % хворих; зменшилася тяжкість стану за APACHE II на 72,5 і 74,5 % (p &lt; 0,001) і ступінь вираженості синдрому поліорганної недостатності за SOFA в 9 разів (p &lt; 0,001) відповідно до етапів дослідження. Церебральна недостатність, оцінена за шкалою коми Глазго, становила 15 балів на п’яту й сьому добу дослідження, що відповідало стану ясної свідомості в понад 75 % хворих. Зазначене спостерігалося на тлі тенденції до збалансованості активності прозапальних і протизапальних ланок цитокінової системи, про що свідчили максимальні значення фактора некрозу пухлини α та інтерферону α на п’яту добу спостереження при зниженні концентрації інтерлейкіну-1 на 55,8 % щодо фону. Прогнозована летальність у пацієнтів другої групи становила 51 %, фактична летальність — 7,5 %. Отже, шляхом проведення даного варіанта інтенсивної терапії вдалося знизити передбачувану летальність на 43,5 %.",

      "title": "AB54. Pathophysiology of premature ejaculation and serotonin",
      "abstract": "According to the epidemiologic studies conducted so far, premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction in younger men (<30 years); its prevalence is higher than that of ED, and varies from 9% and up to 31% of the male population. The etiology of PE is uncertain in almost all cases, and might include a combination of organic and psychogenic factors. Negative conditioning and penile hypersensitivity are the most frequently cited etiological factors in PE, although neither mechanism has received adequate experimental support to date. Accordingly from a scientific perspective, it is fair to state that PE pathophysiology is largely unknown.\r\n\r\nSerotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Biochemically derived from tryptophan, serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), platelets, and the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, including humans. It is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness. There are currently 15 known 5-HT receptor subtypes, which are grouped into seven major classes (5-HT1–7). With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, all 5-HT receptors are coupled to second messengers by G proteins. All 5-HT receptors have been reported to exist postsynaptically. Although some authors have suggested the existence of facilitatory 5-HT3 autoreceptors, only the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B) are widely accepted to function as presynaptic autoreceptors. At least three of the 5-HT receptor subtypes have a role in ejaculation: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors. Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2C or 5-HT1B receptors prolongs ejaculatory latency, whereas activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which inhibits 5-HT release, decreases ejaculatory latency. Subcutaneous administration of the 5-HT1B receptor agonists anpirtoline and m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine and systemic, acute administration of the 5-HT2C agonist 2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine have been shown to impair ejaculation in rats. Based on the role of 5-HT neurotransmission in the physiology of ejaculatory control and possibly in the pathogenesis of PE, and because SSRI antidepressants have the well-established side-effect of delaying ejaculation when used to treat depressed patients, currently marketed SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline, which increase synaptic 5-HT concentration via blockade of 5-HT transporters, have been investigated in numerous clinical studies for managing PE. Paroxetine and sertraline have provided significant benefits in patients with PE, either via daily administration or on-demand use before intercourse, and fluoxetine has shown some efficacy for PE as continuously dosed therapy. Although none of these agents has received an indication for the treatment of PE, current guidelines from the AUA and recommendations from the Second International Consultation on Sexual Dysfunctions recommend the off-label use of SSRIs for managing PE.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations.

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "title": "Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Two hundred and thirty‐nine cases of status epilepticus in children 0–15 years old have been studied. Generalized tonic‐clonic and unilateral clonic convulsions constituted the bulk of cases. Status is mostly observed in young infants since 37% of all cases occurred in the first year, 73% in the first 3 years and 85% before 5 years of age. In only 23% of the patients did brief convulsions precede the episode of status epilepticus. Conversely seizures were noticed after status in almost three quarters of patients followed for one year or more. One half of our cases were apparently due to organic brain damage, either acute or chronic, the remaining half had no recognized etiological factors. More than half of these cryptogenic cases were related to non‐specific febrile episodes. The prognosis of children's status epilepticus is grave, mental or neurological residua or both being present in at least 57% of our patients. Approximately one half of these children had had normal development prior to their bout of convulsions. Gross brain damage was the main cause of status below 6 months of age, whereas cryptogenic convulsions predominated during the second year. Most of these cases were associated with fever. It is suggested that status epilepticus is capable of causing brain damage whatever its cause and that many cryptogenic episodes of febrile status are but the most severe cases in the spectrum of febrile convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Deux cents trente‐neuf cas d'état de mal épileptique chez l'enfant de 0–15 ans ont étéétudiées. Les crises généralisées tonico‐cloniques et les crises cloniques unilatérales sont la majorité. L'état de mal est surtout fréquent chez l'enfant jeune, 37% des cas survenant dans la premiére année, 73% avant trois ans et 85% avant cinq ans. L'état de mal n'a été précédé de convulsions courtes que dans 23% des cas. A l'inverse des crises aprés l'état de mal ont ete notées chez prés de trois quarts des malades suivis un an ou plus. La moitié de nos cas semble due à une atteinte cérebrale organique, aigüe ou chronique, l'autre moitié de ces états n'ayant pas de cause reconnue. Plus de la moitié de ces états de mal cryptogenétiqués étaient en relation avec des infections banales n'intéressant pas primitivement le cerveau. Le pronostic de l'état de mal épileptique de l'enfant est grave, puisque des séquelles mentales ou neurologiques étaient présentes chez 57% de nos enfants. Chez à peu prés la moitié de ceux‐ci le développement neuro‐psychique avait été normal jusqu'à l'état de mal. Avant l'âge de 6 mois les lésions organiques sont la cause commune des états de mal alors que les formes idiopathiques sont prédominates dans la seconde anneé, le plus souvent en association avec de la fiévre. l'état de mal épileptique semble capable á lui seul de créer des lésions cérébrates définitives quelle que soit sa cause. Nombre d'états de mal fébriles ne seraient que la forme extrême des convulsions fébriles.",

      "title": "Introduction and overview of offenders with intellectual disabilities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Intellectual disability (according to the DSM-5) or intellectual developmental disorder (according to the ICD-11) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social and practical domains. The term learning disability (LD) is also used, although this term shows more specifically deficits in the domain of learning. The term learning difficulties is often used for specific or generalized intellectual impairment that does not meet all of the criteria of LD. The prevalence of learning disability in prisoners is about 10%. Up to 60% of male prisoners have learning difficulties. Prevalence rates for offending behaviour in patients with LD is higher than in the general population and show a large range, from 2-40%. The main explanatory factor underlying the link between intelligence and offending is the lack of ability to manipulate abstract concepts. Poor academic performance, common in persons with LD, is also linked to offending. With regard to sexual offending, some persons with LD may not have learnt the rules that define acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Sexual offences may amount to inappropriate, impulsive expressions of emotion rather than premediated violent acts. Violent behaviour in the LD population may be due to frustration, impulsivity or poor problem solving skills. There is no significant difference in the frequency of violent or property offences between individuals with LD and those without. However, sex offences and fire-setting are frequently seen in individuals with LD. Persons with LD are vulnerable suspects and may also be disadvantaged by the criminal justice system because of a lack of appropriate support and legal representation from early stages in the process. In this introductory paper these themes will be addressed. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

While presentation of late-onset, post-service difficulties may explain some of the difference between veterans and those in service, delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be partly explained by prior subthreshold PTSD, as well as other mental health difficulties. In the longer term, veterans do not appear to suffer worse mental health than equivalent civilians. This overall lack of difference, despite increased mental health difficulties in those who have recently left, suggests that veterans are not at risk of worse mental health and/or that poor mental health is a cause, rather than a consequence, of leaving service.",

      "abstract": "Healthy female sexual functioning is driven by sexual desire. Sexual desire, traditionally defined as sexual thoughts and fantasies, is a natural life force and an art form affecting all aspects of a woman’s interpersonal and professional life. Virtually, all diagnostic categories of female sexual dysfunction, including arousal disorder, anorgasmia, and sexual pain disorder are linked to, caused by, or aggravated by loss of sexual desire. Decreased sexual desire is a diagnosis (hypoactive sexual desire disorder, HSDD) with its own International Classification of Diseases code (F52.0).. Impact is often subtle. HSDD may express as seemingly unrelated emotional disturbances that degrade life quality in family relationships, in the workplace, or both. For some women, it is severely distracting. The diagnosis of HSDD is made when symptoms are sufficient to cause distress. In older women, HSDD is heavily impacted by menopause-associated withdrawal of reproductive hormones, particularly testosterone and estradiol. HSDD greatly improves with transdermal replacement of these steroids. Side effects of transdermal hormones are minimal but response can be gratifying. In premenopausal women, HSDD behaves more as a psychoendocrine disorder that is responsive in some patients to flibanserin, a nonhormonal 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Side effects of flibanserin are significant but manageable. This review contains 12 figures, 6 tables, and references. Key Words: estradiol, flibanserin, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, menopause, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sexual desire, sexuality, testosterone, transdermal, women",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of postcovid depression. The main diagnostic criteria and symptoms of depressive disorder are outlined. It is indicated that the basic symptoms include: depressed mood, loss of curiosity and pleasure from daily activities, increased fatigue, loss of energy and decreased activity. The risk factors that most influence the formation of depressive disorders are analyzed. These factors include: job loss, divorce, loss of relatives, high levels of personal anxiety, and stressful life events. The main goal of therapy in patients with VDR is complete functional recovery and return to the premorbid state. The difficulty of treating depressive disorders lies in the lack of complete recovery in the case of severe or complicated forms of depressive disorders. The author identifies the main emotional and cognitive signs of depressive disorder, namely: low or increased mood, feelings of anxiety and unreasonable anxiety, irritability or manifestations of anger towards yourself or other people, repeated negative thoughts about yourself, about drug addicts and the future, reduced concentration of attention, apathy, inattention. Recovery from depression is not the absence of negative affective symptoms, but the restoration of normal emotional functioning, the ability to be yourself and experience positive emotions. The goal of psychotherapy for depression is to change the patient's negative thoughts, emotional state and mood.",

      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "title": "Genetic Disorders Involving Adrenal Development",
      "abstract": "The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of the genetic aetiology of several forms of adrenal failure that present in infancy or childhood. Several of these disorders affect adrenal development and are termed 'adrenal hypoplasia'. These conditions can be broadly divided into: (1) secondary forms of adrenal hypoplasia due to panhypopituitarism (e.g. HESX1, LHX4, SOX3) or abnormalities in ACTH synthesis (TPIT) or processing (e.g. POMC or PC1); (2) adrenal hypoplasia as part of an ACTH resistance syndrome [MC2R/ACTH receptor, MRAP, AAAS (triple A syndrome)], and (3) primary defects in the development of the adrenal gland itself (primary adrenal hypoplasia). Primary adrenal hypoplasia most commonly occurs in an X-linked form due to mutations in the nuclear receptor DAX1 (NR0B1) but can occur in a poorly understood recessive form or as part of the IMAGe (intrauterine growth retardation, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia, genitourinary anomalies) syndrome. Defining the molecular basis of these conditions can have significant clinical implications for management, counselling and presymptomatic diagnosis, as well as providing fascinating insight into normal and abnormal mechanisms of adrenal development in humans.",

      "title": "Fatigue et qualité de vie chez les patients cancéreux.",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "The importance of psychogenic factors in the development of a variety of dermatological diseases have been debated by many authors. The prominent role of autoimmunity, psychological and emotional factors are emphasized as contributing to the expression of vitiligo which can be viewed as a psychocutaneous disorder. The skin has a great psychosocial impact as an erogenic region all through life. In this article two cases of vitiligo in which sexual trauma has a precipitating role are presented and the clinical manifestations and stressor factors are discussed. Sexual trauma involves any kind of activity correlated with sexual desire without the consensus of the individual. Besides the negative effects associated with the disfiguring features of vitiligo, emotions like shame, rage due to sexual assaults have been deeply experienced in both of the cases. Negative emotions which have not been totally released with the occurence of vitiligo, lead to dysthymic disorder in the first case and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in the second one.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

Patients with this disorder have always been present in medical settings, but have been described as \"difficult patients\" rather than patients with borderline personality disorder.

Suggestive behaviors in the medical setting may include aggressive or disruptive behaviors, the intentional sabotage of medical care, and excessive healthcare utilization. Suggestive medical syndromes and diagnoses in the medical setting may include alcohol and substance misuse (including the abuse of prescription medications), multiple somatic complaints, chronic pain, obesity, sexual impulsivity, and hair pulling.

      "title": "Tackling anxiety and depression in older people in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and does not evaluate symptom severity.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic reactions in the context of meditation and esoteric practices have been described in the psychiatric literature. In most cases, these psychotic conditions are transient and do not lead to functional impairment. The authors present the case of a 46-year-old woman who had worked as a spiritual healer for several years and, in the course of this occupation, increasingly developed a highly specific configuration of psychotic symptoms (all of which could be convincingly traced back to the formerly used spiritual techniques) along with depressive symptoms and severe functional impairment. The differential diagnosis was initially complicated by the relative conformity of the patient’s psychotic symptoms with her occupational practices and the absence of other, more typical, symptoms of schizophrenia. Only a thorough anamnesis with another spiritual healer and precise identification of psychopathology helped to disentangle the merely uncommon from the pathologic features of this case. Possible mechanisms of psychotogenesis are discussed in light of the literature and the specific features of the presented case. Although a single case report cannot prove a causal link between spiritual healing and development of psychosis, the patient’s specific psychopathology, with preeminently disturbed self-experience, and its consistency with the patient’s spiritual practices suggest at least a contributory role in this case.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age worldwide, along with painful menstruation and genital inflammation. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája világszerte a fájdalmas menstruáció és a nemi szervi gyulladások mellett.

A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS súlyos formája a pszichiátriában diagnosztizált és kezelt premenstruális dysphoriás zavar (PMDD). A multifaktoriális kóreredetű PMS megjelenését és súlyosságát a hypothalamus–hypophysis–ovarium tengely ciklikus működésének hatására kialakuló pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok indítják el, megváltoztatva az agy neurotranszmitter- vagy neuropeptid-funkcióit, például a szerotoninerg rendszer működését. A pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok hozzájárulnak a fizikai, a pszichológiai és a viselkedésbeli tünetek kialakulásához, melyeket befolyásol még az egyéb fiziológiai (például genetikai háttér, metabolikus és krónikus gyulladásos folyamatok, kronobiológiai és cirkadián működészavarok), illetve pszichikai stresszorok együttes jelenléte, illetve azok egymásra való kölcsönhatása is.

The first patient showed ictal aphasia and occasional right hemiparesis during these episodes, and partial left frontal lobectomy resulted in temporary freedom from seizures. The classification of these ictal episodes is difficult. They apparently fall into the category of absence status (petit mal status), but the focal neurological signs do not fit the presently valid definitions of absence status, nor does the lack of symmetrical bilateral-synchronous paroxysmal discharges. Perhaps a special category of status epilepticus should be established.",

      "title": "Non-essential symptoms of depression and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) in community-dwelling elders without dysphoria or anhedonia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

Chronic pelvic pain can be visceral, somatic, neuropathic, or a combination. Patients with CPP often suffer from concurrent bowel or bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety. The complexity of chronic pelvic pain can be challenging to treat, which can lead to frustration for both patients and their physicians. Treatment should involve a comprehensive and multi-modal approach involving psychosocial support, counseling, physical therapy, medication management, and interventional procedures.

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

      "abstract": "We report two cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), comparing the clinical and laboratory features of these predominant neurological patients and reporting their different outcome. NMO - a severe demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system - primarily affects the spinal cord and optic nerves, resulting in longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. Our patients had a late pSS diagnosis, due to the absence of sicca syndrome and specific Sjögren serology in the early stages of their diseases, when the neurological symptoms prevailed. Many NMO patients have an accompanying autoimmune disease, most commonly Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus or a related profile of non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pSS, usually preceding the diagnosis (in 75-80% of the cases) [1,2]. The frequency of both neurologic manifestations (revealing pSS) and negative autoimmune serology, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why underlying pSS is misdiagnosed [3,4]. Screening for pSS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy and/or cranial nerve involvement, mainly because these patients have a severe outcome. The presence of the anti-aquaporin4 antibodies, besides anti-Ro and anti-La, in both reported cases, is intriguing and raises the question of whether we are facing two distinct diseases or the NMO is just complicating an unusually less expressive Sjögren's syndrome subtype.",

      "title": "Prolonged Stress Leads to Serious Health Problems: Preventive Approaches.",
      "abstract": "Â  Â  Â As long as humans have been around, there has been stress. Stress is well known fact involved significantly in the onset of almost all major depressive disorders. Moreover, prolonged stress in humans caused serious neurological disorders, cardiac problems (including heart attack), gastric ulcers, asthma, diabetes, headaches, accelerated aging and premature death. (1-4) Stress is basically of two types: Acute and chronic stress, which has also been well defined in animal models. (5-8) Acute stress results from specific events or situations that involve novelty, a threat to ego which leave the people in a poor sense of control. Importantly, sometimes this stress can be good also as it keeps individuals alert, motivated and primed to respond. This happens due to the release of stress-induced hormones, which help the individuals to deal with the situation. (6,7) On the other hand chronic stress, which can be occurred by repeated exposure of the situation. This stress has been linked to major neurological disorders, heart diseases, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes etc. Now it is well documented that up to 70% of serious diseased populations are believed to be effected by chronic stress. (1-4) Therefore, proper chronic stress management takes on great importance given the wide range of bodily systems impacted by stress hormones. The response against stress involves a complex signaling pathway among neurons and somatic cells. (9,10) Besides these, stress also exerts detrimental effects on cell functions through impairment of oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis leading to oxidative cellular damage and altering monoaminergic response, which play critical role in almost 80% of human disorders including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. (9-14) While understanding of the chemical interactions underlying the stress response has increased vastly in recent years, much remains poorly understood. In response to chronic stress, two types of responses are reported, physiological and psychological, which are mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathoadrenergic and brain monoaminergic systems, that subsequently leads to behavioral, physiological and neurobiological changes. (9-14) Moreover duration and nature of an applied stressor are also important determinants to know whether adaptation to the stress response acts as being protective or damaging. (15) Direct intervention on neurotransmitters might be beneficial as augmentation strategies for the treatment of stress-induced disorders. But various preliminary stress coping strategies should be followed to avoid becoming a depression patient. The research area focuses on improved understanding of how stress-related illnesses and health problems arise and can be prevented in and outside of the workplace. (15, 16) Despite a wide range of strategies and different categorizations for anti-stress approaches, two main categorizations are mentioned almost universally: Coping Response to Emotion (or Emotion Focused Coping) and Coping Response to Problems (or Problem Focused Coping). (15, 16) Coping Response to Emotion can be achieved by performing the following well defined approaches: (i) Trying to reduce the negative emotional responses associated with stress such as embarrassment, fear, anxiety, depression, excitement and frustration. (ii) Keeping busy to take the mind off from the issue. (iii) Emotional disclosure, which involves expressing strong emotions by talking or writing about negative events. (iv) Cognitive reappraisal, it involves the cognitive modulations to construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact. (v) Stop thinking of negative thoughts. (vi) Praying for guidance and strength. (v) Meditation, (vi) Eating good food, (vii) Shopping, (viii) Drugs intake. (15) On the other hand â€˜Coping Response to Problemsâ€™ can be achieved by targeting the causes of stress in a practical ways such as (i) By stepping back, (ii) Looking at the situation objectively, (iii) Without letting emotion get in the way, (iv) Begin to understand the source of the stress. (15,16) Â Â Â Â  In my opinion, both coping approaches are effective in the specific circumstances. When choosing an effective coping strategy, one must take into account the changeability of the stressor, the individualâ€™s reaction to the stressor, and the adaptability of the individualâ€™s capacity through changeable physiological responses. In short, providing individuals with appropriate adaptive coping skills can reduce negative health outcomes and increase the ability to manage ongoing stress. The good news is that stress levels depends on our own behavior and decisions and that we can optimize our bodiesâ€™ responses to stress based on how we live our daily lives.",

      "abstract": "Adrenal incidentaloma (AI) includes all lesions with diameter ≥ 1 cm found incidentally during imaging examinations not associated with suspected adrenal pathology. Every adrenal incidentaloma requires a detailed hormonal and imaging assessment. Initial diagnosis includes radiological phenotypical evaluation (particularly in CT, or in case of contraindications — in MRI) and biochemical assessment of tumour hormonal activity (which includes cortisol circadian rhythm, salivary cortisol concentration, 24-hour urinary free-cortisol and metanephrines test, short cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test, ACTH level assessment, aldosterone and ARO concentration, adrenal androgen concentration). Each diagnostic step is associated with limitations and method imperfections. The influence of administered medications, age and concomitant diseases must be taken into account when interpreting test results. It is important to remember abovementioned factors may cause false positive or false negative test results. The following paper is to summarize the etiology of the most common diagnostic mishaps which frequently lead to misdiagnoses, an increase in patient's anxiety and, as a consequence, in the introduction of improper therapy or its discontinuation. The awareness of biochemical and imaging test limitations, and the knowledge of false positive and false negative result sources, allows for the optimisation of the diagnostic process. Simultaneously, the analyzed factors may contribute to a decrease in unnecessary and frequently repeated tests. Additionally, it may imply avoiding the costs of unjustified deep diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "La comorbidité psychiatrique est la règle plutôt que l’exception dans le cadre de la dépression majeure. 60 à 70 % des patients déprimés présentent au moins une comorbidité psychiatrique, et 30 à 40 % en ont au moins deux. Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment retrouvées sont les pathologies anxieuses, les addictions, et certains troubles ou traits de personnalité (borderline, neuroticisme) [1]. La présence de telles comorbidités compromet le pronostic de la maladie dépressive, avec une diminution des taux de rémission et de réponse aux traitements, un allongement du délai d’action, un tableau clinique plus sévère, une altération du fonctionnement et une chronicisation. Les comorbidités psychiatriques sont considérées comme un des facteurs participant à la résistance thérapeutique pour 20 à 30 % des épisodes [2]. Cette absence de réponse pourrait être plus particulièrement associée à certains sous-types et phénotypes cliniques de dépression poussant alors à la recherche de biomarqueurs spécifiques (électrophysiologiques, anatomiques et fonctionnels, métaboliques, et génétiques) de chacune de ces formes cliniques afin d’améliorer la compréhension même de la pathologie et son pronostic [3]. Par ailleurs, les recommandations ne définissent pas de stratégies précises en cas de dépressions avec comorbidités psychiatriques, les études randomisées, contrôlées classiquement menées ayant généralement tendance à exclure ces patients, et notamment ceux présentant une addiction associée. Il est néanmoins possible que le traitement de la dépression puisse améliorer le trouble comorbide, comme en témoigne la place aujourd’hui occupée par les antidépresseurs dans la pharmacothérapie des troubles anxieux [4]. Ces données soulèvent des questions cliniques, thérapeutiques et de recherche importantes, centrées sur une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque de la résistance en abordant le problème central de la comorbidité psychiatrique qu’il est essentiel de repérer dans le cadre d’une prise en charge globale du patient déprimé.",

Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

MSA is an α-synucleinopathy with specific glioneuronal degeneration involving striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic nervous systems but also other parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems[3]. Clinical manifestations include hypotension, urinary retention, constipation, ataxia, parkinsonism, and postural instability. Multiple system atrophy affects both men and women equally, the first symptoms usually appear after age 53. The etiology of this pathology is unknown, but is associated with the accumulation of bodies containing alpha-synuclein in different parts of the brain[1]. There are two types of MSA. The first type occurs with a predominance of cerebellar dysfunctions: ataxia, postural instability. In the clinical setting of the second type of MSA, symptoms of parkinsonism predominate, such as muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, postural disturbances, non-resting tremor and dysarthria. Also, both types exhibit autonomic disorders. The prognosis for this pathology is unfavorable; after the first symptoms appear, life expectancy is 9-10 years.",

      "title": "Qualitat de vida, adaptació social i estrès en joves amb un primer episodi psicòtic o en risc de psicosi",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIO:\nLa qualitat de vida i el funcionament social han esdevingut bons indicadors per mesurar la millora clinica dels trastorns psicotics, i han estat ampliament estudiats en persones amb esquizofrenia. En les primeres fases de la psicosi el funcionament psicosocial i la qualitat de vida romanen sovint deteriorades fins i tot despres de la remissio dels simptomes psicotics, afectant als resultats a llarg termini de la malaltia. Es frequent tambe que aquest pitjor funcionament estigui present abans de l’aparicio del primer episodi psicotic (PEP), en la coneguda fase prodromica, fase caracteristica dels subjectes coneguts com Estats Mentals d’Alt Risc (EMAR). Per altra banda, el paper de l’estres en l’aparicio d’un trastorn psicotic ha estat objecte d’estudi i ha estat conceptualitzat en el que es coneix com el model de vulnerabilitat-estres per explicar l’etiopatogenesi de l’esquizofrenia: persones amb una predisposicio genetica a la malaltia la desenvoluparan o no en funcio de la relacio amb l’ambient i els successos que esdevinguin al llarg de la seva vida. L’estres pero, tambe ha estat estudiat en altre vessants i processos que afecten l’evolucio de la malaltia, com per exemple en que l’us d’estrategies d’afrontament negatives davant l’estres implica l’empitjorament de la qualitat de vida en pacients amb psicosi, o tambe en el fet que pacients amb psicosi sense ocupacio laboral refereixen majors nivells d’estres que els que treballen, essent la ocupacio laboral un element intimament relacionat amb la qualitat de vida en persones amb psicosi. Alguns elements d’estres clarament identificats dins dels anomentats aconteixements vitals estressats, com ara el maltractament infantil, tambe s’ han associat a una pitjor adaptacio premorbida en pacients que han debutat amb alguna malaltia psicotica. OBJECTIUS:\nL’objectiu principal de l’estudi va ser explorar la relacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social en joves amb una psicosis incipient i investigar-ne els possibles efectes mediadors de les mesures d’estres. Per altra banda es pretenia analitzar la correlacio entre el maltractament infantil, com a esdeveniment estressant major, i l’adaptacio social.\n METODOLOGIA:\nAquesta tesi doctoral consta de tres treballs. El primer es un estudi analitic observacional i transversal on es van comparar les mesures d’estres i de qualitat de vida entre un grup de pacients considerats EMAR atesos en el servei de l’Equip d’Intervencio Precoc i un grup de quaranta controls sans. Posteriorment es va estratificar el grup de joves EMAR en funcio de l’adaptacio social que presentaven (baixa o normal segons puntuacions en l’escala d’adaptacio social SASS) i es va analitzar la qualitat de vida en base a aquesta estratificacio. Per ultim es va realitzar un analisi de mediacio per explorar si les mesures d’estres intervenien en la relacio entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida.\nEl segon, es un estudi observacional i prospectiu on es va mesurar la qualitat de vida, l’adaptacio social i les mesures d’estres de forma basal i a l’any posterior a la presentacio d’un PEP. L’evolucio de la qualitat de vida es va analitzar en funcio de les puntuacions en l’adaptacio social. Paral·lelament es van comaprar els resultats basals del grup de joves amb un PEP amb un grup de cinquanta-cinc controls sans i tambe es va mesurar l’efecte de mediacio de l’estres entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida en aquest grup d’estudi. \nEl tercer es tracta d’un estudi analitic observacional i transversal, on es va analitzar la relacio del maltractament infantil amb l’adaptacio social en totes les seves dimensions, d’un grup de joves amb una psicosi incipient utilitzant un model d’equacions estructurals, que permet un analisis multivariant de diferents subconjunts de variables, a l’hora que permet analitzar la relacio causal de variables de diferents grups.\n RESULTATS:\nEstudi 1.\nEls pacients EMAR van reportar taxes d’ocupacio laboral mes baixes, mes estres, pitjor qualitat de vida i menor adaptacio social que els controls sans. La qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social es van associar a les mesures d’estres. Els subjectes EMAR amb baixa adaptacio social van reportar mes estres percebut i pitjor qualitat de vida que els EMAR amb adaptacio social normal i que els controls sans. L’estres percebut va intervenir explicant la relacio que s’estableix entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida. \nEstudi 2. \nEls pacients van reportar una pitjor qualitat de vida, una pitjor adaptacio social i mes estres que els controls sans. Els pacients amb un PEP van millorar significativament la qualitat de vida i les mesures d’estres al llarg de l’any de seguiment, pero no l’adaptacio social. L’estres percebut va mediar l’associacio entre una pitjor adaptacio social i una qualitat de vida inferior. \nEstudi 3. \nEls EMAR van presentar mes negligencia emocional i pitjor adaptacio social comparats amb els PEP. El Model d'Equacions Estructurals (MEE) emprat va mostrar que el maltractament s’associa a una pitjor adaptacio social, principalment en dominis que impliquen relacions interpersonals. Quan els simptomes depressius fan de mediadors, es a dir, que expliquen com es la relacio que s’estableix entre el maltractament i l’adaptacio social, tambe es veuen afectats els dominis d’oci i treball i interessos socio-culturals. CONCLUSIONS:\nL’adaptacio social es menor en els subjectes EMAR que en subjectes sans. Aquesta te un impacte negatiu sobre la qualitat de vida dels joves EMAR. L’associacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social esta influenciada per l’estres percebut.\nEn el cas dels joves amb un PEP, l’adaptacio social a l’inici pot determinar la qualitat de vida durant el periode d’un any posterior a l’inici de la malaltia. Malgrat la millora en la majoria de mesures estudiades en l’any posterior al PEP, els pacients no aconsegueixen el mateix nivell de qualitat de vida que els del grup sense patologia. \nPer ultim, els antecedents de maltractament infantil influeixen negativament en l’adaptacio social de joves amb una psicosi incipient.",

FPE (F23) defines the shortest (up to 3 months) prodromal period, the presence in the clinical picture of excitement and anxiety of a high and moderate level, disorganization and physical tension. FPE (F25) is characterized by a rather long prodrome (from 3 months) with manifestations in the form of emotional disorders, the presence in the clinical picture of pronounced symptoms of excitement, depression, anxiety, physical tension and impulsivity, negative symptoms in the form of apatho-abolic manifestations and anhedonia - asociality. According to indicators of the dynamics of the condition of patients with FPE, an unfavorable prognosis for recovery at F20 was determined.",

Case: The frequency of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) occurrence among patients suffering from schizophrenia is considerably higher in comparison to general population. The results of some studies show that schizo-obsessive disorder is characterized by higher intensity of negative and depressive symptoms. Patients with comorbid schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder show greater level of social dysfunction and they exhibit suicidal behaviours more often than patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. We present a 33-year-old female with obsessive-compulsive symptoms with onset in her early teens with no satisfactory response to treatment, in spite of her good intellect and insight into illness and cooperation. Comment: There is some evidence suggesting that patients with “schizo-obsessive disorder” have a worse prognosis compared to the group of patients suffering only from schizophrenia, but the effect of OCD on schizophrenia symptom profile is unclear.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the distinction between positive and negative symptoms has reached a peak in the last decade and has led to research in different fields; like phenomenology, ethiopathogenesis, treatment, course and outcome. Which symptoms are considered positive or negative varies across different authors, although there seems to be agreement on a core syndrome. The definition problems can be also found in the rating scales used for measuring positive and negative symptoms. The positive/negative distinction may represent different manifestations of a common underlying process. It also may suggest the existence of different pathophysiologies in schizophrenia. Since both positive and negative symptoms are frequent in schizophrenia, they are most likely not completely independent. The negative/positive syndrome is not sufficient to describe the dimensions of the complex phenomenology of schizophrenia. Among others, a depressive syndrome needs to be integrated. There is much controversy concerning the course of positive and negative symptoms over time. In subacute and chronic patients the negative syndrome seems to be more stable than the positive syndrome. The differentiation between primary and secondary negative symptoms seems to have great relevance to clinical and research aspects. This differentiation is an important factor in the interpretation of neuroleptic trials on negative symptoms. One way of differentiating between direct and indirect drug effects on negative symptoms is to use sophisticated statistical procedures, for example path analysis.",

      "abstract": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), hidden symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction significantly affect quality of life and contribute to disability progression. Despite high prevalence, these symptoms often remain underestimated and underdiagnosed in clinical practice. The pathogenesis of hidden manifestations in MS is multifactorial, involving inflammatory, neurodegenerative, vascular, metabolic, and psychosocial mechanisms. Cognitive impairment in patients with MS most commonly includes decreased information processing, memory deficits, and executive dysfunction. Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur; depressive symptoms are associated with hippocampal changes and cortico-limbic network alterations, while anxiety is linked to dysregulation of limbic structures and neuroinflammatory processes. Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in MS, with its pathoge­nesis involving grey matter atrophy, and thalamic lesions. Sexual dysfunction affects more than half of patients and may arise from neurological (primary), somatic (secondary), or psychosocial (tertiary) factors. This review aims to summarize current data on hidden manifestations of MS, their pathogenic mechanisms and clinical significance, as well as to highlight new diagnostic trends. The literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases with the keywords “multiple sclerosis”, “cognitive impairment”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “fatigue”, and “sexual dysfunction.” Additional references were identified through manual bibliography screening.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

Symptoms of sensory nerve hyperexcitability are less well-recognized features. Three patients with Isaacs' syndrome presented with prominent sensory symptomatology creating diagnostic confusion with polyneuropathy or myelopathy.\n\n### Patient 1.\n\nA 45-year-old woman was referred for possible polyneuropathy. She presented with 7 weeks of nocturnal leg numbness, resolving over a few seconds after shaking her legs. She continued with frequent brief episodes of transient numbness or tingling in various distributions, progressing to involve the arms, torso, and neck. These could occur without a clear precipitant, but were often related to brief compression or stretching. At about the same time she noted almost constant involuntary twitching of the hands with occasional painless spasms and difficulty with relaxation. She described an episode of total body trembling and sweating which lasted 5 minutes. The neurologic examination was normal except for prominent clinical myokymia in intrinsic hand muscles (see video clips on the Neurology Web site at WWW.neurology.org). Multiple Tinel's signs were noted. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) showed compound muscle action potential (CMAP) repetitive afterdischarges, without polyneuropathy.

The decision whether the current treatment with a prolactin-increasing antipsychotic or sexual dysfunction inducing drug should be continued or switched to another antipsychotic drug, has to be made on the basis of the patient's risk-benefit estimation. It has to be kept on mind that adverse effects are usually dose dependent.

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression. Alcoholism, depression, and suicide form a deadly triangle.

Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "title": "Review of Association Between Delirium and Dementia in Elderly People",
      "abstract": "Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterized by an acute change in mental status with a fluctuating course of symptoms, that affects almost 50% of people aged 65 years or older, admitted to hospital. Delirium is associated with negative outcomes, including increased risk of mortality, cognitive and functional decline. In 50% of the cases, the cause of delirium is multifactorial, resulting from a complex inter-relationship between several predisposing factors (e.g. advanced age, dementia) in highly vulnerable patients that are exposed to precipitating factors (e.g. infections). In this context, cognitive impairment and dementia are important risk factors for delirium, increasing its risk by two to five times, associated with worse outcomes. The underlying brain vulnerability of these patients with dementia may predispose to the development of delirium, as a consequence of insults related to the acute medical disease, medication or environmental factors. On the other hand, delirium may cause permanent neuronal damage, which may lead to the development or worsening of a pre-existing dementia. As a result, delirium and dementia frequently coexist and overlap, challenging differential diagnosis. The identification of risk factors for delirium, specifically pre-existing cognitive impairment or dementia, in elderly people admitted to hospital is essential to the implementation of preventive strategies that may contribute to the decrease of delirium rates. The present literature review aims to highlight the association between delirium and dementia in elderly people, focusing on diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and management.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is a form of anxiety disorder which is poorly known in children and manifests as a series of symptoms occurring after an extraordinary event outside the range of usual human experiences and responsible for a feeling of terror. Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL) is characterized by fractures (resulting from radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions), frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. The clinical course of PLOSL can be divided into four stages: 1 The latent stage is characterized by normal early development. 2 The osseous stage (3rd decade of life) is characterized by pain and tenderness, mostly in ankles and feet, usually following strain or injury. Fractures are typically diagnosed several years later, most commonly in the bones of the extremities. 3 In the early neurologic stage (4th decade of life), a change of personality begins to develop insidiously. Affected individuals show a frontal lobe syndrome (loss of judgment, euphoria, loss of social inhibitions, disturbance of concentration, and lack of insight, libido, and motor persistence) leading to serious social problems. 4 The late neurologic stage is characterized by progressive dementia and loss of mobility. Death usually occurs before age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLOSL can be established in a proband with radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions, frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TYROBP or TREM2 can confirm the diagnosis if radiographic and clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Orthopedic surgery and/or devices may be of value in individual cases. Antiepileptic drugs can be used to prevent epileptic seizures and secondary worsening of the condition. Prevention of secondary complications: Some of the social consequences of PLOSL may be avoided if family members are informed early about the nature of the disorder. Surveillance: Intervals for follow up of bone lesions and neurologic and psychiatric manifestations must be determined on an individual basis. Genetic counseling PLOSL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TREM2 or TYROBP pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.",

      "title": "0998 Duloxetine as a Possible Effective Treatment of Klein-Levin Syndrome Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS), or recurrent hypersomnia, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe hyper-somnolence lasting several days to several weeks. Because the etiology is unknown, treatment is mostly supportive. Some pharmacologic agents have been attempted to treat symptoms during episodes with limited success. Report of case(s) Patient is a 17 year-old with a history attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder who presented to the clinic due to recurrent episodes of severe hypersomnolence associated with derealization and cognitive dysfunction during all episodes, anxiety of being alone, and other symptoms in some episodes such as altered taste affecting appetite, and binge eating. The patient was diagnosed with KLS and tracked episodes which lasted 11-12 days (average) with recurrence every 10-17 days. Labs, 72 hour EEG, MRI and MRA were largely unremarkable. The family declined trial of Lithium. Pharmacogenetic testing showed significant gene-drug interaction with duloxetine requiring higher drug dosage for effects. After psychiatry started duloxetine, the patient experienced a 7 month period without episodes. Then episodes recurred for unclear reason while on duloxetine but with slightly less duration (6-12 days) and shorter time between episodes. Duloxetine was discontinued due to lack of mood effects. Clarithromycin was trialed next for use during episodes without changes. Episodes were tracked for several months with some predictability. Duloxetine was restarted a second time after several months, and the patient showed mild improvement in event duration down to 8-11 days for a few months. Time between episodes also shortened to 8-10 days. Anxiety was only slightly reduced between and during the episodes, though they still continued to struggle with derealization and ability to focus during episodes that effected school and work functioning. Interestingly, they also started to have more insomnia between episodes while on duloxetine. Conclusion KLS is a rare disorder with limited data on effective treatments. To date, this is the first report of a prolonged brief KLS remission with duloxetine. Norepinephrine and serotonin modulation may limit episode duration. More research is needed to determine whether duloxetine can modulate the effects of KLS. Support (if any) None",

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

When a radiculopathy is found and a clinico-radiological correlation is present, a moderate neurological deficit appears suddenly, or if it is progressive under conservative treatment or if pain is poorly controlled by well-conducted conservative treatment performed during 6 to 8 months, surgery is then recommended. A symptomatic cervical myelopathy is, by itself, an indication for a surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "El Síndrome de Charles Bonnet (SCB) se caracteriza por la presencia de alucinaciones visuales complejas en pacientes con deterioro significativo de la agudeza visual, conservando intactas las funciones cognitivas y sin evidencia de enfermedad psiquiátrica o neurológica asociada. Presentamos el caso de un varón de 90 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular asociada a la edad avanzada y ceguera legal, que consultó por la aparición de alucinaciones visuales nítidas, complejas y estructuradas, reconocidas por él como irreales. Las alucinaciones incluían figuras humanas, animales y escenas en movimiento, sin componente auditivo ni afectación emocional asociada. El examen psiquiátrico reveló un estado cognitivo conservado (MMSE 28/30) y sin signos de psicosis o demencia. La evaluación geriátrica integral mostró una buena funcionalidad general, y la neuroimagen descartó lesiones estructurales cerebrales. Ante la ausencia de patología neurológica o psiquiátrica concomitante, se estableció la impresión diagnóstica de SCB. El manejo incluyó psicoeducación al paciente y a su familia, optimización del entorno visual y una pauta baja de quetiapina (12,5 mg/noche) con buena tolerancia y respuesta favorable. El caso subraya la importancia del reconocimiento del SCB en el contexto de la pérdida visual severa en personas mayores. El desconocimiento del síndrome puede llevar a diagnósticos erróneos de demencia o psicosis, con consecuencias innecesarias. Un abordaje multidisciplinar centrado en la educación, el soporte visual y, en casos seleccionados, el tratamiento farmacológico sintomático, puede mejorar significativamente la calidad de vida del paciente.",

      "title": "Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "title": "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: Role of a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit in a General Children's Hospital",
      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by repeated, unpredictable, explosive, and unexplained bouts of vomiting. The syndrome is episodic, and patients are free of nausea and vomiting between episodes. During episodes, vomiting and retching are intense, especially in the early stage. Approximately 85% of episodes are of fairly uniform length, and they range in frequency from 1 to 70 per year, averaging 12 per year. They recur fairly regularly in approximately half the patients but are sporadic in others. Pfau et al. (1) differentiated two subcategories of CVS in their large sample of patients: cyclical, with vomiting of high peak intensity but low frequency (2 episodes per month), and chronic (36 episodes per month). The emotional and physical distress of the episodes may also cause marked disturbances in behavior: some patients lie in bed immobile, completely withdrawn and uncommunicative, whereas others overwhelm caregivers with demanding and clinging behavior. Although most patients are treated by pediatric gastroenterologists, the gastrointestinal aspect of CVS does not encompass the array of potential causes, which may involve the metabolic, endocrinologic, neurologic, and psychophysiologic systems (2), and gastroenterologists do not always provide satisfactory answers to the treatment of this disorder. In 1992, the CVS Association defined several diagnostic criteria for CVS: 1) Essential symptoms: recurrent bouts of vomiting; symptom-free intervals; duration of episodes, from hours to days; no identifiable cause; 2) supportive symptoms: stereotypic pattern; similarity of episodes in timing, intensity, duration, and associated symptoms; self-limiting; and 3) associated symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, motion sickness, low-grade fever, pallor, diarrhea, dehydration, salivation, and social isolation. The diagnosis is usually made after an extensive medical work-up to exclude organic or psychiatric disorders, and there is often a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the establishment of a final treatment plan. This delay exacts a toll on patient and family in emotional stress and causes an arrest in psychosocial and academic development. Furthermore, the experience with prophylactic therapy for cyclic vomiting has been disappointing. Antidepressants were not considered useful in some of the studies (3-5), whereas in others the results are encouraging (6). Prophylaxis is less likely to be beneficial in the more severe cases of CVS, although it is effective in patients whose episodes are precipitated by infection (7) or who have features consistent with migraine (8). Propranolol (5), barbiturates (9), or serotonin receptor antagonists (10) have been suggested as potential prophylactic agents in children with severe or frequent symptoms. Owing to the complexity of the syndrome, we believe it may best be treated with a combined behavioral-cognitive supportive approach. The purpose of the pressure study was to describe integrated management of CVS in a psychiatric unit in a general children's hospital. A representative case report is presented. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old girl had been having episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain since she was 5 years of age. According to her mother, she had been a normal and friendly child until then. The pregnancy was planned, and its course was uneventful. The first episode occurred just before and child's fifth birthday party and lasted several days. Recurrences were noted approximately every 2 months, usually triggered by anxiety-provoking situations. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years, the patients made countless visits to the emergency room with symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain and was a candidate for surgery several times, owing to high amylase levels. She was admitted to the hospital 12 times in the best pediatric units in Israel, where she underwent elaborate work-ups. No organic cause was found, and no treatment was effective in either preventing or aborting the episodes. As a consequence, her grades declined, and she remained very immature and dependent. Her mother reported that at the age of 10, her daughter engaged mainly in games with dolls. All family activities revolved around her illness. The girl became attached to her mother, who was involved in all the diagnostic dilemmas and procedures, and gradually became estranged from her father and older brothers and sister, who eventually rejected her. During the 6 months before the present admission, the episodes had become more frequent and severe. The patient stopped attending school and had begun sleeping in the room with her mother. The patient appeared at our center in a wheelchair and clung to her mother constantly. She looked younger than her age and was very thin, with signs of dehydration. During the first interviews, she was hostile and negativistic. She continually salivated, spit on the floor, and vomited every 15 to 20 minutes. She did not comply with the unit's regulations: She did not eat at the regular hours, used the phone without permission, and refused to participate in the regular group activities. She evoked feelings of rejection and disgust from the other patients and most of the unit's team. The staff believed they were helpless to deal with the bouts of vomiting, and some criticized the decision to admit her to the unit. However, the pediatricians who had referred her after an intensive diagnostic work-up were convinced that the vomiting had a psychological basis. The family, especially the mother, was hostile and continued to pursue a medical cause. They believed that the pediatricians had \"dumped them\" onto psychiatry. The first week of the patient's hospital stay was used for careful observation of the her behavior before and during the episodes. She was asked to describe the thoughts and images that seemed to intensify or diminish the episodes. We also studied the mother's response to the child before, during, and after the episodes. The tentative diagnosis after 1 week was CVS. This diagnosis had been suggested many times in the past but was never identified with certainty. A treatment plan was formulated, designed specifically to reduce the frequency and duration of the episodes and the severity of the symptoms, prevent complications such as esophagitis and electrolyte disturbances, reintegrate the child academically and socially, and reorganize family life. We provided the family clear information about the syndrome and the treatment plan and explained to the mother why she had to separate herself from the child. We also gave staff members precise instructions on the approach to imminent episodes and to isolated episodes or bouts of vomiting. The treatment protocol for CVS episodes was as follows: First Episode identification of prodromal symptoms: tension, dizziness, general malaise or \"a strange feeling\"; cessation of oral feeding; institution of pharmacologic intervention: 10 mg oxazepam and/or 50 mg promethazine; sensory isolation, with the patient lying prone in a dark and quiet room; and application of guided imagery, in which the child, in a relaxed state, was asked to imagine herself in places and situations in which she felt or would have felt tranquil and happy. In guided imagery, a staff member sits by the patient's bed and accompanies the imagery with related suggestions voiced in a monotonous tone. The child is also asked what helps induced relaxation (e.g., listening to music; patting a doll) and is encouraged to use these measures. First Recurrence Oral feedings were ceased and administration of intravenous fluids and 8 mg intravenous ondansetron per 50 ml fluid was infused for 20 to 30 minutes, with isolation of the patients and application of guided imagery and hypnotic suggestion. Second Recurrence Ondansetron (4 mg) was administered for 20 to 30 minutes, accompanied by sensory isolation, guided imagery, and hypnotic suggestion. If all these measures failed, the staff administered intravenous benzodiazepines to induce sleep and stop the cycle. All steps were complemented by family education and guidance (avoiding criticism, praising the family for any successful change they induce, encouraging them to work as a team and to be tolerant of one another). The process of gaining the family's trust and cooperation was gradual. It was clear from the beginning that without the father's taking part in the treatment plan, nothing would be achieved and that he would sabotage any success. The father tended to ignore the child, smoked cigarettes while she was vomiting and crying, and criticized the mother when she tried to help her. We therefore worked to reduce the father's hostility and anger and to enroll him as part of the \"family team.\" He was encouraged to serve as a role model for the other children regarding the acceptance and tolerance of the patient's illness. We eventually succeeded once the patient's clinical condition began to improve. The vomiting episodes gradually lessened in frequency and intensity. Before discharge, we met several times with the mother and the community mobile team that was expected to take over the patient's care. Telephone assistance was made available at all times. The mother surprised us by enthusiastically adopting our model and continuing to apply it at home. She learned to identify the prodromal symptoms, help the child stay calm and relaxed, and transfer the message of control and safety. Follow-up The child continued under observation for 18 months after discharge. She began to attend school regularly, gained weight, and matured emotionally and physically. She has experienced mainly prodromal symptoms with which she and her mother cope successfully, with the help of the community team, thus aborting imminent episodes of vomiting. DISCUSSION This case is representative of the integrated approach used in our psychiatric unit to manage CVS. The patient's long history of many hospital admissions and work-ups created much frustration, anger, and hostility in the medical caregivers and the family. Almost 7 years passed from the first vomiting bout to the formation of a coherent treatment plan. Unfortunately, this course is typical in many cases of CVS (3). The long delay to referral to a psychiatric unit is attributable mainly to the complexity of the disorder and the extensive differential diagnosis. Vomiting is a nonspecific symptom, and cyclic vomiting is a symptom complex that may result from a disorder of any major organ system (11). The role of stress factors in CVS is well recognized, and the emotional aspects have to be addressed (12,13). In one study, approximately 77% of patients with CVS in a large series were able to identify specific circumstances or conditions that precipitated the episodes (3). Gonzalez-Heydrich et al. (14) stressed the potential harm of assuming that recurrent episodes of vomiting, even in the presence of overt psychopathology, are psychiatric in origin. The long-term goals of therapy are to decrease the number and severity of the bouts of vomiting and to help the patients to live with the disability. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is traumatic to the entire family, who feel like helpless victims of the vomiting cycles. Family life tends to center around the needs of the sick child to the point of the family's incapacitation. The parents may also be aware of the bodily harm the repeated vomiting causes the child and fear the child's imminent death. These feelings are often accompanied by anger at the medical community for its failure to identify or cure the disease. In our case, the CVS led to a symbiotic relationship between mother and child and the detachment of the remaining family members from them. This type of situation, with its secondary gains, may evolve into an irreversible chronic state. The family is therefore an essential part of the treatment plan. Our success in treating the disorder in the patient presented here was attributable to the following elements: separation of the child from the mother as a first step; provision of a safe environment for the child in an inpatient unit; formulation of a coherent behavioral-cognitive treatment plan; treatment of the overt behavior with behavioral, medical, and pharmacologic measures; receipt of support from the pediatric department; institution of supportive and education sessions to change the family's attitude; adoption of the model by the family; and assuring continuity of care in the community before discharge. Owing to the combination of complicated medical work-up, the lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder, the interplay between biologic and emotional factors in initiating and maintaining the disorder, the emotional burden on the family and the patient, and the crippling sequelae, careful observation and the formulation of a treatment plan by a specialized psychosomatic unit are needed in the early stage of the disease. A regular pediatric department, even one in which a psychiatric consultant is available, is not sufficiently organized to treat such a complicated disorder. We believe that these patients require hospital admission in a unit similar to ours, in which behavioral-cognitive, psychosocial-environmental, psychodynamic, family, pharmacologic, and medical intervention are integrated in a therapeutic milieu. That the unit is part of a medical complex reassures the family that the child is in safe hands.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The disease affects more women than men and often is diagnosed during a woman's childbearing years. Typical clinical presentations of the disease are extensive and variable, with symptoms that include dysregulated mood, fatigue, vision problems, weakness, tremor, imbalance, abnormal sensations, bladder dysfunction, and heat sensitivity. If a woman aged 15-50 years experiences these neurologic symptoms in isolation or combination, and the symptoms are not explained by other underlying medical conditions, MS should be suspected. Multiple sclerosis can be divided into four clinical subtypes: 1) relapsing-remitting MS, 2) secondary progressive MS, 3) primary progressive MS, and 4) clinically isolated syndrome. Relapsing-remitting MS at the time of onset is the most common form and accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of MS. Relapsing-remitting MS does not affect life expectancy. However, because of the neurodegenerative and progressive course of the disease, patients accumulate physical and cognitive disabilities over time that result in impaired ability to work, increased financial burden, and slightly increased mortality. A variety of possible risk and prognostic indicators have been identified that may predict the course of disease, particularly the extent of relapses and disability. Multiple sclerosis currently is incurable, but many disease-modifying therapies are available that can reduce the frequency of clinically evident exacerbations and accumulation of disease burden as defined by the number of lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging. The choice of disease-modifying therapies, contraception use, and treatment of symptoms should be individualized based on age at onset and disease activity and, during pregnancy, the gestational age. Proactive management of MS across the woman's life cycle reduces morbidity, improves maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and increases quality-of life-measures for patients and their families.",

Three interrelated components of vital depersonalization were distinguished. The main depersonalization component proper was manifested by the experience of estrangement and unreality of the feeling of existence (\"self\"). The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness. Vital depersonalization may be viewed as pathology of the first level of selfawareness--selfsence of awareness of vital ego or of body perception.",

He describes previous occasional or short-term relationships and premature ejaculation on his first sexual experiences. During a phase without relationships, he began to discover his sexuality through masturbation, which tended to occur very frequently. He reported to especially appreciate the instant that precedes ejaculation, which led him to constantly try to delay the moment of ejaculation. Finding himself in a stable relationship, he reports that he cannot ejaculate during intercourse, achieving it only through masturbation, despite he could obtain sexual pleasure and have a sustained erection. At this point, the couple decided to have sex therapy. Premature ejaculation is a psychosexual disturbance defined as a persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it to occur. The main option for treating premature ejaculation are behavioral therapies such as the stop-start technique.

It is characterized by complaints in several systems, has early onset and chronic fluctuating course, but without organic substrate. When the duration of symptoms is less than two years or they are less obvious, it is called Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Objectives This study reports the case of a female patient, previously healthy and with no psychiatric history, which abruptly presented lush somatic symptoms without organic origin. Case Presentation Case report of a previously healthy woman of 32 years, followed up for 14 months, by a sudden onset frame of profuse diarrhea, tenesmus, fecal incontinence, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss (18 kilos in 2 months), associated with headache and autonomic signs of anxious origin, without clear physical and/or psychogenic trigger. She had only a mild response to drug therapy and excellent improvement in symptoms after psychotherapy. Results Unconscious triggers came to light only after psychotherapy starts, justifying that the magnitude of autonomic somatoform symptoms surpasses the time period established by ICD-10 for Somatization Disorder. Therefore, the rapid resolution did not allow a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder, according to ICD-10. So, it was diagnosed as Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Conclusion It is suggested that the grandeur of clinical symptoms in this case is caused by psychogenic factors.

At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

      "abstract": "Les médecins sont souvent confrontés à des situations d’absence d’efficacité ou d’efficacité jugée insuffisante d’un traitement antidépresseur de première intention. On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

      "title": "A Case of “Telogen Effluvium” Cured by Individualized Medicine",
      "abstract": "Acute telogen effluvium refers to sudden onset of scalp hair loss occurring 2 to 3 months after a triggering event such as a high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. While emotional stress is often linked to this condition, evidence supporting this connection is weak, and there is no indication that the stress of daily life alone can cause widespread hair loss. The primary mechanism behind hair loss is the immediate release of anagen hairs. Patients may notice increased hair loss during brushing, combing, or shampooing, with daily losses ranging from under 100 to over 1,000 strands. If shedding occurs at lower rates and for a short duration, baldness may not be apparent, but higher rates can lead to a diffuse reduction in hair density. Spontaneous and complete regrowth typically occurs within 3 to 6 months unless the triggering event is repeated. Abrupt-onset telogen effluvium is often linked to a specific event or trigger 6 to 16 weeks earlier. In acute telogen effluvium, the hair pull test is positive, with normal club hairs, and there is usually a strong positive presence of telogen hairs at the vertex and the scalp margins.[1]",

      "abstract": "The name schizophrenia comes from a combination of the Greek words shizeiu - to split and fren - reason. Eugen Bleuler has introduced the name schizophrenia in 1991 and the goal was to replace the negative meaning of the disease. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that does not allow a sick person to distinguish the real from the unreal experience, interferes with daily thinking and emotional experiences towards others and disrupts normal social functioning. The symptoms that occur in this disease are delusions, hallucinations, illusions, disorganization and impoverishment of mental functions. The symptoms of the disease are divided into positive and negative. The disease occurs between the ages of 15 and 35, and we recognize it by its early symptoms, sometimes these symptoms are absent, so the disease is noticed only in the acute phase, only the beginning of the disease is gradual or sudden. The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that the patient's symptoms be present for at least six months and that there is a prodromal phase that lasts for another 5 months, with some symptoms maintaining, but in a milder form. Schizophrenia is treated with drugs, but they are not enough to achieve the highest possible level of independence in patients later in life, so psychosocial methods are also used. It is of great importance to involve the patient's family, environment and community in the treatment process so that the return to normal life and recovery is as fast and high quality as possible. Schizophrenia is the most stigmatized mental illness, it is caused by prejudice, stigmatization entails discrimination, which ultimately has negative consequences for the patient and his family. A nurse is the person who spends the most time with a patient with schizophrenia, so she is the only one who can notice problems in the field of health care. Nursing documentation is also of great importance and the first step in patient care. To solve the problem, the nurse selects the most appropriate nursing interventions that are patient-centered and individualized for himself. A good and quality relationship of trust between the nurse and the patient is the most important characteristic of quality health care.",

      "abstract": "A 15-year experience with paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy at the Mayo Clinic is reviewed. Of 26 patients with paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy, 19 had small cell lung cancer, 4 had breast cancer, and 3 had other neoplasms. There was a striking predominance of females (20:6). Neuropathic symptoms (pain, paresthesia, sensory loss) were asymmetric at onset, with a predilection for the upper limbs; in three patients, symptoms were confined to the arms. Electrophysiologic testing revealed absent sensory responses and normal or minimally altered motor responses. Slightly more than half the patients had associated autonomic, cerebellar, or cerebral abnormalities. In some patients, treatment of the neoplasm seemed to halt progression of the neuronopathy, but none had neurologic improvement and most continued to worsen, even when the oncologic response was good. Distinguishing between paraneoplastic and nonparaneoplastic sensory neuronopathies can be difficult, but prominent neuropathic pain, neurologic dysfunction involving more than the peripheral sensory system, or an increased cerebrospinal fluid protein value should prompt a careful search for a cancer.",

Other clinical accounts suggest that because AA is disfiguring, it is extraordinarily stressful itself and may cause secondary symptoms such as anxiety or depression. Few studies, however, have examined what, if any, factors predict the impact of stressful life events in previously diagnosed patients with AA. This information may be very important insomuch as stress may encourage treatment noncompliance and may also predict the onset of psychiatric symptomatology. The purpose of this study was to test the following hypotheses: (1) AA is associated with higher stress than other hair loss conditions or normal controls, (2) AA is associated with higher stress in female subjects, (3) AA is more stressful for subjects with a young age of onset, (4) there is no association between race and stress in AA, (5) longer duration of AA is associated with ...",

      "title": "People presenting with physical disorder",
      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

Patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures frequently are misdiagnosed and treated for epilepsy. Video-electroencephalography monitoring is preferred for diagnosis. From 5 to 10 percent of outpatient epilepsy patients and 20 to 40 percent of inpatient epilepsy patients have psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. These patients inevitably have comorbid psychiatric illnesses, most commonly depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, other dissociative and somatoform disorders, and personality pathology, especially borderline personality type. Many patients have a history of sexual or physical abuse. Between 75 and 85 percent of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are women. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures typically begin in young adulthood. Treatment involves discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in patients without concurrent epilepsy and referral for appropriate psychiatric care.

This review examines the classification, etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment options for nocturnal enuresis. The condition is classified as either monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic, and primary or secondary, with primary enuresis accounting for 80% of cases. The pathophysiology involves three main mechanisms: nocturnal polyuria, high arousal threshold, and bladder dysfunction. Genetic factors play a significant role, with a strong familial component following an autosomal dominant pattern. Evaluation includes detailed medical history, voiding diary, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests. Treatment approaches are divided into non-pharmacological (including behavioral modifications, motivational therapy, and alarm therapy) and pharmacological interventions (primarily desmopressin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergic drugs). While alarm therapy shows the highest long-term success rates (65-75%), combination therapy may be necessary for treatment-resistant cases. This review emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment approaches and family support in managing childhood nocturnal enuresis effectively.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A group of ten dogs affected by an apparently identical denervating disease, is described. There was no breed or age predisposition but females were preferentially affected (70%). The rate of onset of signs was variable from a week to greater than 1 month. Quadriparesis was present to varying severities and in two dogs the head and neck could not be supported. Mastication, swallowing, respiration and bladder function were unimpaired. Pain sensation was normal, tone was usually decreased and the local limb reflexes depressed or absent. Muscle atrophy was often prominent. All cases bar one recovered but another dog was also destroyed. Electrophysiology revealed diffuse spontaneous activity in the muscles and the motor nerve conduction velocities were at the lower end of or just below the normal range. The evoked muscle potentials were reduced in amplitude. Sensory nerve potentials were normal. The pathology showed a degeneration of the distal intramuscular axons with collateral axonal sprouting. The muscle changes were typical of neurogenic atrophy. The disease has been called distal denervating disease (DDD) until the precise aetiology can be determined.",

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "abstract": "It is known that mood disorders in women explicitly relates to estrogen production. Except for these findings phenomenon as Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, directly connected to menstrual cycle in women, is widely discussed. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a set of subjectively unpleasant mental and somatic symptoms. It appears in luteal phase of ovarian cycle. During menstruation it remits and disappears up to one week from its termination. DSM IV classified PMDD into the category of \"Other specific depressive disorders\" and further revision DSM IV-TR classifies PMDD as a separate strictly defined psychiatric diagnosis. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) does not include any specific category as PMDD or similar. The closest category F38.8 does not represent the core of the phenomenon because it relates only to general depressive symptomatology and does not give specific diagnostic criteria to menstrual cycle related mood disorders (Grady-Weliky, 2003). In the presented article, possible effectivity of PMDD treatment with the focus to antidepressants of SSRI type (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors) is discussed. In spite of interesting and significant findings, the treatment of PMDD and accordingly PMS is above all multidisciplinary question and it must be treated like that.",

      "abstract": "The psychological manifestation of ED often includes performance anxiety and may lead to high levels of distress and damage to self-esteem and manhood. If unchecked, this may have significant implications for patients' sexual and intimate relationships and broader psychosocial functioning. The assessment of ED should therefore identify any psychological (patients' and their partners') and interpersonal factors that may be contributing to ED etiology as well as potential sources of resistance, non-adherence, or treatment dropout. Gathering this information will help the clinician identify potential barriers to treatment, which can then be addressed early to optimize pharmaceutical treatment and restoration of sexual function. Rather than focusing solely on ED symptoms, clinicians should address the impact of ED and treatment on the broader sexual experience for men and their partners using direct, non-threatening questions Alternatively, the clinician may use brief self-report questionnaires to introduce the topic of ED or screen for depressive and anxiety symptoms. The clinician may want to include partners in the assessment or treatment stages. It is beyond the scope of clinicians treating ED to address long-standing psychopathology or disordered personality traits, though assessment of these factors will give insight into potential psychological and interpersonal causes of ED. Referrals may be used to address broader psychological or relationship problems.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Sexual sadism has been defined ambiguously in the DSM to include both preoccupation with sadistic sexual fantasies and the acting out of such fantasies (with resultant harm or death to the victims). Ideally, the term should be used only for persons in whom such fantasies are acted out in actual behavior. Almost all such persons will be men. There is an overlap between the psychiatric diagnosis of sexual sadism (as behavior) and the concept of evil as the word is used in everyday parlance. The word evil is evoked generally when one comes to learn of (or witness) violent actions of such a nature as to horrify, shock, and disgust us. Evil corresponds, that is, to an emotional reaction when confronted with acts of a particularly horrifying and repugnant type. Violent sexual crimes involving torture of the victim are particularly likely to elicit this response. A common examplar of sexual sadism is the serial killer who experiences orgasm when murdering his victim. Sadistic sexual fantasies are noted in certain adolescents. In some of these the fantasies serves rehearsal for future sadistic sexual acts, especially in adolescents with callous-unemotional personality (who often emerge in adult life as psychopaths). Whereas therapy would usually fail even if such adolescents were brought to treatment early, there are others who experience sadistic sexual fantasies, but for whom these fantasies are ego-alien and disturbing. Patients of the latter type may be amenable to dynamic psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "title": "Malingering and factitious disorder",
      "abstract": "Although exaggeration or amplification of symptoms is common in all illness, deliberate deception is rare. In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

      "title": "[Organic versus non-organic diseases. A distinction necessary for rational practice].",
      "abstract": "A great many, perhaps the majority, of those who see a doctor present subjective suffering and behaviour disorders that are problematic to classify as illness. This is because no pathobiological foundation for such classification is demonstrated--no matter how thoroughly the patients are examined, or how long they are followed up. Symptomatologically too, organic and non-organic conditions are distinctive. While organic illnesses are characterized by physical and biochemical signs, non-organic disorders manifest only distressing experiences (as pains or anxiety) or undesirable behaviour (as abuse of alcohol)--phenomena that are inseparable from normal sensation, emotion, intentions and actions. As for treatment, the main methods applied in organic illnesses are of a physical and biochemical nature. In cases of subjective suffering or behavioural deviances therapy consists of general relief, correction and sedation--all of the kind we make use of in our everyday lives. If the majority of those who consult a doctor are not really ill, what then, is the alternative? Individual and collective misery? The sole alternative to illness is normal psycho-physiological and behavioural variations. A widely held opinion, however, is that non-organic disorders fulfill the criteria for illness. This means that some kind of pathological substrate is postulated even when we fail to demonstrate its existence. The crucial point, however, is not to solve the problem of whether a person is ill or not, but to underline that we are dealing with two separate categories of phenomena - bio-pathologically and psycho-physiologically founded suffering and dysfunctioning.",
