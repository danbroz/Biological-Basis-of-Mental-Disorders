      "title": "Bulimia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Abstract Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by three primary symptoms: recurrent episodes of binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and extreme concern about body weight and shape. Binge eating involves the consumption of a large amount of food in a relatively short period of time along with a perception of loss of control over eating. Binge eating may be triggered by a number of factors including hunger, negative mood, interpersonal stressors, and thoughts about weight and shape. Inappropriate compensatory behaviors are strategies aimed at controlling body weight and shape, including self‐induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives and/or diuretics, excessive exercising, and fasting.",

Bulimia nervosa has been described as 'a syndrome characterised by repeated bouts of overeating and an excessive preoccupation with the control of body weight, leading to a pattern of overeating followed by vomiting or use of purgatives … often but not always with a history of an earlier episode of anorexia nervosa' (ICD-10, p. 352). For a diagnosis to be made, the following should all be present: Persistent preoccupation with eating and an irresistible craving for food with bouts of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed in a short period of time. Behaviour designed to counteract the effects of the above by using one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting, purging, alternating periods of starvation, use of appetite suppressants, thyroid preparations or diuretics. A morbid fear of fatness with a low target weight set.

      "abstract": "Disgust with ‘fatness' and a consequent preoccupation with body weight, coupled with an inability to reduce it to or sustain it at the desired low level, characterizes the abnormal normal weight control syndrome. Individuals remain sexually active in a biological sense and often also socially. Indeed their sexual behaviour may be as impulse ridden as is their eating behaviour, which often comprises phases of massive bingeing coupled with vomiting and/or purgation. The syndrome is unlike frank anorexia nervosa in that the latter involves a regression to a position of phobic avoidance of normal body weight and consequent low body weight control with inhibition of both biological and social sexual activity. In abnormal normal weight control there is a strong and sometimes desperate hedonistic and extrovert element that will often not be denied so long as body weight does not get too low. Individuals nevertheless feel desperately ‘out of control’ and insecure beneath their bravura. The syndrome is much more common in females than in males. There is a clinical overlap with anorexia nervosa and obesity in many cases as the disorder evolves. Depression, stealing, drug dependence (including alcohol) and acute self-poisoning and self-mutilation are common complications. Clinic cases probably only represent the tip of the iceberg of a much more widespread morbidity within the general population. Like anorexia nervosa and for the same reasons the disorder is probably more common than it used to be.",

      "title": "[Nighttime eating disorders--clinical symptoms and treatment].",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment.

The onset is insidious and gradual, although the patient, usually a woman, may associate its beginning with some unusual dietary event, as a party, or indulgence above the ordinary in unusual foods. This event, however, should it occur, usually marks a culmination rather than a commencement.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as known in the DSM-IV as eating disorders are characterized by physically and/or psychologically harmful eating patterns. Although the psychological explanation of what we now call anorexia nervosa have been known about for centuries, it has only recently attracted much interest, due to greater public knowledge and increased incidence (according to Gross and MclLveen 2006, the latter claim has been disputed). Most people suffering from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa start by fasting. Anorexia nervosa is a deliberate self-starvation. A person whose body weight is less than expected for his or her body height and weight is considered to be anorexic. In contract, bulimia involves binge eating a large quantity of food followed by purging by self-induced vomiting, enemas, laxatives, or diuretics.",

      "title": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy of Binge Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent episodes of uncontrollable eating, even when not hungry, until uncomfortably full, occurring at least twice a week for a 6-month period. This is differentiated from bulimia nervosa (BN) by the lack of compensatory mechanisms such as purging/laxative abuse. There are significantly higher levels of psychiatric symptoms in patients with BED as compared to those without BED. Furthermore, depressive symptomatology may increase the patient's vulnerability to binge eating as well as to relapse after treatment. Grazing is defined as eating small amounts of food continuously. BED in the pre-bariatric patient can manifest as 'grazing' about 2 years post-bariatric surgery. Treatment should be directed at eating behavior, associated psychopathology, weight and psychiatric symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy is based on changing the patient's erroneous ways of thinking about themselves, the world and how others perceive them. This includes a focus on normalizing food intake as well as challenging dysfunctional thinking, identifying feelings, and developing non-food coping skills. It increases a sense of control and therefore helps the patient adhere to behavior change strategy, as well as improving mood and reducing associated psychopathology. Interpersonal therapy is based on the relationship between negative mood low self-esteem traumatic life events, interpersonal functioning and the patient's eating behavior. The rationale being that eating represents maladaptive coping with underlying difficulties. While psychotherapy either CBT or IPT leads to decrease in disordered eating behaviors and improved psychiatric symptoms, it has little effect on weight hence; its benefit is optimal when used in conjunction with bariatric surgery.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by restricted eating and a relentless pursuit of thinness that tends to present in females during adolescence according to DSM-IV (Table 1). Individuals with AN exhibit an ego-syntonic resistance to eating and a powerful pursuit of weight loss, yet are paradoxically preoccupied with food and eating rituals to the point of obsession. Individuals have a distorted body image and, even when emaciated, tend to see themselves as \"fat,\" express denial of being underweight, and compulsively overexercise. Two types of eating-related behavior are seen in AN. In restricting-type anorexia (AN), individuals lose weight purely by dieting without binge eating or purging. In binge-eating/purging-type anorexia, individuals also restrict their food intake to lose weight but have a periodic disinhibition of restraint and engage in binge eating and/or purging, also seen in bulimia nervosa (BN). Anorexia nervosa is often kept hidden by patients who are excessively preoccupied by their current body weight/shape and are ashamed of any compensatory behaviors they engage in. Illness often becomes apparent when patients become emaciated from gradually losing weight or in the purging subtype when patients become physiologically unstable from excessive self-induced loss of fluids or electrolytes. Onset is typically around puberty and is usually preceded by anxiety disorders and followed by a prolonged clinical course with the highest mortality for any psychiatric illness. Outcome is often hindered by an unwillingness to seek treatment. A limited understanding of etiological mechanisms and the lack of powerful treatments are major impediments to providing effective care. Still, there is evidence supporting cautious optimism regarding the development of more effective therapy. For example, although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for AN, some short-term studies suggest that second-generation antipsychotics may be beneficial. For adolescents who develop AN before the age of 18, Maudsley family therapy may be an effective alternative.",

      "title": "The psychological basis of hunger and its dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "This article describes a new and emerging psychological perspective on hunger, together with the implications of that perspective, which is based upon learning and memory. Hunger is a psychological state characterized by a desire to eat. Historically, conceptions of hunger have largely been expressed in terms of physiology (eg, biological process X causes hunger). However, physiology neither offers a psychological account of hunger nor explains why memory impairment can eliminate hunger. Two forms of hunger are identified - specific and general. Specific hunger is for particular palatable foods. It involves recollecting episodic memories of eating that food, when an associated cue is encountered (eg, an advert). General hunger is a desire to eat triggered by temporal (eg, it is lunchtime) or interoceptive (eg, tummy rumble) cues. It involves semantic memory retrieval, which then augments the expected - remembered - pleasure for any food. Both hungers are supported by the medial temporal lobe memory system. Damage to this system can occur from eating a Western-style diet and, longer-term, from obesity and its consequences. Medial temporal lobe memory damage may cause deficits in specific hunger, but most especially in general hunger, resulting in little motivation to eat foods that the individual considers to be of low-to-moderate palatability, such as fruit and vegetables. The implications of this account for teaching people hunger, for how hunger is affected by diet, for public education, and pharmaceutical intervention, are discussed. Psychological concepts of hunger are widely used in nutritional practice. This article provides a new and emerging perspective on the psychological basis of hunger and its implications.",

Over the course of more than three decades of working with and supervising therapists working with individuals with a wide range of eating-related symptoms, including anorexia, bulimia, compulsive overeating, binge eating, avoidant/restrictive eating, and other variations, I have often seen that even small changes can also trigger the behaviors. For example, a number of clients report that they binge on Sunday nights as they start thinking about going back to work the next day. Visits to family (not necessarily a small transition, of course) are also frequent triggers.This article will address some of the possible interplay between unmanageable and/or unformulated affects, on the one hand, and shifts in an individual's sense of self, on the other, which can occur in the course of a transition. Clinical material from my long-term, two-part work with a client who developed symptoms in adolescence and had a recurrence during COVID will illustrate some of these complex interactions and some of the ways that an integrative, psychodynamically-oriented framework can be used to work with these issues.",

The first includes those patients in which a propulsion defect is prevalent (inertia coli) and the second one comprehends those in which a predominant expulsion defect is found. This second group consists of patients with myogenic, neurogenic or mechanical disorders. Moreover, we can consider in this group those patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who show a reduction of rectal compliance and those who produce \"inappropriate stools\". Finally, in this group we can find those patients having the so-called faecal impaction, that is an abnormality of either sensitivity or stimulus to defecate frequently observed in the elderly and in children.",

The authors submit two case-histories of middle aged women (30 and 37 years old) without disturbances of the day-time eating behaviour, without obvious psychopathology where the symptomatology of NES developed slowly from the age of 14 and 25 years resp. Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating. Polysomnographic examination in both patients revealed poor sleep with frequent changes of the sleep stages, with frequent awakenings, in both patients incl. even awakening from deep NREM sleep. The authors conclude that in these two patients NES with somnabulism is involved.",

      "title": "Bulimia Nervosa: A Psychological Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders are multifaceted mental health problems which require medical treatments and counseling from a psychological expert.In extreme condition,these eating disorders can cause serious health problems and may be lethal if these are not diagnosed and treated timely.Eating Disorder Hope organization has conducted a survey which revealed thatalmost 40% of teen age girls were suffering from at least one kind of eating disorder while91% of young females do dieting to reduce their weight. It has been estimated that about one million males and ten million females suffer from various types of eating disorders. &#x0D; Bulimia nervosa is one of the eating disorders. It oftens develops in teenage or early adulthood.It is common in women than men. In bulimia nervosa, a person usually eats a lot in a short period of time. It seems that the personcannot control himself fromeating food. It happens until they are painfully full and then they will purge to end their discomfort and to compensate their calories. They will purge by forced vomitinglaxatives,diuretics or excessive exercise.Frequent self-induced vomiting can contribute to inflammation of parotidgland and can result in hand calluses. It is more common in families appearing in generations.There are many risk factors for this disease like being overweight/obesity, socio-cultural pressures to have a well tonned body, psychological impacts resulting in stress and poor self-esteem. Dieting has become a part of our culture. There are manysymptoms of bulimia. For example, patients live in a fear of gaining weight, they go through the repeated episodes of abnormal eating large amounts of food in single sitting. There is a feeling which develops in patients that they cannot control what they eat and what type of food they eat, and after bingering they are forcing themselves to vomit and do more exercise to stop weight gain.&#x0D; If we leave bulimia untreated it will cause kidney problems, irregular heart rhythms, digestive issues and dental problems etc. In time treatment and diagnosis of bulimia helps the person to recover well and quick and the person can get rid of this disorder completely otherwise it can be life threatening. A person experiences bulimia to manage the emotional pain he is undergoing but it only worsens the condition and the response may be to ramp up obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Nearly half of bulimia patients have a co-occuring mood disorder and more than half of bulimia patients have co-occuring anxiety disorders. Self-harm is a common condition affecting 34% of those with bulimia. Recent studies on bulimia show that in 10-15% of male members of our society who are living with this disorder, risk of suicide has increased. Statistics show that relapse of this disorder isvery common.Relapse is occurring in about30-50% of the cases, and it isleading to common cause of death in suicide.For treatment of bulimia nervosa, you may need to go for several types. Bulimia can be reduced by taking anti-depressants or psychotherapy, but using both in combination is more fruitful to overcome this disorder. Psychotherapy is very important for patients, in which the person goes to the psychiatrist to discuss the issues related to bulimia. Educating the patient on nutrition also helps in this regard. Anutritionist can prescribe the food by which a person will feel the cravings for food to a lesser extent. In severe conditions,the patient can be admitted to a hospital because sometimes there is a need fortreatment in a hospital. In many cases it is not possible to eradicate it completely.But before the situation goes wrong, we can guide a person to lead a healthier life with the help of professionally used treatments. Since we are living in an era where everyone is busy, it is important to guide and educate the children about a healthy lifestyle. There is a need to give them confidence about their physical appearance, no matter what their weight, size and shape is. Enjoyable family meals should be arranged on daily basis or regularly. Talks on physical appearances, body weight and dieting should be discouraged at home. Exercise, walk, activities like sports and swimming can help young generation to adopt a healthy lifestyle and streamline their daily life. If you observe that someone in your friends or relatives is having issues related to food which is indicating thathe or she can possibly has an eating disorder, you should talk to the person supportively and discuss the issue and help them in any way you can before the situation gets worse.",

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

The effects of Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge eating disorder on immunity are less well studied. Patients with BN do not become as emaciated as patients with AN, but their weight often fluctuates >5 kg, due to the alternating binge eating and fasting or purging behaviour. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common in eating disorder patients, and in the majority of patients these persist even after the recovery from eating disorders, particularly in psychologically distressed patients.

      "abstract": "Anorexia is a severe psychological disorder in which a person's dieting turns into compulsive fasting. Some victims develop, after a time, a bulimic phase; their fasting is interrupted at intervals by bouts of indiscriminate gorging. One successful treatment makes use of a naturally occurring trance state, in which the anorexic's obsession with food recedes temporarily, to offer reassurance and rebuild a personality free of the obsession. The proposed model is catastrophe-theoretic. It assumes (a) that the bifurcation of eating attitudes typical of anorexia can be modeled by a cusp whose controls are hunger and eating regimen; and (b) that the normal cycle of falling asleep and waking up can be modeled by a hysteresis loop controlled by alertness. Catastrophe theory predicts two additional controls, and a larger model organized by the E6 singularity. The new controls are identified with loss of self-control and insecurity, and anorexia is correlated with high insecurity. The model makes the following predictions. First, under moderate levels of self-control and eating regimen, an anorexic has access to balanced, nonobsessive attitudes toward food at a reduced level of wakefulness. This is the trance state. Second, a healthy individual has two distinct sleep modes, dominated by cerebral and somatic elements, respectively. Third, with increasing insecurity the distinct modes fuse together, so that an anorexic's sleep patterns are abnormal. The model is geometric because the connection between behavior and controlling factors is made by graphs of certain standard form.",

Examples of inappropriate compensatory behaviors include self-induced vomiting, fasting, excessive exercise, and laxative or diuretic misuse. Additionally, patients with BN experience body image disturbance, where their self-evaluation is unduly affected by weight and body shape concerns. Bulimia nervosa typically begins in late adolescence or young adulthood. Patients either are typically of normal weight or are overweight. Physical examination and laboratory findings are typically normal; however, medical complications can include electrolyte disturbances, cardiac arrhythmia, and dental caries. Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat BN. A nutritional consultation is another important component of care. Finally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy are the psychotherapies of choice.",

Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are characterized by a severe disorder in eating behavior. They have been removed from the category of disorders first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence, where they were included in the previous versions of the DSM-IV (American Pyschiatric Association, 1994), and are now included in a specific diagnostic category. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by a refusal to mantain the body weight, associated with an extreme fear of becoming fat. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, or the use of laxatives and diuretics, or excessive exercise. Binge-eating disorder (BED), previously included in the eating disorders not otherwise specified (NOS), has more recently been considered a specific psychiatric diagnosis. It is characterized by uncontrolled binge eating without compensatory behaviors, both in obese and, more rarely, in non-obese individuals. When an eating disorder fails to meet diagnostic criteria for AN, BN, or BED, an eating disorder NOS is diagnosed. Among the clinical situations included in this category are anorexic behavior without amenorrhea or severe weight loss, with the current weight still in the normal range, bulimic behavior, with a low frequency of episodes (fewer than two per week for at least 3 months), and the compensatory behaviors (vomiting, exercise, laxatives) after a small amount of food has been eaten.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

Im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahre entwickelte sich bei der Patientin jeweils unmittelbar nach einer einwöchigen Hungerperiode eine akute paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose, die 3-mal stationär behandelt werden musste. Psychotische Prodromalsymptome waren vor und zu Beginn der Hungerzeit nicht eruierbar, so dass ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Hungern und der psychotischen Dekompensation gesehen werden kann. Anhand dieser Kasuistik wird die Hypothese diskutiert, dass während des Hungerns im Rahmen der Anorexia nervosa temporär eine Hyperaktivität des dopaminergen Systems entstehen könnte und dadurch der Übergang in eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose erklärbar wäre. Der Fall zeigt, dass bei vulnerablen Patienten mit einer ähnlichen Anamnese von einer Hungerkur oder anderen eingreifenden Diätmaßnahmen dringend abgeraten werden muss. Der Hinweis auf das erhöhte Psychoserisiko könnte so einen therapeutischen Nutzen für die Behandlung der Anorexia nervosa bei solchen Patienten haben.",

      "title": "What is sleep?",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

A clear definition has, however, recently been agreed.1 The Rome consensus states that symptoms should be chronic and recurring and consist of abdominal pain that is clearly related to bowel function, being either relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool with or without disturbed defecation, which is defined as two or more of the following: altered stool frequency, altered stool form (hard, loose, or watery), altered stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete defecation), and passage of mucus. The above symptoms are usually associated with bloating or a sense of abdominal distension. The syndrome excludes painless constipation and diarrhoea and also chronic abdominal pain that is unrelated to bowel movement in which psychiatric features predominate.\n\nIrritable bowel symptoms are experienced by 8-22% of the population,2 but most learn to cope with their symptoms and less than one third actually consult a doctor.

We studied the eating habits of 105 hospitalized female patients within the context of a prospective treatment study on anorexia nervosa: 53% had achieved weight loss by consistently fasting, whereas 47% periodically resorted to bulimia. The two groups were contrasted with regard to their developmental and psychosocial history, clinical characteristics, and psychiatric symptomatology. Fasting patients were more introverted, more often denied hunger, and displayed little overt psychic distress. In contrast, bulimic patients were more extroverted, admitted more frequently to a strong appetite and tended to be older. Vomiting was frequent, and kleptomania almost exclusively present in bulimic patients, who manifested greater anxiety, depression, guilt, interpersonal sensitivity, and had more somatic complaints. This association of bulimia with certain personality features and a distinct psychiatric symptomatology suggests that patients with bulimia form a subgroup among patients with anorexia nervosa.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

After exerting self-control, subsequent efforts at self-control are often relatively feeble and unsuccessful. The state of low willpower is called ego depletion. Studies on ego depletion have shown effects on intelligent thought (which is impaired during ego depletion), decision-making (depleted persons shift to more superficial ways of choosing, or prefer to avoid making choices), and passivity (depleted people become more passive). The psychological processes of self-regulation and ego depletion are linked to physical energy, as indicated by evidence that hunger makes people more short-sighted, and that food intake tends to counteract ego depletion. Depletion increases in response to interpersonal conflict, poor sleep, and confronting uncertainty. In daily life, good self-control is linked to avoiding problems and temptations, low stress, and higher happiness.",

The main diagnoses are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, in both of which there is an extreme concern with weight and shape. In anorexia nervosa, persistent dietary restriction leads to weight loss, which may be severe. In bulimia nervosa, the dietary restriction is interrupted by repeated episodes of binge eating (typically followed by self-induced vomiting) and weight is usually unremarkable. Both disorders may be accompanied by medical complications that present to physicians. Anorexia nervosa has the potential to be life-threatening because of the consequences of starvation. Patients may require medical attention for the correction of electrolyte disturbance and sometimes admission to a medical unit for refeeding. The main treatment of eating disorders is psychological. The prognosis of bulimia nervosa is generally good but is less positive for anorexia nervosa.",

A diagnosis of childhood abdominal epilepsy seems proper when recurrent abdominalgia lasts seconds or minutes and is accompanied by disturbance of awareness or responsiveness or by grand or petit mal seizures and electroencephalographic changes. These usually are controlled by treatment with diphenylhydantoin. Otherwise, some included cases differ. Febrile episodes lasted several days and recurred about weekly, biweekly, monthly, or irregularly for decades. Combinations of abdominalgia, stethalgia, or arthralgia with leukocytosis occurred. Electroencephalographic changes occasionally were abnormal; there were no epileptiform seizures and therapy had no effect.

As the disease progresses, patients may resist or be indifferent to eating, unable to properly absorb food when it's in the mouth (oral dysphagia) or aspirate when swallowing (pharyngeal dysphagia) [4, 5]. Such behavioral problems are perceived as a heavy burden by family caregivers, as they may experience stress, depression, and social isolation [2]. The purpose of this article is to study the general problems associated with nutrition, diet, nutritional regimen, and food intake observed in various clinical variants of dementia.",

      "title": "Etiology of constipation",
      "abstract": "Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered by physicians in their daily clinical practice. This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

People who suffer from insomnia may be unsatisfied with their sleep and exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: weariness, low energy, problems concentrating, mood swings, and poor work performance. Insomnia can be classified based on how long it lasts. Acute insomnia is a type of insomnia that lasts only a few hours and is caused by a variety of factors. Many people have had this form of temporary sleep disruption, which usually goes away without medication. Chronic insomnia is defined as sleep disruption that lasts at least three months and occurs at least three evenings per week. Insomnia can be caused by a variety of factors. Insomnia is caused by a misalignment of sleep-inducing neurotransmitters. The Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index are two methodologies and indices that have been used to research sleep disturbances in insomnia sufferers. Many medicines, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines, are used in the treatment, and drinking Melatonin-rich milk has also been found to be useful.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious illnesses affecting 1–2% of young women. Patients may present to any doctor, sometimes atypically (e.g. unexplained weight loss, food allergy, infertility, diarrhoea), delaying diagnosis and leading to needless investigation. The cardinal signs are weight loss, amenorrhoea, bingeing with vomiting and other compensatory behaviours, and disturbances in body image with an exaggeration of the importance of slimness. When other causes have been excluded, useful investigations are serum potassium, bone mineral density scanning and pelvic ultrasound. In emaciated patients multiple systems may fail with pancytopaenia, neuromyopathy and heart failure. Clinical assessment of muscle power is used to monitor physical risk. Treatment may involve individual, group or family sessions, using cognitive‐behavioural, psychodynamic and family approaches. More severe or intractable illness is treated with day care, with in‐patient care in a medical or specialist psychiatric unit reserved for the most severely ill patients. Antidepressants have a place in the treatment of bulimia nervosa unresponsive to psychological approaches, and when severe depressive symptoms develop. The children of people with eating disorders may have an increased risk of difficulties. Support for the patient and family, and effective liaison between professionals, are essential in the treatment of severe eating disorders.",

Consequently, an extinction schedule should reduce binge eating.Cue exposure was carried out with 6 bulimic women who had responded poorly or not at all to the usual pharmacologic or cognitive-behavioral treatments.Binge eating and vomiting were almost totally suppressed in the 6 patients. Symptom suppression was maintained at two follow-ups, one at 4-20 months and another at 2.5-3 years.Cue exposure may be effective with BN that is resistant to conventional treatments. The anxiety associated with food plays an important role in provoking and/or maintaining binge eating. Motivation to change is likely to be an important mediator.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

Following a recent stricter definition and classification, constipation and solitary encopresis are now recognised to be two separate entities. Constipation is characterised by infrequent defecation, often in combination with involuntary loss of faeces. Solitary encopresis most often occurs once a day after school hours. When there is no defecation, the frequency of encopresis increases, the abdominal pain becomes more severe and the appetite becomes less, until a large quantity of faeces is produced (often once per week). The physiology of the defecation and continence mechanism is complex and has only been unravelled in part. The multiple physiological mechanisms involved have a complementary and compensatory effect on each other. This makes it difficult to determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of these functional disorders.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

Here we report a case of an illiterate tribal woman who developed pica as the sole manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder, with onset during pregnancy. The patient had compulsions of eating uncooked rice or wheat, which resulted in toothache and abdominal discomfort. She had this habit in three pregnancies, consecutively. In the first two pregnancies it resolved spontaneously after puerperium, but persisted in the last one. Probably physical stress of limb edema during the third pregnancy was reason for the persistence. She responded to fluoxetine 40 mg / day after three months of treatment, without behavioral therapy. We conclude that pica may either be only a manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder during pregnancy or it is an obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder.",

      "abstract": "Nausea is an uneasy feeling in the stomach while vomiting refers to the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. Chronic nausea and vomiting represent a diverse array of disorders defined by 4 weeks or more of symptoms. Chronic nausea and vomiting result from a variety of pathophysiological processes, involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal causes. The prevalence of chronic nausea and vomiting is unclear, although the epidemiology of specific conditions, such as gastroparesis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, is better understood. The economic impact of chronic nausea and vomiting and effects on quality of life are substantial. The initial diagnostic evaluation involves distinguishing gastrointestinal causes of chronic nausea and vomiting (e.g., gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome) from nongastrointestinal causes (e.g., medications, vestibular, and neurologic disorders). After excluding anatomic, mechanical and biochemical causes of chronic nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal causes can be grouped into two broad categories based on the finding of delayed, or normal, gastric emptying. Non-gastrointestinal disorders can also cause chronic nausea and vomiting. As a validated treatment algorithm for chronic nausea and vomiting does not exist, treatment should be based on a thoughtful discussion of benefits, side effects, and costs. The objective of this monograph is to review the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting, emphasizing common gastrointestinal causes.",

A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

      "abstract": "El denominado Trastorno de la ingestion alimentaria de la infancia o ninez recogido en el DSM-IV-TR (1), se define como “Una alteracion de la alimentacion mani-festada por una dificultad persistente para comer adecua-damente, con incapacidad para aumentar de peso o con perdidas significativas de peso durante por lo menos un mes” ademas su inicio debe ser anterior a los seis anos de edad. Abarca una serie de conductas disfuncionales relacionadas con la ingestion alimentaria como pueden ser: tragar sin masticar la comida, negarse a comer, vomitar la comida o masticar con excesiva lentitud. Es-tos tipos de problemas angustian a los padres de manera desmesurada en muchas ocasiones. Con cierta frecuencia no saben como abordarlo, con lo que intentan multiples maneras de solucionarlo, entre las que se encuentran un peregrinaje por distintos especialistas y la consecuente realizacion de multiples pruebas medicas asi como una medicalizacion innecesaria, que en la mayoria de las oca-siones resultan infructuosas.Esta problematica es bastante frecuente en la infancia. Manikam y Perman (2) afirman que mas del 25 por ciento de los ninos presentan conductas dificiles relacionadas con la alimentacion, llegando hasta el 80 por ciento en ninos con dificultades ambientales. En un estudio llevado a cabo en Londres (3) con ninos de tres anos de edad, se encontro que el 16 por ciento mostraba, poco apetito y el 12 por ciento eran caprichosos con los alimentos. No se encontraron diferencias entre sexos. Los problemas se mantuvieron en dos tercios de los ninos al ano siguiente y en un tercio tres anos despues.Normalmente este tipo de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria requiere de dos tipos de intervenciones es-pecificas: 1. La instauracion de habitos alimentarios “adecua-dos” y su mantenimiento. Cambiando el patron relacional que se establece entre el nino y el cui-dador principal durante el acto de la alimentacion.2. Modificacion de las creencias de los padres acerca de la alimentacion del nino (4). En muchas ocasio-nes el problema se situa en creencias erroneas por parte de los padres acerca de lo que es adecuado o no comer o sobre la idea de delgadez.Este tipo de patologias alimentarias normalmente no suponen un riesgo vital para el menor, pero si pueden ocasionar diferentes desajustes en el desarrollo person-al y en la propia configuracion de la dinamica familiar. Asi en muchos hogares son motivo de discusion entre los progenitores, de disputas entre padres e hijos y de desacuerdo entre distintos miembros del clan familiar configurando un ambiente propicio para la aparicion de nuevos problemas de indole conductual, fisiologica o emocional.Chambless y Ollendick (5) recogen los tratamientos psicologicos empiricamente validados establecidos por los grupos de trabajo de la Task Force de la APA. Den-tro de los problemas pediatricos, y mas concretamente de los alimentarios, Kerwin (6) establece que el unico tratamiento empiricamente validado para los trastornos severos de alimentacion es la terapia de conducta.",

      "title": "Food Refusal: A Sign of Nausea?",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Food refusal and failure to thrive are serious problems in young children. When accompanied by ejection of previously swallowed food, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is often suspected. The rationale is that reflux oesophagitis causes pain related to feedings and avoidance of feeds occurs in order to minimize the unpleasant experience (1). Such children, although hungry and eager to take the bottle at the beginning of the meal, subsequently become unsettled and irritable and push the bottle away. They often improve with anti-reflux measures such as antacids or histamine2 receptor antagonists (2). Another potential cause of food refusal and ejection of feeds is the nausea and vomiting caused by activation of the emetic reflex. Activation of the emetic reflex is associated with autonomic prodromal symptoms such as nausea, followed by retching and vomiting caused by forceful contraction of the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall muscles (2). In this situation, food refusal might be an indicator of antecedent nausea. This possibility was investigated in the current study by examining the relationship between food refusal and symptoms of the emetic reflex. METHODS We used a structured interview in a prospective study of children scheduled for fundoplication to record symptoms associated with feeding and vomiting. The study included 20 neurologically impaired (age range, 3 months–8 years) and 11 neurologically normal (age range, 3 months—4 years) patients. The presence or absence of food refusal (distinct from dysphagia) was recorded in each patient. The children were divided into two groups according to whether their vomiting symptoms were typical of GORD (Group A: effortless regurgitation and/or possetting) or typical of activation of the emetic reflex (Group B: retching and forceful emesis). Groups were compared using Fisher exact test. RESULTS Pre-operatively, food refusal was more common in Group B than Group A and there was a significant association between food refusal and retching (Table 1, P < 0.01). The presence of preoperative food refusal was a strong predictor of postoperative retching in that 9 of 11 food refusers retched after fundoplication compared with 5 of 20 nonrefusers (P < 0.01).TABLE 1: The presence of symptoms of retching and of food refusal in a group of 31 children (20 neurologically impaired and 11 neurologically normal). There is a significant association between food refusal and retching, p < 0.01DISCUSSION Retching is caused by activation of the emetic reflex and usually is preceded by nausea and other autonomic prodromal features such as sweating and pallor due to peripheral vasoconstriction (2). Nausea is a very unpleasant sensation (2), perhaps a more aversive experience even than pain (3). Nausea is part of the defensive role of the emetic reflex. It facilitates the conditioning that results in subsequent avoidance of foods that previously caused illness. The role of learned food aversion is particularly apparent in animals unable to vomit, such as the rat. This conditioned food avoidance makes the rat a difficult animal to poison (2). Many chemotherapeutic agents used to treat malignancies are strongly emetogenic. Their repeated administration to children or adults in association with food may render those foods unpalatable to the patient. Such conditioning may result in specific food refusal behaviors (4,5). Young children and the neurologically impaired are unable to verbalize their feelings and experiences. Instead, in a fashion similar to experimental animals (6), they change their behavior in response to negative experiences. They avoid what they perceive to be the stimulus for nausea by refusing feedings. They may become distressed when they see specific foods prepared and may have an aversion to the bottle. The behavior is easily misinterpreted as oppositional or lazy. Many children with chronic vomiting have features such as sweating, pallor, and retching suggesting that their symptoms are in fact caused by activation of the emetic reflex and not by the regurgitation of GORD (7). It follows that such children would not improve with medical antireflux therapy and many indeed receive antireflux surgery. Fundoplication may physically prevent vomiting, but the emetic reflex is still activated and these children may continue to retch postoperatively (7). Food refusal may be difficult to identify in severely neurologically impaired children, and its incidence underestimated because of other factors such as dysphagia. However, it may still be apparent to careful observers. We recall the mother of an infant with spastic quadriplegia who described her child as \"only happy when she is being fasted for a test.\" The child's retching and vomiting improved following treatment with the anti-emetic metoclopramide. A previous retrospective study of 600 children younger than 2 years with GORD reported that 25 had food refusal Thirteen of these had fundoplications to control vomiting (8). The prevalence of oesophagitis was no greater in the refusers than in nonrefusers, but all the food refusers experienced postoperative retching, implying that the emetic reflex was activated and suggesting that food refusal was a consequence of nausea caused by activation of the emetic reflex rather than pain from oesophagitis. This study is consistent with our findings of an association between food refusal and retching after fundoplication. The association between food refusal and retching suggests that, in these children, food refusal in association with the ejection of gastric contents may be a consequence of activation of the emetic reflex and nausea, rather than a consequence of GORD and oesophagitis. Unpleasant experiences after food ingestion may lead to food avoidance. The response to nausea is qualitatively different from other noxious experiences in both humans and animals. It results in food/taste aversion (rather than simple avoidance), whereas heartburn (a classic symptom of GORD), bloating, and electric shock do not. Food aversion is a behavior which takes much longer to extinguish (3). A single pairing of a food with a nauseating experience has been shown sufficient to produce aversion (5,9) that may persist for years. These observations have implications for management. These children may not be helped by antireflux medication or by antireflux surgery. Surgery may in fact make make symptoms worse because the children can no longer vomit. They may not be cured by behavioral therapy, and tube feeds may accentuate nausea and exacerbate symptoms. Investigation may show that some of them have a treatable cause for their emesis (e.g., cow's milk protein intolerance). In others, a specific cause will not be found. Some may have a form of functional dyspepsia or visceral afferent hypersensitivity. Others (especially the overtly neurologically impaired), may have a central nervous system disturbance (e.g., loss or dysfunction of central inhibitory emetic pathways). The treatment for these children should be anti-emetic strategies (7). Acknowledgments: The authors thank Professor Spitz and Professor Milla for permission to report their patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "The network therapy approach can be useful in addressing a broad range of patients with addictions characterized by the following clinical hallmarks of substance use disorder: First, when they initiate consumption of their addictive agent, be it alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or depressant drugs, they frequently cannot limit that consumption to a reasonable and predictable level; this phenomenon has been termed \"loss of control\" by clinicians who treat persons dependent on alcohol or drugs. Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years).

      "title": "Restlessness and an Increased Urge to Move (Drive for Activity) in Anorexia Nervosa May Strengthen Personal Motivation to Maintain Caloric Restriction and May Augment Body Awareness and Proprioception: A Lesson From Leptin Administration in Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN), a disorder of voluntary food restriction leading to severe weight loss in female adolescents, remains an enigma. In particular, the appropriation of the starved thin body into the self-concept in AN is a process insufficiently researched and still poorly understood. Healthy humans undergoing starvation experience a slowing of movements and avoid voluntary exercise. By contrast, AN tends to be not infrequently associated with voluntary, sometimes excessive and/or compulsive exercise. Such deliberate exercise, not reported in starvation, seems to be facilitated by an increased urge for movement and physical restlessness, particular to AN. The increased urge to move would reflect spontaneous daily activity, the energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or voluntary exercise. Our hypothesis is that the starvation-induced increased urge to move and restlessness may promote the development of AN. Reversal of the fasting state, by either high caloric food or by leptin administration, would be expected to reduce restlessness and the increased urge to move along with improvement in other symptoms in AN. This review explores the idea that such restless activation in AN, in itself and through accelerating body weight loss, might foster the integration of the starving body into the self-concept by (1) enhancing the person’s sense of self-control and sense of achievement and (2) through invigorating proprioception and through intensifying the perception of the changing body shape. (3) Tentative evidence from studies piloting leptin administration in chronic AN patients which support this hypothesis is reviewed. The findings show that short term administration of high doses of leptin indeed mitigated depressive feelings, inner tension, intrusive thoughts of food, and the increased urge to be physically active, easing the way to recovery, yet had little influence on the patients’ personal commitment to remain at a low weight. Full recovery then requires resolution of the individuals’ personal unresolved psychological conflicts through psychotherapy and frequently needs specialized treatment approaches to address psychiatric co-morbidities. AN might be conceptualized as a hereditary form of starvation resistance, facilitated by the effects of starvation on fitness allowing for an exceptionally intense personal commitment to perpetuate food restriction.",

They have difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep and believe they will not be able to fall asleep unless they eat. Individuals with NES frequently experience significant mental distress and a worsening of mood in the evening. NES generally begins in early adulthood, although it may start during the teenage years. It is a long-standing problem for individuals. Symptoms may worsen with stressful life circumstances. Prognosis is dependent on accurately diagnosing the NES along with any coexisting disorders. The relationship between sleep disorders and eating behaviors is of considerable scientific interest and an area of active investigation and evolving conceptualization. Patients with NES eat most of their calories after the evening meal. They eat “in order to sleep”, and each eating episode is generally shorter and involves fewer calories.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Transient Epileptic Amnesia Triggered by Eating: A Case of Reflex Temporal Lobe Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background: Reflex epilepsies are characterized by seizures triggered by specific stimuli such as light, stress, or eating. Recent research suggests a continuum between reflex and spontaneous seizures. Eating epilepsy, where eating triggers seizures, is a complex condition often seen in individuals with other types of epilepsy. This case report is novel as it describes transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) induced by eating, a previously unreported phenomenon. This report adds to the sparse literature on reflex eating epilepsy and TEA by detailing the patient’s seizure semiology and electroencephalographic findings. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old left-handed female with a family history of epilepsy began experiencing seizures in January 2023. Her seizures, mostly triggered by eating, are preceded by a change in taste and an indescribable aura. During seizures, she becomes forgetful and confused, giving inappropriate responses without losing consciousness or showing motor manifestations. The seizures, lasting less than a minute, occur weekly despite treatment with levetiracetam and lamotrigine. Her brain MRI was normal, and a routine EEG showed frequent left temporal sharp waves without ictal events. During an EMU admission, interictal EEG showed frequent sharp waves over the left temporal region. She had four clinical seizures with left temporal onset, all provoked by eating. She experienced parageusia at seizure onset, followed by an inability to name food or objects, but could speak and follow commands, excluding ictal aphasia. Postictally, she recalled all events. All seizures were recorded off antiseizure medications. Conclusions This case highlights the novel presentation of TEA induced by eating, expanding the understanding of reflex epilepsies. The detailed seizure semiology and EEG findings contribute to the sparse literature on this condition, emphasizing the need for further research into the mechanisms and management of reflex eating epilepsy and TEA.",

In AN, there is an inexplicable fear of weight gain and unrelenting obsession with fatness even in the face of increasing cachexia. Bulimia nervosa usually emerges after a period of dieting, which may or may not have been associated with weight loss. Binge eating is followed by either self-induced vomiting or some other means of compensation for the excess of food ingested. Most people with BN have irregular feeding patterns and satiety may be impaired. Although abnormally low body weight is an exclusion for the diagnosis of BN, some 25% to 30% of bulimics presenting to treatment centers have a prior history of AN; however, all bulimics have pathological concern with weight and shape. Common to individuals with AN or BN are low selfesteem, depression, and anxiety.",

Se presenta a edades tempranas, siendo mas grave cuanto menor sea la edad del nino. \nEl Deficit de Atencion se manifiesta en la dificultad para mantener la atencion en una sola tarea durante el tiempo suficiente, \nel nino parece no escuchar cuando se le habla directamente, no sigue instrucciones y no finaliza las tareas, tiene dificultades \nde organizacion, se resiste a dedicarse a tareas que requieren un esfuerzo mental, extravia objetos necesarios para tareas \no actividades, se distrae facilmente con estimulos irrelevantes y descuido en las actividades diarias. \nLa hiperactividad se observa por la dificultad para permanecer sentado, movimiento excesivo de manos o pies, correr o \nsaltar excesivamente en situaciones que es inapropiado hacerlo, dificultades para jugar o dedicarse tranquilamente a \nactividades de ocio y hablar en exceso. \nLa impulsividad aparece en sintomas como respuestas precipitadas antes de haber sido completadas las preguntas, tiene \ndificultades para guardar turno, interrumpe o se inmiscuye en las actividades de otros y movimientos bruscos, poco \nprecisos. \nEstos comportamientos interfieren en todos los ambitos de la vida. En el medio escolar puede observarse un bajo \nrendimiento academico, siendo muy alto el riesgo de fracaso escolar y de inadaptacion. En el medio social presentan un \ndeficit en la puesta en marcha de habilidades sociales adecuadas. Y en el medio familiar sus conductas disruptivas pueden \nllegar a deteriorar las relaciones ya que sus padres no entienden que esta sucediendo ni como corregirlo.",

Individuals suffering from BN usually report feeling anxious or depressed before the onset of their eating problems, and disordered eating may represent an attempt to cope with negative emotion. The anxiety associated with BN may arise from several pathways including body dissatisfaction, idealized images of thinness, and negative life events (Polivy & Herman, 2002). There are also other factors that contribute",

Most healthy individuals reflux gastric contents into their esophagus, and this is called physiological reflux. These episodes occur in the postprandial period; are short lived; rarely cause other symptoms; and almost never occur at night.In contrast, another kind of GER is called pathological GER, and this causes other symptoms and diseases.The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function contributes largely to GER.The mechanisms of GER can be classified into three types: 1) the transient LES relaxation; 2) intraabdominal pressure transients, and 3) spontaneous free GER.The first is usually observed in healthy subjects. The latter two mechanisms are associated with a low resting LES pressure.Pathological GER includes a high rate in the latter two mechanisms.GER increases postprandially, possibly secondary to gastric distention.",

      "abstract": "Although the majority of patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa develop these disorders in their teens and 20s, some patients develop an eating disorder in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. We present a subgroup of patients with the following pattern of symptoms and historical detail: (1) severe sexual and physical abuse by family members; (2) relatively good premorbid professional and marital adjustment (considering later difficulties) though characterized by (3) hypomania, binge eating, and morbid obesity. A pronounced shift in eating behaviors follows (4) medical trauma (e.g., injury, cancer, surgery) that occurs after age 30, interrupts previous hypomanic adaptation, and leads to severe restriction, purging, and dramatic weight loss (e.g., 100 lb). Although only one patient met full criteria for anorexia nervosa, weight loss and starvation were serious enough to provoke further medical crises in all patients. Finally, (5) during both weight loss and weight restoration patients demonstrated significant dissociative disturbance, including dissociated mood and personality states (i.e., multiple personality disorder), self-destructive behavioral episodes repeating early trauma, and avoidance of food as a way to manage PTSD symptoms. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

Symptomatic behaviors too quickly get entrenched and need to be urgently addressed. Particularly with the eating-disordered teen, treatment goals must include immediate intervention with eating behaviors while, at the same time, attempting to reach the disowned part of the patient, often hidden behind bingeing, purging, or other disordered behaviors. This work involves an expansion of the unwitting but often hierarchical structure of contemporary treatment. Understanding dissociation as an interpersonal enactment as opposed to developmental impairment allows patient and therapist to work in tandem to search for the parts of the patient hidden behind food and weight obsessions. The goal is not merely symptom reduction but also to find the part of the patient who is reluctant to enter the room.",

Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

      "abstract": "One of the most frequent motivations for seeking veterinary attention for a cat is when the owner recognises a loss of normal appetite in his pet. The medical term for a lack of appetite for food is ‘anorexia’, and it may be partial or complete. While anorexia is a common manifestation of disease, the mechanisms underlying decreased food intake are complex and not completely understood. The regulation of appetite involves interaction of external stimuli with signals from the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Aberrations in any of the internal control systems for hunger and satiety, or changes in external factors such as diet or feeding environment, can result in partial or total anorexia. The challenge for the practitioner is not only to diagnose and treat the underlying condition, but to recognise at what point inadequate food intake has or will impinge on the patient's nutritional status to the extent that it might deleteriously affect clinical outcome. It is also important to bear in mind the significance that the patient's appetite and food intake has for the cat owner in his overall perception of his pet's condition and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Clients suffering from the fasting and gorging syndromes of anorexia and bulimia nervosa are at significant risk of self-harm even if treated with apparent success in hospital. Two major issues (not inevitably co-existing) appear to be at work in these illnesses; distorted perception by the sufferer of his or her own body appearance and stressful interpersonal relationships originating in one of a variety of groups of which the sufferer is a member. (Fear of psychosexual maturity, that is, the clients' inability to develop an age-appropriate sexual identity, is treated in this paper as being the product of faulty interactional patterns; it is also a less clear-cut issue in bulimia nervosa than in anorexia.) A supervised hospital in-patient treatment regime concentrating upon weight gain, effective discouragement of purgation and vomiting, possible drug treatment and perhaps dual or independent usage of individual or group psychotherapy with focused cognitive-behavioural task-oriented approaches, will not realize effective change unless these issues are resolved. Community psychiatric nurses (CPNs) are well-placed to observe and supervise people with eating disorders who are potentially vulnerable to relapse following discharge from hospital. Strategies for effective CPN interventions in the community care of anorectic and bulimic clients are suggested in the paper.",

Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders.

      "title": "Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a condition in which affected individuals may experience paralytic episodes with concomitant hypokalemia (serum potassium Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. Additional triggers can include cold, stress/excitement/fear, salt intake, prolonged immobility, use of glucosteroids or alcohol, and anesthetic procedures. The age of onset of the first attack ranges from two to 30 years; the duration of paralytic episodes ranges from one to 72 hours with an average of nearly 24 hours. Long-lasting interictal muscle weakness may occur in some affected individuals and in some stages of the disease and in myopathic muscle changes. A myopathy may occur independent of paralytic symptoms and may be the sole manifestation of hypoPP. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypoPP is established in a proband who meets the consensus diagnostic criteria based on a history of attacks of muscle weakness associated with documented serum potassium In the case of long-lasting interictal flaccid muscle weakness, imaging techniques can inform on the pathogenesis, potential therapy, and prognosis. Muscle ultrasound and muscle 1H-MRI are reliable image techniques with high accuracy for the disease. The weakness can be caused by edemas, fatty muscle degeneration, and muscle atrophy or a combination of these pathologies. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment varies depending on the intensity and duration of the paralytic attack. Minor attacks may resolve spontaneously. Moderate attacks may be self-treated in a non-medical setting by ingestion of oral potassium salts. Severe attacks typically require more intensive medical management with intravenous potassium infusion, serial measurement of serum potassium concentration, clinical evaluation of possible respiratory involvement, and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. There is no known curative treatment for hypoPP-related myopathy; physiotherapy may help to maintain strength and motor skills. Prevention of primary manifestations. The goal of preventive treatment is to reduce the frequency and intensity of paralytic attacks. This may be achieved by avoidance of triggering factors, adherence to a diet low in sodium and carbohydrate and rich in potassium, and with the use of oral potassium supplementation. If dietary intervention and oral potassium supplementation are not effective in preventing attacks, treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) may be necessary. If carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not tolerated or not effective after prolonged use, alternatives include potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Prevention of secondary complications. Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical; an affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance and companions must be informed of the risk in order to enable rapid treatment. Anesthetic complications should be prevented by strict control of serum potassium concentration, avoidance of large glucose and salt load, maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance, and careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function. It is unknown whether prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with hypoPP who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported. Surveillance. The frequency of consultations is adapted to the individual's signs/symptoms and response to preventive treatment. Periodic neurologic examination with attention to muscle strength in the legs should be performed to detect long-lasting weakness associated with myopathy. For those taking acetazolamide, the following are indicated every three months: complete blood count; electrolytes; and glucose, uric acid, and liver enzyme levels. Renal ultrasound should be performed annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Factors that trigger paralytic attacks (e.g., unusually strenuous effort, carbohydrate-rich meals or sweets, cold, stress/excitement/fear, high salt intake, prolonged immobility, oral or intravenous glucosteroids, certain anesthetic procedures, alcohol) should be avoided when possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk. When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members can identify those at risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or possible anesthetic complications. Genetic counseling HypoPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with hypoPP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance is about 90% in males and reduced in females. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Najczęściej objawy te są powiązane z zaburzeniami motoryki przewodu pokarmowego.

Depresija, anksioznoist, mržnja prema vlastitom tijelu, nedostatak\nsamopouzdanja, psiholoska su stanja koja su prisutna kod osoba koje boluju\nod poremecaja prehrane. Lijecenje takvih bolesnika je dugotrajno i\npredstavlja multidisciplinaran pristup. Bulimija je poremecaj vezan uz\nhranjenje koji je, kao i anoreksija nervoza, psiholoskog podrijetla, a može\nimati strasne tjelesne posljedice. Dok se anoreksicari jednostavno\nizgladnjuju, bulimicari se „ciste“ povracanjem koje su sami izazvali. Oboljeli\nod bulimije također cesto koriste tablete za mrsavljenje, laksative i diuretike\nda bi smanjili težinu. Za razliku od anoreksicnih osoba najcesce su normalne\ngrađe, nekada cak i krupniji, dok su u kombinaciji s anoreksijom esktremno\nmrsavi. Ciscenje može imati dvije svrhe: sprecavanje dobivanja na težini i\nprivremeno ublažavanje depresije i ostalih negativnih osjecaja .Bulimija\npoput anoreksije, pogađa uglavnom mlade žene. Može se javiti sama za\nsebe ili naizmjenice s anoreksijom. Unatoc preklapanju, ova dva poremecaja\npovezuju se s nekim razlicitim crtama licnosti: anoreksicari su skloni\npotiskivanju svojih poriva, ukljucujuci spolne; oboljeli od bulimije, s druge\nstrane, obicno udovoljavaju svojim žudnjama, prenagljujuci se, upadajuci u\nnevolje s drogom, promiskuitetnim ponasanjem, krađom po trgovinama ili\nnekontroliranim kupovanjem. Bulimija je prava bolest i osobe oboljele od nje\nobicno je ne mogu voljno kontrolirati bez strucne pomoci. Anoreksija nervoza\nje poremecaj jedenja u sredistu kojeg se nalazi preplavljujuci strah od\ndebljanja. Ne nastaje zbog gubitka apetita vec je rijec o borbi protiv gladi\nzbog stalno prisutnog i potpuno nerazumnog straha od debljanja koji ne\npopusta ni onda kad je mrsavost dostigla takve razmjere da je ugrožen život\nbolesnika/ce. Iako je u sredistu bolesti hrana, anoreksija je bolest uma.

Nurses working permanent night shifts may have major disturbances in their daytime sleep especially in the duration of sleep which is much less than that of night sleep, and this may be due to attending to essential daytime necessities (e.g. cooking, feeding, shopping and spending time with family). Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2]. Nurses working permanent night shifts frequently lament about problems in commencing and/or sustaining sleep, as well as a decline in sleep duration [3]. A relative analysis of nurses working night shifts and those working day shifts revealed that night shift nurses had poorer...",

      "abstract": "Sedentary behaviour refers to certain activities in a reclining, seated or lying position requiring very low energy expenditure. It has been suggested to be distinct from physical inactivity and an independent predictor of metabolic risk even if an individual meets current physical activity guidelines. Over the past decades, a shift in the activity profile of individuals has been observed with vigorous physical activity and sleep being partly replaced by cognitive work, a potential neurogenic stress component considering its hormonal and neurophysiological effects, leading to various impacts on health. Mental work, for instance, may significantly increase glycemic instability leading to an increase in the desire to eat and thus, higher energy intakes. Furthermore, screen-based leisure activities (e.g. television watching) and screen-based work activities (e.g. computer use for work purposes) have often been considered together while they may not trigger the same stress response and/or use of substrate. Thus, the problems of sedentariness may not only be attributed to a lack of movement, but also to the stimulation provided by replacing activities. The objective of this review is to discuss the 1) recent evidence and current state of knowledge regarding the health impact of sedentary behaviours on health; 2) potential neurogenic effects of cognitive work as a sedentary behaviour; 3) link between sedentary behaviours and the diet; 4) resemblance between sedentary behaviours and the inadequate sleeper; and 5) potential solutions to reduce sedentary behaviours and increase physical activity.",

The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders. Since he did not respond to other treatments, we decided to try therapy with topiramate; as a result, the episodes disappeared, tolerance was excellent and effectiveness was maintained throughout the two years' follow-up.In this paper we review eating disorders that occur during sleep, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder and its therapeutic possibilities, while highlighting the usefulness of topiramate to treat this condition.",

      "abstract": "A brief history of a patient is given and an attempt is made to reconcile the clinical realities she presents with the various diagnostic criteria that have been proposed for eating disorders. Despite much deliberation and many formulations, no scheme fully encompasses her not-uncommon problem. Rather than tinker yet again with the criteria for the syndromes of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, or introduce yet another new condition such as binge eating disorder, the authors suggest a unitary approach to diagnosis. Emphasis should be placed on the preoccupation with weight loss, the illness should be conceptualized as a dieting disorder rather than an eating disorder, and patient status should be accorded only when the disturbance results in significant psychological or physical ill-effects. The term anorexia nervosa should be retained for such cases, and all anorexia nervosa patients should be categorized on three parameters, viz: their current state of nutrition; the presence or absence of significant purging behaviors; and whether or not they have binge eating episodes. © 1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "title": "Neuroleptics and operant behavior: The anhedonia hypothesis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuroleptic drugs disrupt the learning and performance of operant habits motivated by a variety of positive reinforcers, including food, water, brain stimulation, intravenous opiates, stimulants, and barbiturates. This disruption has been demonstrated in several kinds of experiments with doses that do not significantly limit normal response capacity. With continuous reinforcement neuroleptics gradually cause responding to cease, as in extinction or satiation. This pattern is not due to satiation, however, because it also occurs with nonsatiating reinforcement (such as saccharin or brain stimulation). Repeated tests with neuroleptics result in earlier and earlier response cessation reminiscent of the kind of decreased resistance to extinction caused by repeated tests without the expected reward. Indeed, withholding reward can have the same effect on responding under later neuroleptic treatment as prior experience with neuroleptics themselves; this suggests that there is a transfer of learning (really unlearning) from nonreward to neuroleptic conditions. These tests under continuous reinforcement schedules suggest that neuroleptics blunt the ability of reinforcers to sustain responding at doses which largely spare the ability of the animal to initiate responding. Animals trained under partial reinforcement, however, do not respond as well during neuroleptic testing as animals trained under continuous reinforcement. Thus, neuroleptics can also impair responding (though not response capacity ) that is normally sustained by environmental stimuli (and associated expectancies) in the absence of the primary reinforcer. Neuroleptics also blunt the euphoric impact of amphetamine in humans. These data suggest that the most subtle and interesting effect of neuroleptics is a selective attenuation of motivational arousal which is (a) critical for goal-directed behavior, (b) normally induced by reinforcers and associated environmental stimuli, and (c) normally accompanied by the subjective experience of pleasure. Because these drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and because they cause parkinsonian-like side effects, this action has implications for a better understanding of human pathology as well as normal motivational processes.",

      "title": "Positive Emotion Dysregulation in Eating Disorders and Obesity",
      "abstract": "Individuals diagnosed with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder often experience a great deal of suffering and persistent reoccurrence of symptoms and engage in suicidal and self-harming behaviors. The bulk of psychological research on eating disorders has historically focused primarily on the experience of negative emotion, which has been well established as a problem across the eating disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that positive emotion dysregulation may also play an important and underappreciated role in eating disorders. The positive emotion dysregulation in eating disorders can take various forms, resulting in either a dearth of positive emotional experience or maladaptive elevations in positive emotion. Some eating-disordered behaviors, such as binge eating, may result in momentary elevations in positive emotion, while others, such as purging, may ameliorate negative emotion and simultaneously promote positive emotions such as relief. In contrast, anorexia nervosa is a disorder frequently characterized by rigid self-control; a growing body of evidence suggests that many anorexia nervosa weight loss behaviors may facilitate the experience and control of positive emotion. Importantly, the experiences of both negative and positive emotion dysregulation may contribute to challenges faced in treating eating disorders and issues with recurrence of symptoms, particularly for anorexia nervosa. Finding alternative methods for facilitating positive emotion in an adaptive manner may be critical for improving current eating disorder treatments. Thus, positive emotion dysregulation may contribute to both onset and maintenance of eating disorders; addressing these issues may provide a promising future direction for improving clinical interventions for eating disorders.",

Increased energy intake and diminished satiety signalling can be seen in the case of overweight and obesity. On the other hand, decreased energy intake and increased satiety can be seen in the ageing population, also known as anorexia of ageing. Furthermore, abnormal sensations such as recurring pain, stress, and anxiety can influence energy intake and satiety signalling. This in turn can result in food intake disorders such as avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Administering tastants, especially bitter tastants, in the gastrointestinal tract can result in decreased energy intake. Intragastric administration of lidocaine did not result in increased energy intake.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysphagia refers to the feeling of difficulty in passing food or liquid from the mouth to the stomach and requires rapid neuromuscular coordination not only of the esophagus but also structures in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx during a brief cessation of respiration. The swallowing mechanism can be separated into three stages: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Disabilities resulting directly from dysphagia may arise secondary to aspiration, and the ongoing risk of aspiration has several consequences: limited oral intake of solid food and liquids, restriction of the diet (eg, to foods of a certain consistency), need for assistance when eating, and discomfort associated with eating. Evaluation usually includes assessment by a speech-language pathologist and often is supplemented by a modified barium swallow or a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment describes the process for evaluating impairment for dysphagia in Chapter 4, The Nervous System, Chapter 9, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures, and Chapter 10, The Digestive System. Section 9.3b, Mastication and Deglutition, includes information about the relationship of dietary restrictions to permanent impairment. Impairment for dysphagia is determined by considering the underlying cause for the dysphagia, dietary restrictions, feeding requirements, and complications.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders, especially bulimia, are considered to be the most sensitive barometer of the process of Westernisation and (partly for this reason) cultural, family and psychological factors seem to play a key role in their aetiology. The increase in their frequency can be linked with the significance that is ascribed to the body and eating in Western culture. Viewed from the psychodynamic perspective, eating disorders are treated as a formed by a culture symptomatic manifestation of dysfunction of very varied personality, neurotic and prepsychotic mechanisms. They are expressed through a person's attitude to their own body and eating. The relation between the body and food may be treated as a metaphor of the relation of the female patient with various aspects of herself and significant persons in her life. The mechanisms of arising of psychological bulimia and anorexia are convergent in this model. Differences in the clinical picture are linked with the strength of mechanisms of control. In the case of anorexia nervosa restrictive type, we are dealing with complete control over the body and eating as an expression of denial of various desires and impulses. In the case of bulimia nervosa and bulimic symptoms in anorexia nervosa, we observe the occurrence of alternate yielding to desires and impulses in the act of eating and a denial of yielding to them in vomiting and other compensatory behaviours. An attempt to understand the links between the individual bulimic psychopathology of the patient and functioning of the family system constitutes an important supplement to the above theories. Many authors draw attention to the similarity of functioning of families with anorexia and bulimia. Open and stormy expression of tension is typical for bulimic families, as are various traumas concerning children. The conceptions presented above should be considered to have practical significance in the course of therapy rather than as exhaustive descriptions of all determinants of eating disorders.",

In the acute situation it may be a medical emergency; when it becomes chronic it can become an ingrained behavior that is difficult to change.

Tube-feeding is an effective short-term intervention that can be discontinued when the patient re-starts oral intake. However, in some situations patients may become dependent on the use of tube-feeding. We present a case report of a patient with schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline intelligence, and seizure disorder who was tube-fed by his family members for more than three years because he refused to eat orally. 在许多精神障碍中（包括强迫症和精神分裂症），拒食是常见的表现。当突然出现拒食时，这可能需要急诊处理；一旦变成慢性，它就成为一种难以改变的根深蒂固的行为。对拒食患者的诊断可能有难度，尤其是对有共病问题、智力受损或对自身状况缺乏自知力的患者。鼻饲是一种有效的短期干预方法，当患者重新进食时即可中止这一干预。然而，在某些情况下，患者可能变得依赖于鼻饲。我们介绍一个病例，报告一名患有精神分裂症、强迫症、边缘智力以及癫痫的患者由于拒绝进食而由其家庭成员用鼻饲管喂食超过三年。.本文全文中文版从2015年10月26日起在http://dx.doi.org/ htp://dx.doi.org/10.11919/j.issn.1002-0829.215013可供免费阅览下载.",

      "title": "[Role of deglutitive inhibition in the pathophysiology of esophageal primary motor disorders].",
      "abstract": "The esophageal primary motor disorders like achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm or the nutcracker can involve the upper esophageal sphincter, the esophageal body, the lower esophageal sphincter or a combination of them. This article will focus on the esophageal body and abnormal peristalsis. A normal esophageal peristaltic contraction occurs after a latency period following a swallow and requires a minimum amplitude to be propulsive. Abnormal latencies may generate simultaneous contractions whereas low amplitude contractions may be inefficient i.e. GERD and high amplitude contractions my provoke chest pain or dysfagia i.e. diffuse spasm. The latency period between deglutition and contraction is due to a muscle inhibition immediately after the swallow. This inhibition is due to release of NO by an inhibitory neurone located in the myenteric plexus. At the end of the inhibition, the contraction occurs due to release of acetyl choline by an excitatory cholinergic neurone. The exact interplay between these two neurones will determine the <<timing>> or propagation velocity and the amplitude of esophageal contractions. Patients with achalasia have a predominant loss of inhibitory neurones (VIP and NOS) with a relative preservation of excitatory cholinergic neurones. The histophatologic and immunohistochemical status in patients with esophageal primary motor disorders other than achalasia is poorly characterised Examples of deglutitive inhibition in the esophagus can be observed during the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter or when a subject swallows very frequently. In order to quantify deglutitive inhibition we developed a method that induces an artificial high pressure zone in the mid esophageal body. During the latency period after a swallow, the high pressure zone relaxes (is inhibited). With this method, we could measure the magnitude and duration of the inhibitory phenomenon. There is a very good correlation between the degree of deglutitive inhibition and propagation velocity of esophageal contractions. The less inhibition, the faster the propagation velocity of contractions. Simultaneous contractions are the consequence of absent inhibition. Patients with esophageal primary motor disorders may have very fast propagating contractions and a small percentage of simultaneous contractions or up to 100% of simultaneous contractions. The correlation between the degree of inhibition and propagation velocity of contractions suggests that the different primary motor disorders are the expression of a progressive failure in esophageal inhibition.",

Results of observer-rated scales of mood showed a significant reduction of scores, whereas self-assessment of mood showed no change over the study period. Negative mood states, although not severe, were more marked when the specific behavioural symptoms of binge-eating, vomiting, or purging occurred, and they increased as abnormal eating behaviours accumulated. It is suggested that the accompanying dysphoric mood states of bulimia nervosa are likely to be a secondary manifestation related to the presence of abnormal eating symptoms, and that they do no constitute a primary depressive illness.",

There are two primary features of addiction to all forms of natural and pharmacological stimuli. First, the rewarding stimulus associated with the addiction is a compelling motivator of behavior at the expense of behaviors leading to the acquisition of other rewarding stimuli. Thus, individuals come to orient increasing amounts of their daily activity around acquisition of the rewarding stimulus to which they are addicted. Second, there is a persistence of craving for the addictive stimulus, combined with an inability to regulate the behaviors associated with obtaining that stimulus. Thus, years after the last exposure to an addictive stimulus, reexposure to that stimulus or environmental cues associated with that stimulus will elicit behavior seeking to obtain the reward.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) have increased lately, and they are increasingly seen in routine clinical set- tings. Eating disorders are associated with abnormalities in eating behaviors such as fear of obesity, apocleisis, binge-eating, and self-vomiting. These abnormalities result in complications such as malnutrition. The physical effects of these disor- ders include extended periods of chronic hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, swelling of the salivary gland, caries, anemia, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypo- chloremia, and prolonged metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, renal failure or heart failure tends to occur due to these abnormalities. In addition, the possibility of sudden death due to arrhythmia is not uncommon. Gastric rupture may also occur due to binging or fierce vomiting. Secondary amenorrhea occurs in more than 90% of AN patients because of chronic malnutrition. Reduction of bone mass leads to an increased risk of bone fractures later in life. In addition, psychological compli- cations such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disor- ders, and personality disorders are common, and it is important to note that domes- tic conflicts are manifested when patients develop eating disorders. Therefore, a multifaceted therapeutic approach, focused on the mental and physical aspects, is necessary in the treatment of eating disorders.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

It interacts negatively with sleep and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness. In particular, waking up three or more times a night to void is related to a steep increase in sleep disturbances. Giddiness, both at night and during the day, is another common consequence, since in three out of four cases, nocturia can be attributed to nocturnal urine overproduction, causing a negative fluid balance. Fall injuries are the most important risk associated with nocturia. Nocturia may be attributable not only to nocturnal polyuria, but also to a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Treatment may include diuretics (taken in the afternoon instead of in the morning), vasopressin analogs (desmopressin) at bedtime or antimuscarinic drugs to improve nocturnal bladder capacity.",

      "title": "Design of an Assistive Device for Older Age People Suffering from Essential Tremor",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or tremors, in different parts and on different sides of the body. Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Essential tremor is characterised by rhythmic shaking that occurs during voluntary movement or while holding a position against gravity. The two types of tremor include: Action tremor – a voluntary movement such as lifting a cup to one's mouth and Postural tremor – a voluntary holding of a position against gravity such as reaching or extending one's hand or arm. Most people with essential tremor experience both postural and action tremor. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. So, the aim of this project is to design an assistive device for older age people suffering from essential disorder which can be able to nullify the tremor produced in the hand with maximum percentage of efficiency and ergonomically designed for easy use. The main objective of the project is focusing on the design of an intelligent device that can recognize the tremor automatically by differentiating the frequency at normal stage and at the shaking stage in order to accomplish the neutralizing effect in the shortest possible time",

Revisão bibliográfica: A BN é caracterizada por episódios de comer compulsivo associado a uma sensação de falta de controle comendo demais durante o episódio. Esses episódios são tipicamente seguidos de culpa e vergonha, que desencadeiam comportamentos compensatórios para evitar o ganho de peso. A AN é distinta como uma condição de auto-inanição, em que as pessoas estão abaixo do peso e se envolvem em comportamentos para evitar o ganho de peso. Estes distúrbios se relacionam a uma série de parâmetros socioculturais, fatores familiares, afeto negativo, baixa autoestima e insatisfação corporal. Considerações finais: A anorexia nervosa e a bulimia são os principais transtornos alimentares, nas quais os indivíduos mais afetados do sexo feminino. Os dois distúrbios tem um alto prejuízo, afetando o funcionamento social, psicológico e ocupacional de uma pessoa de tal forma que seu impacto pode persistir muito além do próprio transtorno.

      "title": "Recognizing and Defining Occasional Constipation: Expert Consensus Recommendations",
      "abstract": "Constipation is a common problem, affects 15% of the population, and is often self-diagnosed and self-managed. Over the past 3 decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding and management of chronic constipation, with the emerging recognition that occasional constipation (OC) is another subtype that falls outside current classifications. The purpose of this review was to describe the process of developing and proposing a new definition for OC based on expert consensus and taking into consideration the multifactorial nature of the problem such as alterations in bowel habit that include stool frequency and difficulty with stool passage, perception of the sufferer, duration of symptoms, and potential responsiveness to treatment. Leading gastroenterologists from 5 countries met virtually on multiple occasions through an online digital platform to discuss the problem of OC and recommended a practical, user-friendly definition: “OC can be defined as intermittent or occasional symptomatic alteration(s) in bowel habit. This includes a bothersome reduction in the frequency of bowel movements and/or difficulty with passage of stools but without alarming features. Bowel symptoms may last for a few days or a few weeks, and episodes may require modification of lifestyle, dietary habits and/or use of over-the-counter laxatives or bulking agents to restore a satisfactory bowel habit.” Prospective studies are required to validate this definition and determine OC prevalence in the community. This review highlights current knowledge gaps and could provide impetus for future research to facilitate an improved understanding of OC and development of evidence-based management guidelines.",

      "title": "Not the Function of Eating, but Spontaneous Activity and Energy Expenditure, Reflected in “Restlessness” and a “Drive for Activity” Appear to Be Dysregulated in Anorexia Nervosa: Treatment Implications",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is uncommon as a syndrome, despite widespread dieting or voluntary food restriction, especially among female adolescents. This suggests that restriction of caloric intake might not be the only component driving weight loss in AN. Historical observations and experimental evidence from energy expenditure studies and recordings from movement sensors reviewed in this paper reveal that AN is associated with motor activity levels and with an energy output not significantly different from that in normal-weight healthy age-matched controls. By contrast, other conditions of prolonged caloric under-nutrition are typically associated with loss of energy, slowing of movements and a decrease in self-initiated activity and well being. Several hypotheses can be inferred from the findings : a) that long term severe caloric restriction fails in downregulating movements and energy expenditure in AN. b) Clinically and subjectively observable as mental and physical restlessness and continued motor activity, this restless energy, differering in intensity, seems to serve as the permissive factor for and possibly to drive exercise and hyperactivity in AN. c) Such restless energy and increased arousal, generated sometime in the course of the weight loss process, appear to enhance the person's self -perception and wellbeing, to heighten proprioception, to intensify body awareness and to improve self-esteem. d) Restlessness and continued motor activity may constitute a phenotype of AN. The therapeutic value of the concept of an abnormality in the energy regulatory system, likely the result of a host of genetic and epigenetic changes in AN, lies primarily in its heuristic and explanatory power and its potential for disease prevention. Restless energy as a permissive and important component for the development and in the maintenance of AN, does not fundamentally alter treatment, since prolonged food deprivation is the principal causal factor for the development of AN. Renutrition within a structured treatment plan, to include individual and family therapy remains the most effective symptomatic treatment for AN. Corroboration of the concept of restless activation will require the patient's cooperation and input to identify and capture more precisely the experiences, sensations and changes that allow the emaciated patient to remain mobile and active.",

Symptoms may last for a few hours or persist for several days, spontaneous recovery is common. Familial cases can be distinguished from secondary, non-familial forms which are based on other diseases, for example, of the thyroid gland, kidneys or gastrointestinal tract. Familial cases are mostly inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern and belong to the channelopathies. Both groups are characterised by changed potassium levels in the blood during an episode. A detailed and accurate medical history (plus family history, use of medication and eating habits) often easily leads to the diagnosis. Provoking tests or instrumental and histological investigations can help to solve difficult cases. Treatment focuses on relieving acute symptoms and attacks can be managed by correcting the blood potassium to a normal level. Changing eating and/or exercise habits and also permanent medical treatment helps to prevent further attacks.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). The OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarily delta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

      "abstract": "### Treatment of tobacco addiction\n\nMost smokers show symptoms of addiction to nicotine.1 The symptoms and signs of addiction are described by diagnostic classification systems, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

The medical community has failed to focus enough attention on this condition, which remains a sort of psychosocial taboo, enhancing patient anxiety. Defecatory distur- bance classified according to cause and location can fall into one of four groups: 1) Endocrine abnormalities; 2) Disturbances of colonic origin that result from the long-term use of antihypertensive drugs or antidepressants or from circadian rhythm disturbances that occur with skipping breakfast or lower dietary fiber. Irri- table bowel syndrome (IBS) and melanosis coli cases fall under this category; 3) Defecatory disturbance originating in the rectum (outlet obstruction syndrome). Rectocele, rectal prolapse, concealed prolapse, mucosal prolapse syndrome, and irritable rectal syndrome fall into this category. Pelvic descent and perineal descent are often caused by a dysfunction of the pudendal nerves that innervate the atonic levator ani muscle that forms the basis of the pelvis; and 4) Defecatory disturbance caused by anal diseases such as hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, fissure, postoperative complications, as well as other factors. The same individual may have more than one of the complications listed above. Therefore, diagnosis by thorough examina- tion is essential.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to effectively adapt to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands by selectively altering one’s thoughts, responses and/or behaviors. It can be assessed using several different neurocognitive tasks, including those that measure set-shifting and task-switching. This chapter will summarize the state of the science of cognitive flexibility deficits in individuals with eating disorders. Cognitive flexibility deficits in neuropsychological tasks appear to be most pronounced among individuals with anorexia nervosa and may be less characteristic of other eating disorders. Implications for a discrepancy in findings between objective and subjective measures of cognitive flexibility are also provided, as well implications for therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "When stress overwhelms the body or persists for a long time (chronic stress), the body is affected by it in a number of ways. Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "title": "Part III: Insomnia and Circadian Dysrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "Persons with severe dementia and the notion of bodily autonomy*",
      "abstract": "Generally, dementia is a long-lasting and gradual process. While the body often remains strong for a number of years, mental capacities as well as the accumulated competencies and memories of a lifetime gradually slip away. Late stage symptoms include an inability to recognize familiar objects, surroundings, or people, increasing physical frailty, difficulties in eating and swallowing, weight loss, incontinence, and gradual loss of speech and movement control. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. In the end stage, people with dementia lie in bed in a foetus-like position seemingly living as a vegetative organism, being totally dependent on the care of others. This chapter focuses on people with severe dementia, answering the question of what supportive care could contribute to the well-being of these people. It argues that people with severe dementia cannot entirely be denied a (rudimentary) form of selfhood or personhood. They definitively are not persons in the strict sense of moral agents who are self-conscious and rational and demonstrate a minimal moral sense, but at least they can be called persons in a weaker sense.",

      "title": "Silent latency periods in methylmercury poisoning and in neurodegenerative disease.",
      "abstract": "This article discusses three examples of delay (latency) in the appearance of signs and symptoms of poisoning after exposure to methylmercury. First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.",

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

In most instances of these secondary eating disorders there appears to be a true alteration in appetite, that is in the desire and relish for food. Primary eating disorders on the other hand are complex behavioral disturbances which do not result directly from changes in appetite. In this category are obesity, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia. The conditions of obesity and anorexia nervosa have been accepted for many years as clinical problems, and their history can be traced far back in the annals of medicine. The situation in regard to bulimia is rather different, since it has been recognized only recently as a subject of medical concern. The purpose of the present paper is to review the emergence of bulimia in the medical literature, discuss its status as a disorder, and advise caution before it is uncritically accepted as an illness entity.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Does medically induced weight loss improve obstructive sleep apnoea in the obese: review of randomized trials",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repeated periods of breathing cessation during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnoea is both common and underdiagnosed in the obese. A recent study found that as many as 86% of older obese type 2 diabetics had obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity is independently associated with developing obstructive sleep apnoea, and the reverse may also occur. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is therefore expected to rise in the wake of the obesity epidemic. The number of partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) airway obstructions per hour (apnoea-hypopnoea index) is used to classify obstructive sleep apnoea as mild (5-14 events per hour), moderate (15-30) or severe (>30). Severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with a two to sixfold increase in all-cause mortality; the impact of mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnoea is less clear. Until recently, the evidence supporting a beneficial effect of weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea has been limited by a lack of randomized trials. In 2009, at least three randomized controlled trials evaluated whether medically induced weight loss improves obstructive sleep apnoea. The treatment effect ranged from 42% to 62% improvement, although the highest estimate was seen in a very short duration study (9 weeks). Patients who either lost 10-15 kg or more, or had severe obstructive sleep apnoea at baseline, benefited most from treatment.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect. Keywords: chronic dizziness; chronic instability; ototoxicity; vestibulotoxicity; dynamic posturography.

The cardinal symptom of ALS, weakness, may compromise nutrition in a number of ways and multiple factors may be present in the same individual. Usually, long before the actual diagnosis of ALS, a patient may be noticing some unintentional weight loss, a decrease in appetite, slight tripping, periods of restlessness, and/or slurred speech. More often than not, these individual complaints can be easily dismissed by a patient who attributes these problems to recent colds, changes in eating habits and/or exercise, changes in the weather, or allergies, just to name a few. However when these problems do not go away, but actually continue to worsen, some patients realize their probable diagnosis. They may remain in denial of this now overt symptom progression.",

      "abstract": "Lower dyspeptic syndrome is a bowel disease manifesting namely with pain or sensation of abdominal discomfort and bowel movement problems (changes in the frequency and stool consistency). Symptoms include sensation of intraabdominal pressure and fullness, diarrhoea (with or without pain), sensation of incomplete defecation, constipation or bowel movement problems (with or without pain), irregular stool, collywobbles and bowel content flow (borborygia with spasms), meteorism, flatulency. Prevalence of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the European population is estimated to be 5 to 25 %. In the Czech Republic the total prevalence of dyspepsias is about 13 %. To the pathogenesis of the lower dyspeptic syndrome contribute: 1. abnormal motility, 2. abnormal visceral perception, 3. psychosocial factors, 4. luminal factors, 5. imbalance of neurotransmitters and/or intestinal bacteria and 6. possible inflammatory changes of the intestinal mucosa. Infectious diarrhoea is one of the causes. Functional bowel defects represent various combinations of chronic and recurrent symptoms from the digestive tract which cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional defect manifesting with abdominal pain, intestinal dyspepsia and compulsive defecations. Subtypes with typical symptomatology are characterized by circumstances which bring about pain and compulsive defecations (morning fractional defecation, postprandial defecation, debacles). Functional diarrhoea manifests with diarrhoea without intensive pain. Spastic obstipation manifests by abdominal pain, obstipation, compulsive defecations are absent, stool is cloddish, fragmented by spastic haustration, or it has a ribbon-form. Changes in the intestinal chemism include fermentative and putrefactive dyspepsia. Among the incomplete and atypical forms the isolated meteorism, irregular defecation, flatulency, abdominal pain--syndrome of the left or right epigastium or the syndrome of the right hypogastrium can be included. In patients with typical set of symptoms the working diagnose of the lower dyspeptic syndrome can be done by general practitioner. Complete history of the disease can reveal possible extra abdominal cause of dyspepsia, recognise alarming symptoms and consider circumstances elevating or lowering the probability of functional problems. Functional bowel problems have usually long-term character and represent clinically demanding challenge. Only few therapeutic regimens are successful and the therapy aimed at the abolishment of one symptom need not bring general improvement. For the clinical studies of the therapy of functional bowel problems significant placebo effect is typical. Quoad vitam prognosis is good, quoad sanationem it is rather doubtful.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, need to rush to the toilet, straining, feeling of incomplete bowel emptying and alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation is the clinical definition of the irritable bowel syndrome. The internationally used syndrome definition is based on expert opinions and answers to patient questionnaires. When symptoms are registered prospectively, abdominal pain starts or worsens after meals and is not relieved by defecation. As in the general population patients with the syndrome define diarrhea as loose stools and constipation as hard stools regardless of stool frequencies. Variation in defecatory symptoms and discrepancies between these symptoms and stool consistency are the hallmarks of the syndrome, and the degree of variation per fortnight is relatively stable in the individual patient. Fermentation of carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, increased sensitivity to bowel distention by gas, gas-producing food, increased secretion of cholecystokinin after fatty meals and/or increased sympathetic nerve tone at stress can give rise to symptoms. Symptoms can start after a single period of bacterial gastroenteritis. Although patients seeking medical care for the syndrome are more often anxious, the syndrome itself is not psychosomatic. Symptoms are possibly mediated through partial degranulation of mast cells in bowel mucosa, but this does not make it an allergic disease. If bowel dysmotility can be measured, early stage or a mild case of intestinal pseudoobstruction should be considered. Hyperreactivity in the enteric nervous system and/or in the brain is the likely main cause of the symptoms. More widespread activity in the brain after exposure to stimuli originating from bowel nerves or less inhibition of this stimulation in the brain are possible mechanisms.",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Emotional Elevations of Blood Pressure in Trained Dogs",
      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "title": "Overview: Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Summary An disorder is marked by extremes. It is present when a person experiences severe disturbances in behavior, such as extreme reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, or feelings of extreme distress or concern about body weight or shape. A person with an disorder may have started out just smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but at some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control. Eating disorders are very complex, and despite scientific research to understand them, the biological, behavioral and social underpinnings of these illnesses remain elusive. The two main types of disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third category is eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), which includes several variations of disorders. Eating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they can develop during childhood or later in adulthood. Women and girls are much more likely than males to develop an disorder. Men and boys account for an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients with anorexia or bulimia and an estimated 35 percent of those with binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses with complex underlying psychological and biological causes. They frequently co-exit with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. People with disorders also can suffer from numerous other physical health complications, such as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento.

      "title": "Clinical Management of Constipation",
      "abstract": "First, it is important to find out whether the patient is complaining of infrequent defaecation, excessive straining at defaecation, abdominal pain or bloating, a general sense of malaise attributed to constipation, soiling, or a combination of more than one symptom. Second, one must decide if there is a definable abnormality as a cause of the symptom(s). Is the colon apparently normal or is its lumen widened (megacolon)? Is the upper gut normal or is there evidence of neuropathy or myopathy? Is the anorectum normal or is there evidence of a weak pelvic floor, mucosal prolapse, major rectocele, an internal intussusception or solitary rectal ulcer? Is there any systemic component such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, neurological or psychiatric disorder or relevant drug therapy? Choice of treatment will depend on this clinical evaluation. The range of treatments available is: Reassurance and stop current treatment: Patients with a bowel obsession may take laxatives or rectal preparations regularly without need. Increase dietary fibre: Most cases of 'simple' constipation respond to increased dietary fibre, possibly with an added supplement of natural bran. Toilet training and altered routine of life: Young people particularly may need to recognise the call to stool and alter their daily routine to permit and encourage regular defaecation. Medicinal bulking agent: Ispaghula, methyl cellulose, concentrated wheat germ or bran, and similar preparations are useful when patients with a normal colon find it difficult to take adequate dietary fibre. These preparations increase the bulk of stool and soften its consistency. They may be useful for those patients with the constipated form of irritable bowel syndrome. Additional bulk does not help patients with megacolon or severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Osmotic laxatives or saline perfusion: Preparations of magnesium hydroxide or sulphate, sodium sulphate, or mannitol soften the stool and if taken in sufficient quantity produce a liquid stool. Magnesium hydroxide is a useful mild laxative for use in childhood. Patients with idiopathic megacolon need to keep the stools liquid with an osmotic laxative. Stimulant laxatives: Anthranoid preparations, bisacodyl and its derivatives are used occasionally by many patients and regularly by some patients with severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Prokinetic drugs: Can be helpful as a supplement to laxatives. Rectal preparations: Useful particularly for emptying the rectum in childhood and elderly patients with rectal impaction and soiling. Biofeedback: Biofeedback training to increase rectal sensitivity to distension, relax the pelvic floor and increase the effectiveness of straining is proving beneficial for some patients with slow transit constipation and many of those with marked paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor including children with soiling. Psychological: Certain patients, for example those with 'denied bowel actions' or eating disorders need primary psychiatric treatment. Other patients, for example those with a history of sexual abuse, may need it as a supportive measure. Surgery: Surgery is needed for aganglionosis, a few patients with idiopathic megacolon or idiopathic slow transit constipation or pseudoobstruction, and for those with severe rectal mucosal prolapse.",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

      "abstract": "Shift work sleep disorder is a common problem in industrialized countries because of the need for occupations and services to continue to function 24 hours/day. Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

This chapter focuses on AN and BN as they tend to be the most well-known forms of eating disorders and often generate the most concern in parents. It explores the following: what are AN and BN; how common are they; what do people with AN and BN do; what are the consequences of AN and BN; and what are their causes. Possible risk factors of AN and BN are body dissatisfaction and dieting. AN and BN are also associated with other factors such as genetics, issues of control and family dynamics.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "[Management of infantile colics].",
      "abstract": "Infantile colic concerns about 10-30% of all newborns and has been defined as a condition characterized by paroxysmal episodes of unexplained full force crying for at least three days a week and continuing for one week or more in a thriving well-nourished infant. The disorder more likely occurs in the evening, without identifiable causes and resolves spontaneously by the fourth month of life. The several factors involved in the etiopathogenesis (food intolerance or allergy to cow's milk protein, intolerance to lactose, intestinal hyperperistalsis, neuro-hormonal immaturity, maternal anxiety and familial stress), make the management of infants with colics difficult. We propose a scoring system for the evaluation of colics in infants based on: 1) crying intensity and duration; 2) accompanying characteristics of crises (e.g. meteorism, family history for allergic disease, type of feeding, type of stools); 3) evaluation of parents' opinion of their infants' crying. Type of management is based on the score: a) crying that is unrelated to colics: treatments referred to specific diagnosis. b) crying that is related to colics but not severe: first and second step of management; c) crying that is related to colics and is severe: third step of management.first step: pacifier, rocking, dull continuous background noise, hot water bottle on the abdomen, herbal tea, simethicone. Second step: pharmacological treatment and periodic controls. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide). Third step: dietary modification and/or pharmacological treatment: mothers of breast-fed infants are given a diet with no milk or products containing its proteins, or fish, or eggs. Infants who are not breast-fed receive soy milk and if symptoms continue soy milk is substituted with hydrolyzed casein milk formula. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide and in non responders dicyclomine hydrochloride). Dietary modifications appear more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms, since side effects of drugs have been described and our recent results indicate appropriate dietary modifications offer better results than pharmacological treatment in resolving crises. However, before interrupting dietary modifications and reintroducing cow's milk proteins, infant's tolerance to such proteins is tested. In any case because of the good prognosis and rapid regression of symptoms, dietary regimens or pharmacological treatment should only be applied if really necessary and for brief periods under medical supervision.",

Although the etiology of this disorder is unknown, genetic and neurochemical factors have been implicated. Bulimia nervosa is 10 times more common in females than in males and affects up to 3 percent of young women. The condition usually becomes symptomatic between the ages of 13 and 20 years, and it has a chronic, sometimes episodic course. The long-term outcome has not been clarified. Other psychiatric conditions, including substance abuse, are frequently associated with bulimia nervosa and may compromise its diagnosis and treatment. Serious medical complications of bulimia nervosa are uncommon, but patients may suffer from dental erosion, swollen salivary glands, oral and hand trauma, gastrointestinal irritation and electrolyte imbalances (especially of potassium, calcium, sodium and hydrogen chloride). Treatment strategies are based on medication, psychotherapy or a combination of these modalities.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder and endogenous neurophysiological dynamics",
      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

      "title": "Emotional and Autobiographical Memory Deficits in Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe two types of eating disorders Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa are considered today's civilization's diseases. The growing interest showed towards eating disorders has a number of reasons. The prevalence of eating disorders among adolescent girls and young women is relatively high, and it shows a growing tendency (Tury & Szabo, 2000). Anorexia has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders (Steinhausen, 2002). If the eating disorders are not recognized and treated, they can become chronic and have multiple somatic complications, usually characterized by high psychiatric comorbidity.In the psychopathology of eating disorders one can observe the occurrence of an altered self-schema. The self-schema refers to a long lasting and stable set of memories that summarize a person's beliefs, experiences and generalizations about the self in specific behavioral domains. A person may have a self-schema based on any aspect of himself/herself as a person, including physical characteristics, personality traits and interests, as long as they consider that aspect of their self important to their own self-definition (Markus, 1977). The self's relationship with and understanding of the body is an important part of selfschema. Body schema generally refers to a person's concept of his/her own body, where it is in space, what it looks like, how it is functioning. Altered body selfschema determines the adaptation of the information coming from the outer and the inner environments, and distorts adaptation of the information regarding weight (Stewart, 2005; Tekcan, Caglar Tas, Topcouglu & Yucel, 2008; Rawal, Park & Williams, 2010). This distortion covers the very basic features of weight, shape and diet as well. In the studies made in the field of eating disorders, the specific thoughts connected to the disorder are particularly emphasized. These thoughts can be worries about eating control, and about weight and shape (Rawal et al., 2010), or about meals.The deficits of emotional functioning have been widely examined in anorexia nervosa (further AN) (Nandrino, Doba, Lesne, Christophe & Pezard, 2006; Jones, Harmer & Cooper, 2008). There is diversity in the ways how different researchers define emotion regulation. The most acceptable definition is: Emotion regulation consists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions, especially their intensive and temporal features, to accomplish one's goals (Thompson, 1994, p. 27-28). Gross (1998) has proposed a model of emotion regulation which indicates that both cognitive and behavior strategies may be used to regulate emotions, either before or after emotion occurs. A fully functioning and coherent affect regulation performs two functions. One is to attenuate the negative affects and to help the self to process and assimilate the negative experiences and to integrate them. The other is to create positive affect, based on the past life experiences processed, reinforcing the self in problem solving processes. Affect-regulation is the ability of a person to reduce the negative emotions and to create positive ones.The difficulty of emotion recognition causes problems in the emotive state of the individual and of others as well (Zonnevijlle-Bender, van Goozen, Cohen-Kettenis, van Elburg & van Engeland, 2002; Sharpe, Wallis, & Ridout, 2016). The damage or the lack of the cognitive components of emotional response system, such as subjective consciousness, and the ability of emotional narration (defined as alexithymia), is in the background of the regulation deficit. Distrust to interpersonal relationships and lack of awareness are added, too (Nandrino et al., 2006).The literature published on eating disorders shows that anorexic patients have a dysfunctional affect regulation. They are characterized by cognitive biases and extreme focusing on negative affects (Karwautz et al. …",

Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder. This may happen because of habits formed because of insomnia (such as napping, getting in bed before being sleepy, and lying-in bed awake for long periods of time).

Some anorexic patients refuse to eat totally, while others may practice \"binge eating.\" Patients who binge eat and employ postprandial purging are referred to as \"bulimic.\" Anorexia nervosa and bulimia can produce multisystem abnormalities. Dysfunction of organ systems in anorexia is the result of self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and severe malnutrition. Diseases of the skeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems may have an impact on the plan of anesthesia care. A thorough anesthetic interview and evaluation to assess the debilitation of each patient is essential so that appropriate preparation can be made for comprehensive anesthetic care. This paper focuses on the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa, discusses a thorough preanesthetic assessment, and guides the appropriate anesthetic management of the anorexic patient. Anorexia bulimia is briefly mentioned, since it is an eating disorder with physiological derangements similar to anorexia nervosa.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

      "abstract": "Summary Anorexia nervosa, which is one of the forms of eating disorders, can be considered as a manifestation of a long and very complex process of self-destruction. Although its genesis is usually associated with puberty problems, it is rarely a rapid phenomenon. It should be treated rather as a kind of epilogue of one’s personal history. Malnutrition and weight control appearing in its context are in fact a manifestation of an attempt to cope with the hardships experienced by individual. Therefore, the anorexia nervosa is not just a problem of weight or eating habits, but it’s a way of manifesting the internal problem of the individual. Its form, defined by the otherwise valid canons of beauty or success, and consolidated by behaviours learned during the use of slimming diets, is revealed, however, in connection with specific personality traits. That is why the importance of people with this disorder, to a large extent, of tendencies to self-destructive behaviour, leading more or less consciously to self-destruction and in extreme cases to death, is emphasized. The article deals with the problem of anorexia nervosa as a manifestation of self-destructive tendencies and the issue of factors and mechanisms conditioning the occurrence of self-destructive behaviour from the perspective of selected psychodynamic concepts, indicating the importance of the issue for the care and educational processes.",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, straining, urgency, incomplete evacuation, nausea, and bloating) that occur alongside bowel function alterations (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, or both). Patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also experience comorbid anxiety and depression. Irritable bowel syndrome is common, with a prevalence estimated between 3% and 28%, affecting patient health and quality of life. Patients with moderate or severe irritable bowel syndrome generally seek medical care, whereas those with milder symptoms may choose self-management. Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome receive outpatient care, but irritable bowel syndrome-related hospitalizations do occur. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial (i.e. genetics, immune components, changes in the gut microbiota, disturbances in physiologic stress response systems, and psychosocial factors). Management of irritable bowel syndrome can include lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, counseling, psychologic medication, and agents that affect gastrointestinal motility. A number of therapies have emerged in recent years with clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy and safety for patients with irritable bowel syndrome, including agents that target gastrointestinal motility (i.e. linaclotide), gastrointestinal opioid receptors (i.e. asimadoline, eluxadoline), and gut microbiota (i.e. rifaximin). Linaclotide has been shown to significantly improve stool frequency and abdominal pain compared with placebo in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (number needed to treat, 5.1). Asimadoline shows efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome-related pain. Rifaximin provided adequate relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms versus placebo for a significantly greater percentage of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( p &lt; 0.001). Management that encompasses all aspects of irritable bowel syndrome (gastrointestinal symptoms) and comorbid psychologic symptoms (e.g. anxiety or depression) is important for improving overall patient health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "A much discussed and worrisome topic today is growing ratio of eating disorders among people especially youth. Eating disorders are characteristic behavioral disorders which present persistent disturbances in eating behavior with body weight, body image and body shape continuously preoccupying an individual’s mind. These behavioral disorders affect a person’s social life along with affecting physical and psychological health. Excessive food intake, compulsive strenuous exercise, food restriction, starvation, use of laxatives, vomiting immediately after eating, binging and purging are some behaviors which depict the presence of an eating disorder. Collectively, up to 5% population, mostly adolescents and young adults suffer from eating disorders. Usually both male and female of any age and ethnicity are at equal risk of having an eating disorder but generally women suffer more as compared to men. Of eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa are common among females but can also occur in males. Psychiatric problems also occur hand in hand with eating disorders such as disproportionate mood swings, OCD, anxiety and panic attacks and different drugs abuse. Treatment of eating disorders involves treating psychological as well as physical complications along with addressing malnutrition, GERD and other gastrointestinal problems.&#x0D; Out of other eating disorders bulimia nervosa has shown increasing trends among youth. Binge eating or Bulimia nervosa is eating larger quantity of foods in shorter time span. A binge eater firstly binges on food, feels ashamed of his/her action and weight, purges secretly and also feels guilty for eating too much. While binging is done with consuming large quantity of food or filling up to the throat within short time, associated discomfort, nausea and vomiting source the purging phase. Occurrence of bulimia nervosa among young females and adolescents is high but statistics also indicate increasing ratios in young adolescent males. Although bulimia is common among youth, it can affect individuals of all ages and gender having low, normal or high weight.&#x0D; Adolescents and young adults suffering from bulimia nervosa are often those who are mentally preoccupied with weight issues, fear to gain weight, have a dreadful urge to lose weight, are super conscious and discontented with their body image, size and shape.&#x0D; An emblematic case of an individual with bulimia nervosa is often an adolescent to young adult female or male having an enthusiastic, goal oriented, perfectionist, and diligent, introverted and stubborn personality. Such individuals are also awful self-critics and tend to have low self-esteem based on body image distortion. Regardless of the physical parameters, binging on large quantities of food and then purging them out gives the person a sense of satisfaction by eating the desired type of food in hefty amounts along with a sense of control and relief by throwing up or excreting it out as an attempt to maintain weight. Generally the affected individuals do this to eat whatever they want while maintaining or losing weight upon wish. This mechanism also relieves stress, anxiety and reduces negative moods for them, keeping them calm and composed by giving the person a sense of control in at least one aspect of his/her life, which largely explains reason for the increased ratios of bulimia among youth who are constantly subjected to body shaming, peer pressure, fear of being left out, sky rocketing pressure from social media to be and look perfect and to be up to the mark with the societal beauty standards.",

      "title": "Changes of Sympathovagal Balance Measured by Heart Rate Variability in Gastroparetic Patients Treated with Gastric Electrical Stimulation",
      "abstract": "Gastroparesis, a gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying without evidence of mechanical obstruction (Nilsson, 1996), clinically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, with a compromised nutritional state. Gastroparesis has multiple etiologies but the dominant ones are diabetes (DM), idiopathic (ID) and post-surgical (P-S). Frequent hospital admissions, and severe symptoms make gastroparesis patients socially restricted (Soykan et al., 1998). Approximately one third of gastroparesis cases are caused by diabetes mellitus. Diabetic gastroparesis may be attributed to impaired motor activity involving gastric hypomotility and unpropagated contractions (lack of peristalsis) and/or impaired myoelectrical activity explained by abnormal frequency of the gastric slow wave (dysrhythmia), low amplitude and/or uncoupling of slow waves (You et al., 1980; Telander et al.,1978; Geldof et al.,1986; Chen et al., 1992). The most common treatment for gastroparesis is the use of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone. However, only two agents are currently available in the USA, metoclopramide and erythromycin. Side effects from these agents result in up to 40% of patients being unable to tolerate chronic use (Sturm et al., 1999). Those who are refractory or intolerant to prokinetic agents often undergo abdominal surgery for the placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube which is only for nutritional support and does not improve gastric motility (Reardon et al., 1989; Ejskjaer et al., 1999). Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is an emerging therapy for refractory gastroparesis. Currently two types of GES have been investigated for treatment of gastroparesis: (i) longpulse or high energy with low frequency stimulation and (ii) short-pulse or low energy with high frequency stimulation. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) with short pulses and low energy (Enterra Device) was FDA approved in 2000 as a therapeutic option in the management of refractory gastroparesis (Familoni et al., 1997; Forster et al., 2001; Abell et al., 2002, 2003). Long-pulse and high energy stimulation, another approach to GES, achieves gastric pacing and represents a promising new treatment for gastric motility disorders (Hocking et al., 1992; McCallum et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1998). In this method, the electrical stimulus is composed of repetitive single pulses with a pulse width in the order of",

The mentalizing model assumes the existence of developmental vulnerabilities, especially during adolescence, and that the range of different symptoms associated with eating disorders may have the common function of being attempts at social self-regulation. Controlling eating is a way of managing social and emotional developmental milestones that the person perceives as insuperable. Patients with eating disorders become stuck in a low mentalizing experience of themselves and their bodies. Clinical treatment based on this formulation is discussed as it is applied in a combined program of individual and group psychotherapy, together with psychoeducation.",

The present paper cites studies suggesting that this factor is predominantly associated with the bulimic pattern of eating disturbance, while “restriction” may be associated rather with hypercontrol of behaviour. Further evidence is cited suggesting that the relationship between hyper- and hypocontrol is actually very intimate, both on a behavioural and biochemical level. Rather than bulimics being generally impulsive and “restrictors” generally hypercontrolled, future studies may reveal impulse regulation difficulties of both kinds in both groups. Single-minded preoccupation with dieting may be an ill-equipped individual's effort to simplify life in periods of change and environmental challenge that demand capacity for flexible impulse regulation.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "1221 Multiple Sleep Latency Testing in Patients with Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) has an estimated prevalence of 10-25%. Disorders of central hypersomnolence such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia pose a diagnostic challenge since commonly used psychotropic medications can alter REM sleep parameters on polysomnography (PSG). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has published protocols for the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), including a 2-week medication discontinuation period (MDP) prior to testing, however discontinuation must be carefully considered. Report of case(s) A 22-year-old female with obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and optic nerve hypoplasia presented with episodic EDS for several years. Epworth was 14 despite amphetamine-dextromphetamine 30mg twice daily. These episodes would last for 1-2 weeks without associated hypersexuality, increased food seeking behaviors or changes in cognition. Additionally, she would experience periods of not sleeping for days at a time, but not decreased need for sleep. She denied cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. No symptoms of bipolar disorder reported. Initial polysomnography showed 432 minutes of sleep, REM latency of 39.5 minutes and AHI of 0.1. MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 11.5 minutes without sleep onset REM periods. She reported later that she was unable to complete the MDP for escitalopram. The diagnosis at that time was hypersomnolence related to a mental disorder, and referred back to psychiatry. She returned 20 months later with more persistent hypersomnolence and a MDP was attempted again, this time with confirmation. She stopped venlafaxine and stimulant per protocol. PSG was again unremarkable and MSLT showed mean sleep latency of 7 minutes across 5 naps and SOREMP in 4 naps, resulting in the diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy. Conclusion Sleep symptoms are common in patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, and MDP can pose safety risks or be poorly adhered to. Longitudinal follow-up, repeat testing for persistent and worsening symptoms of EDS, and careful questioning about adherence to MSLT protocol can help clarify the eventual diagnosis. Support (if any) None.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress.

Death occurred between the 28th and 120th hr. Body motility, eye movements, respiratory and cardiac rhythms, chin myogram, electroencephalogram (EEG), and crying were evaluated by careful observation and by polygraphic recordings for periods of from 1 to 2 hr. A very rich and continuous motility is described consisting of rapid jerks, either diffuse or localized, and of slow movements. Rhythmic movements of the chin or peribuccal area occur in bursts and are particularly striking. The paucity of rapid eye movements (REM) is also remarkable. The EEG is composed of silent periods interrupted by discontinuous polymorphic activity. The fixation of the cardiac rate, the absence of periodic respiration and of apneic periods are the most important vegetative phenomena. Crying occurs in short periods rarely lasting more than 20 sec. The state of these previable prematures cannot be considered as waking; it seems to be a very immature state of sleep that differs from both the quiet and the active sleep of full‐term newborns. This atypical sleep, which appears to be present in other species characterized by a great degree of immaturity at birth, does not give any evidence of cyclic organization.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCAO. Os disturbios alimentares, mais conhecidos como Anorexia Nervosa e Bulimia, sao caracterizados por uma disfuncao no processo alimenticio do sujeito sendo consideradas duas patologias que podem ter consequencias graves, inclusive a morte. A Anorexia Nervosa atinge ambos os sexos, sendo uma distorcao da imagem corporal que o individuo tem sobre si mesmo, onde apresenta uma perda de peso exacerbada e rapida que pode alterar alguns processos orgânicos. Os pacientes que apresentam esse transtorno alimentar tendem a manter o peso abaixo do esperado para sua faixa etaria e apresentam um grande medo de engordar, mesmo abaixo do peso. O tratamento deste transtorno vem sendo feito com trabalho multidisciplinar, tendo como objetivo principal a recuperacao da saude fisica e psicologica do paciente, levando-o a uma melhora nos quadros fisicos e cognitivos, tendo como consequencia a recuperacao do peso ideal do paciente. Um vies importante para os casos de transtorno alimentar e a relacao com a familia, podendo aparecer sentimentos de culpa, raiva, hostilidade. OBJETIVO . compreender as relacoes familiares em dois casos de transtornos alimentares, especificamente, anorexia nervosa, a partir de uma perspectiva Junguiana. METODO . Trata-se de um estudo de dois casos retirados do livro “Anorexia Nervosa e Bulimia: Ameacas a Autonomia” (HERSCOVICI & BAY, 1997). A analise foi feita segundo a perspectiva Jungiana. RESULTADO E DISCUSSAO . Na primeira analise temos o caso de uma menina de onze anos, inserida em um contexto de conflito familiar em que presenciou uma briga entre seus pais, onde ele foi uma figura agressiva. Ela apresenta um quadro de Anorexia Nervosa severa, tendo um historico de internacao por nove meses com alimentacao parenteral, com isso o animus que internalizado pela menina pode ter sido negativo, tendo dificuldades com o corpo e em se relacionar com o sexo oposto por causa do conflito com o pai. O segundo caso e de uma jovem de vinte anos, orfa de pai e filha mais nova da familia. No seu historico tem episodios de anorexia. E relatada uma idealizacao da mae em relacao ao corpo perfeito das filhas, as levando a tratamentos rigorosos para manter a forma, podendo ser explicada pela teoria de compensacao, onde as energias sao focalizadas em um unico ponto, tornando o corpo um objeto idealizado. Apos anos, ela apresenta grandes variacoes de peso, se internando em clinicas especializadas para perda de peso e seguindo dieta influenciada pela familia, com isso evoluiu para um quadro de bulimia e entao para evitar o ganho de peso e aconselhada pela irma a induzir o vomito, o que, por causa da frequencia, lhe causou danos orgânicos como dores abdominais e sono. CONSIDERACOES FINAIS. Nota-se, a partir dos casos estudados, vemos a importância e influencia que a familia sobre as pacientes e, com a necessidade de tratamento, a familia deve ser inserida no contexto. Criancas que vivem em meio a conflitos familiares ou sao objetos de idealizacao dos pais acabam por nao ter uma transicao para a adolescencia de forma tranquila, podendo descontar suas angustias em seu corpo, na tentativa de ser perfeita, ou para chamar a atencao. O trabalho exposto nos revelou que, para abordar este transtorno, a opcao por tratamentos multidisciplinares tem sido mais eficientes.

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is characterised by a morbid fear of gaining weight and concerted efforts to reduce weight through restricting food intake and, in some cases, purging/vomiting and excessively exercising. Bulimia nervosa is characterised by episodes of bingeing on food, followed by concerted efforts to rid the body of food, through vomiting or use of purgatives. Binge eating disorder is characterised by episodes of bingeing on large quantities of food, followed by feelings of extreme guilt and self-loathing. Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder is a new classification within eating disorders in both ICD-11 and DSM-5 classification systems. There is no one treatment of choice for eating disorders in children and young people. Typically, a combination of interventions is required to bring about a positive outcome. The involvement of the family in treatment is paramount to its success. Research evidence suggests that treatment in the community rather than in inpatient adolescent units is most effective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The two main phases of sleep are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep occupies a third of human life and cycles within a circadian rhythm. Sleep is essential for daily functioning and is of fundamental importance for maintaining good health. Despite this, people sleep less and less due to different factors including economic activities, work stress, social demand, erroneous beliefs about sleep, excessive use of electronic devices, long hours of work or rotating shifts, and such circumstances generate conditions in which people sleep less than 7 hours a day, well, sleeping less than 7 hours a day is considered as sleep restriction and restricting sleep only a couple of hours per night can lead to deterioration in health and quality of life, producing a significant decrease in cognitive performance. When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems.

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are at the present moment, two well defined clinical entities among the group of the eating disorders. The psychopathological differentiation of both syndromes has a great importance for diagnosis and therapy. The authors make a phenomenological description, based on case histories of patients with diagnostics of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, and try to establish an approach to the essential symptomatology of those disorders. The presence of affective symptomatology--depressive, but not exclusively--in the eating behaviour disorders in general and particularly in bulimia nervosa, is nowadays interpreted as an unspecific emotional lability as a response to stressing situations. That is to say, it is a secondary depressive symptomatology, more than a primary mood disorder preceding or underlying bulimia. There is strong evidence in favour of a dysregulation of serotonin metabolism in patients with bulimia nervosa, in the sense of a reduced activity, which manifest itself clinically by binges with food with a high content in carbohydrates. High levels of 5-HT seem to induce increasing feelings of safety, fullness and lead to an interruption of eating. Fluoxetine and this active metabolite are selective inhibitors of the reuptake of 5-HT and their antibulimic effect could be mediated by this mechanism.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "title": "Nocturnal Enuresis: Current Concepts",
      "abstract": "Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 5 to 7 million children in the United States, making it the most common pediatric urologic complaint encountered by primary care physicians. Despite its prevalence, nocturnal enuresis remains incompletely understood, which can frustrate patients, family members, and physicians. Appropriate intervention is justified for the affected child because of the potential consequences of family stress, social withdrawal, and poor self-esteem.Enuresis refers to the persistence of inappropriate voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated bladder control (age 4 to 5 y at the latest). The development of bladder control is a multidimensional process that requires sensory awareness of bladder fullness by the child, capacity for storage of urine, voluntary control of the bladder sphincter, psychological desire for control, and a positive training experience. Diurnal enuresis is involuntary leaking of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal enuresis refers to involuntary passage of urine during sleep and is classified as primary (no prior period of sustained dryness) or secondary (recurrence of nighttime wetting after 6 mo or longer of dryness). Recent urology literature describes another classification of nocturnal enuresis based on the presence or absence of other bladder symptoms. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is defined as a normal void occurring at night in bed in the absence of any other symptoms referable to the urogenital tract, and it precludes any daytime symptomatology. It is the focus of this article. Polysymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is bed-wetting associated with other bladder symptoms such as urgency, frequency,instability, or voiding dysfunction. Investigations of patients who have MNE reveal that they are clearly different from patients who have PNE.The spontaneous resolution rate of nocturnal enuresis is approximately 15% per year, with 1% of teenagers at 15 years of age still wetting the bed (Fig. 1). Parents may become concerned about nocturnal enuresis when their child reaches 5 to 6 years of age and is preparing to enter school. Most children are not concerned until 7 to 8 years of age. Approximately 80% to 85% of children who have nocturnal enuresis have MNE. Another 5% to 10% of cases meet the definition of PNE, with daytime wetting or other bladder symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for nocturnal enuresis in fewer than 5% of cases. Such organic causes must be searched for and ruled out if the history suggests their presence. There is a slight male predominance (about 60% overall) for nocturnal enuresis. Etiologic factors contributing to MNE include genetics, sleep arousal dysfunction,urodynamics, nocturnal polyuria, psychological components, and maturational delay. That the condition probably is multifactorial, with various contributing factors in any one patient, confounds attempts to base therapeutic approaches on etiology.A hereditary basis for nocturnal enuresis has been suspected for years. Studies of twins show a concordance rate of 43% to 68% for monozygotic and 19% to 36% for dizygotic twins. Seventy percent of children who have enuresis have a parent who has a history of the disorder. Studies indicate that if one parent had enuresis, the probability of a child having it is approximately 40% to 45%. If both parents were affected, the probability of a child having the condition increases to 70% to 77%. If neither parent had enuresis, only 15% of offspring will have enuresis. Chromosomes 12q, 13q, and 22 all have been named as possible locations of a gene(s) resulting in enuresis, but a specific mechanism for enuresis related to a gene locus is not known.The association between the presence of a full bladder and the sensation in the brain of a full bladder occurs in most children by the age of 5 years,which correlates with the normative standard in the United States for nocturnal dryness in 85% of 5-year-olds. Concurrently, by this age the child's pattern of several sleep/wake cycles daily, known as multiphasic sleep, has changed to a single period of sleep daily, known as monophasic sleep. Daytime urination control usually occurs first,followed by learning to arouse during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder. Many parents report that a child who has enuresis is more difficult to arouse from sleep than are other children in the home, but sleep studies have not documented a convincing association between a child's sound sleep and a nocturnal wetting episode.The relationship of sleep patterns with enuresis is an area of active research. In some studies, the enuretic event seemed to occur during nonREM sleep and could occur during any part of the night. In others,enuresis reportedly was caused by a mild disturbance in arousal, based on the finding that activation of the arousal center proceeded correctly, but the transition from light sleep to complete awakening was not achieved properly. In a subset of patients, the arousal center in the brain failed to activate, despite proper full bladder sensation. There is conflicting evidence that children who have enuresis may exhibit other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. A recurrent theme in sleep research is the child's inability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder during sleep and failure to awaken from sleep to urinate in an appropriate place. There appears to be a maturational pattern of progressive central nervous system \"recognition\" of bladder fullness and control over the micturition reflex.Some children who have enuresis may have a small bladder capacity. Functional bladder capacity in children may be estimated by the formula: age in years plus 2, which gives bladder capacity in ounces. By adolescence, this no longer applies; adult bladder capacity is approximately 10 to 15 oz. Children who have small bladder capacities probably represent a subgroup of patients who have MNE and presumably cannot hold the normal amount of urine produced at night. They are more likely to report frequent daytime voiding,some nights with multiple episodes of enuresis per night, and no history of attaining dryness.In some children who have normal bladder capacities,urgency may play a role in nocturnal enuresis. These children exhibit daytime urgency, but they can maintain bladder control during the day. They have a pattern of partial emptying of the bladder that results in frequent daytime urination to maintain continence and enuresis occurring at night when they cannot void as often. No evidence supports abnormal urodynamics in children who have MNE. Involuntary nighttime voiding in those who have MNE occurs with a urodynamically normal bladder at functional capacity. Because most patients who have abnormal urodynamics as an underlying cause for their nighttime enuresis also have daytime symptoms, asking patients about daytime voiding patterns in the initial history is important.Polyuria is defined as excessive urine production. It may be associated with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Caffeine,alcohol, and medications also may cause it. Factors such as irregular food and drink intake and staying up late also may contribute. It seems reasonable to limit fluid intake several hours prior to bedtime because the most common cause of polyuria is habit polydipsia.Since first described in 1985, the theory that MNE is due to nocturnal polyuria with relative nocturnal deficiency of pituitary-produced antidiuretic hormone(ADH) has been controversial. Early studies reported that the plasma level of ADH did not increase during sleep in those who had enuresis compared with a rise in ADH among unaffected children, resulting in relative nocturnal polyuria as a factor in enuresis. Studies documenting the percentage of children who have enuresis and lack a nocturnal surge in ADH ranges from 25% to 100%, suggesting the presence of other factors. New research about polyuria and enuresis theorizes that a full bladder might communicate with the kidneys to reduce urine production. Some recent investigations also suggest abnormal osmoregulatory function in the kidney, with higher solute excretion among those who have enuresis.Most children who have enuresis have no psychological disorder. The dated concept that enuresis frequently is due to anxiety or stress is unproven. On the contrary, enuresis creates psychosocial problems for the bed-wetting child, including poor self-esteem,family stress, and social isolation. Secondary enuresis commonly has been attributed to psychological factors. Recent studies show no major psychological differences between children who have secondary enuresis and children who have no enuresis. If a child reverts to bed-wetting during treatment for enuresis or has increased episodes of bed-wetting during times of stress, it is more likely due to poor compliance with treatment. Children who have enuresis not only have lower self-esteem than unaffected children, but they have lower self-esteem than children who have chronic,debilitating illnesses. These study results both emphasize the profound impact that enuresis may have and justify a careful evaluation of psychosocial symptoms in the family and the patient.The fact that most children who have enuresis become dry in time with or without intervention supports maturational delay as a factor in MNE. At age 5 years,15% of children occasionally wet the bed compared with only 10% at 6 years of age. Perhaps development of central nervous system recognition of and response to the sensation of a full bladder is delayed, a concept that correlates strongly with the arousal dysfunction theory. Proposed abnormal urodynamic factors also may normalize as the child becomes older. A similar process of maturation over time is seen in other milestones of normal development,such as the age range of 9 to 15 months at which a child begins to walk. Maturational delay may be the most plausible and unifying concept among proposed etiologic factors in MNE.In addition to a detailed toilet training history, a family history of enuresis should be sought because it rarely is volunteered, even when known by a parent. Other pertinent details of a history include the onset and pattern of wetting, voiding behavior, sleep pattern, parasomnias, medical conditions, daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, and psychosocial factors. It also is important to assess both the family's and the patient's attitude toward the bed-wetting and their readiness to initiate and continue treatment. Questions about voiding patterns may reveal urgency or a history of small, frequent voids that suggests bladder instability or small bladder capacity. Organic causes of enuresis may be apparent by a history of dysuria (urinary tract infection),polyuria and polydipsia (diabetes insipidus or mellitus), encopresis (constipation), abnormal urine stream (lower obstructive lesions), gait disturbances(spinal cord pathology), or nighttime snoring(adenoidal hypertrophy). A thorough and thoughtful history is the means by which the infrequent organic causes of enuresis are separated from the majority of cases that have no organic etiology (TableT1). Most children who have nocturnal enuresis will have normal findings on physical examination. In addition to assessing the child's height, weight, and blood pressure, perform a complete examination, paying careful attention to the urogenital, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems. A palpable bladder or palpable stool may be present on abdominal examination, ectopic ureter or signs of sexual abuse on urogenital examination, or abnormal gait apparent during neurologic examination. Cremasteric, anal, abdominal,and deep tendon reflexes that reflect spinal cord function all should be tested. The skin of the lower back should be inspected for the presence of a sacral dimple, hair patches, or vascular birthmarks, which can be clues to spinal dysraphism. Mouth breathing may suggest sleep apnea with associated enuresis due to adenoidal hypertrophy. Direct observation of the urinary stream in the office is important, especially if findings on the history suggest an abnormality. The family can measure bladder capacity at home prior to the initial evaluation or it can be measured in the office by having the child drink 12 oz of fluid on arrival, then voiding into a calibrated cup.All children who have enuresis should have urinalysis of a clean-catch midstream urine specimen (Fig 2). The ability to concentrate urine to 1.015 or greater rules out diabetes insipidus and the absence of glucose rules out diabetes mellitus as causes of nocturnal enuresis. Further laboratory testing is unnecessary for MNE. A urine culture should be obtained for symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection on history or findings on urinalysis. Routine radiologic or ultrasonographic imaging studies of the urinary tract or cystoscopy are not recommended for children who have MNE. PNE may require further evaluation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), renal and bladder ultrasonography, or urodynamic testing. When enuresis is resistant to treatment and the history suggests a sleep disorder, a sleep study may be useful to look for sleep apnea or parasomnias.An important factor in any pediatric treatment is the child's motivation and acceptance. Parents also must support the child and the treatment program for maximal effectiveness. The child's age is a critical factor when formulating a treatment plan. Consideration of treatment is guided by the clinician's understanding of the changing prevalence of enuresis in school-age children and the effect of enuresis on the child's self-esteem and family function. Timing of the intervention should be tailored to the individual child and family.Although a child's self-esteem can be harmed by MNE, even at early school age, the effects are variable. Some school-age children and their parents are not bothered by the child's enuresis; others experience anxiety and stress. It is reasonable to discuss MNE during a health supervision visit and provide facts for families of patients at 6 or 7 years of age. The maturational aspects of nighttime awakening to void should be explained to parents and likened to other familiar developmental milestones that occur over a range of time rather than at a specific age. Providing plausible medical explanations, identifying a family history of enuresis, and defining its age-specific prevalence may lessen the burden on the child. Parents should understand that punishment or negative reinforcement is counterproductive, both in resolving the enuresis and in protecting the child's self-esteem. For children and families who are bothered by the child's enuresis,targeted intervention is recommended by age 8 years at the latest. In general, MNE should be thoroughly explained, selectively treated, and never ignored.This approach begins with educating parents and the child about enuresis, a process that usually allays guilt. Handouts with printed instructions can teach the parents and the child to manage the condition. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should be taken out of diapers or training pants and encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. The risk of secondary psychological injury to the child's self-esteem is minimized by discouraging ridicule from siblings and by avoiding a critical, demoralizing approach.Because excessive fluid intake before bedtime can cause increased nocturnal urine production, as can caffeinated beverages and certain foods (eg, dairy products, citrus juices, chocolate), restricting fluids for 2 hours prior to bedtime is reasonable. The child should agree to fluid restriction, however, rather than having it imposed. The rate of complete resolution of enuresis with motivational therapy alone is estimated to be only 25%, but up to 70% of children who have MNE have some reduction in the number of wet nights. Once consistently dry nights are achieved, the reported relapse rate is low. Motivational therapy is a reasonable first-line approach, especially with the younger child. If unsuccessful after a trial of 3 to 6 months, a different treatment program should be considered.This approach includes dry-bed training and classic conditioning therapy using an enuresis alarm system. Hypnotherapy also may be part of a comprehensive program to treat enuresis. This therapy involves an age-appropriate explanation of how the brain and bladder communicate, taking the mystery out of enuresis by educating the patient and family, teaching relaxation techniques, and having the child practice imagery of awakening to urinate in the toilet or staying dry all night. It can be combined with an alarm system. Frequent office visits are required initially until the physician is certain that the child can practice imagery at home; then, visits may be monthly. Referral to a behavioral pediatrician or clinic may be necessary if the primary care physician does not have the necessary training or time for this approach.Dry-bed training (as described by Azrin and Thienes in 1978) involves waking the child on a progressive schedule at decreasing intervals over several nights,having the child change pajamas and bedding if wet or walk to the toilet when voiding is needed. As in the use of alarm therapy, the eventual goal is to have the child self-awaken to void. Although a high cure rate is reported with this technique by the authors, it is a more time- and labor-intensive process than most families are willing to undertake.Enuresis alarms have the highest overall cure rate of any available treatment. They also represent the best-researched behavioral intervention. Alarm systems can be used in combination with motivational and other behavioral therapy techniques or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Several different alarm devices range in cost from $50 to $75. Insurance companies may cover an enuresis alarm with a prescription from the physician describing it as a medical device. In contrast to the older bell-and-pad type of alarms, the new devices are portable, small,and worn directly on the child's clothing. They emit a transistorized audio or vibratory alarm when urine is sensed in the underpants.Alarms are most effective when combined with other behavioral or pharmacologic therapy. The alarm wakes the child or parent from sleep, who then implements the appropriate component of the behavioral program. The alarm allows the parent and child to intervene and monitors bed-wetting as the program proceeds. Parents and child should be told that this treatment requires a long-term commitment and may take several months to achieve a cure. The device can be discontinued when the child has had three consecutive weeks of dry nights. The cure rate may be as high as 70% long-term. Among the 10% to 15% of children who relapse,most can be treated successfully with a repeat of the original alarm program.Methods to reduce alarm failure include pretesting the child for his or her ability to awaken to the alarm and encouraging parents and child to continue using the alarm. Failure also can be reduced by enabling the child who is afraid of the dark to walk to the toilet using a flashlight or night light in the room or by offering other options to the child who is reluctant to try an enuresis alarm. If a child does not awaken to the alarm during pretesting, dry-bed training or parent awakening should precede the use of the alarm. One study showed that an ordinary alarm clock used with dry-bed training was as effective as an enuresis alarm. This may be an attractive alternative to families who cannot afford an alarm or whose insurance will not cover it.(See the 1997 Pediatrics in Review article by Schmitt for practical tips on successful use of the enuresis alarm.)Medication is an attractive treatment modality for parents who hope for relatively effortless success. However, medication alone for initial treatment of nocturnal enuresis is never preferred and seldom should be considered before 8 years of age, even in combination therapy. Three drugs are used most commonly for the treatment of enuresis: imipramine, desmopressin(DDAVP), and oxybutynin. Imipramine and DDAVP have been evaluated in the treatment of MNE; oxybutynin is used primarily in polysymptomatic enuresis.Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used for more than 3 decades to treat nocturnal enuresis. It appears to increase bladder capacity through a weak anticholinergic effect and also may decrease detrusor muscle contractions via noradrenergic effects. The starting dose is 25 mg taken 1 hour before bedtime for children ages 6 to 8 years and 50 to 75 mg for older children and adolescents. The duration of action is 8 to 12 hours. The dose may be increased in 25-mg increments weekly up to 75 mg. Therapy may continue from 3 to 9 months, with a slow tapering of medication recommended over 3 to 4 weeks in 25-mg decrements. Imipramine is relatively inexpensive,and the clinical response is usually apparent during the first week of treatment. The initial success rate(dry at 6 months posttreatment) is reported to be 15% to 50%, but the relapse rate is high following drug discontinuation.When used at the recommended dosage, mild side effects include irritability, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbances. An accidental or intentional overdose, however, can have serious and potentially lethal effects, including ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Because of its narrow toxic/therapeutic ratio, some clinicians are understandably reluctant to use imipramine to treat a relatively benign, self-limiting condition such as nocturnal enuresis. If imipramine therapy is selected,the physician must counsel the family carefully about the dangerous potential of its accidental ingestion,safe storage of the drug, and supervision of the child taking the medication.DDAVP is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin (ADH). Acting on the distal tubules of the kidney, it increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, producing a more concentrated, lower volume of urine. The use of DDAVP to treat nocturnal enuresis is based on the observation that some children who have enuresis do not have the normal nocturnal rise in ADH production, potentially leading to polyuria. DDAVP theoretically reduces urine volume at night in such children, who thereby can avoid a full bladder at night.DDAVP is available in an oral form and a nasal spray. The bioavailability is only 1% for the tablet and 10% for the nasal spray. Its duration of action is extended (approximately 10 to 12 h), and it is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa. The initial dose of DDAVP is 20 mcg or one 10-mcg puff in each nostril within 2 hours of bedtime, regardless of the patient's age. The dose may be increased in increments of 10 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 40 mcg. The response to DDAVP usually can be evaluated within a few days of starting therapy. Patients may remain on medication for 3 to 6 months,then should begin a slow decrease of the dose by 10 mcg/mo. If a child remains enuretic after 6 months of therapy, combination therapy may be considered. If oral medication is preferred, the starting dose is 0.2 mg(one tablet) administered 1 hour before bedtime. If there is no response within 1 week, the dose can be titrated by 0.2 mg up to a maximum of 0.6 mg nightly.Side effects of DDAVP are rare and include abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache, and epistaxis. Symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures has been reported very rarely, usually in the context of exceeding the recommended dosage. Nonetheless,nighttime fluid restriction is a reasonable recommendation for those receiving DDAVP. Contraindications include habit polydipsia,hypertension, and heart disease. There are few data on long-term use of DDAVP. In a Swedish study that monitored children who had MNE, 22% became dry with DDAVP, a response not significantly different from the spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year. All patients, however, had a marked reduction in the number of enuretic events per month. More patients remained dry after slow tapering of the DDAVP dose than following abrupt discontinuation of the medicine. Various studies show immediate response rates as high as 70% and relapse rates as high as 95%. Moffat et al reviewed 18 controlled studies of DDAVP and found overall that only 25% of children were completely dry on the medicine, with a relapse rate similar to that noted previously.DDAVP's high initial response rate is attractive for episodic use to treat enuresis, alone or in combination with other treatments. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis. DDAVP also may be useful to bridge the gap between enuresis and dryness during other treatments. Using DDAVP episodically also reduces its rather significant cost, which may be $150 to$250 for 1 month of nightly use.Oxybutynin chloride is an anticholinergic and antispasmodic drug that has a role in reducing uninhibited bladder contractions. It is used primarily to treat children who have symptoms of daytime urgency or frequency in addition to nighttime enuresis. It appears to be no better than placebo in treating children who have MNE. Side effects are related to the anticholinergic action of the drug and include flushing, blurred vision, constipation, tremor, and decreased ability to sweat. The recommended starting dose is 5 to 10 mg/d (or 0.1 mg/kg) for most children. This drug is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat enuresis in children younger than 5 years of age. Hyoscyamine is another anticholinergic agent used to treat bladder instability that recently has received attention in clinical studies on enuresis. These medications may play a role in the treatment of PNE.As a condition that has no single etiology and various causal factors in any one patient, it is not surprising that a single method of treating nocturnal enuresis is often of limited success. Age-related strategies that combine more than one treatment may improve response rates.For young children and their parents, reassurance and education about enuresis are of utmost importance. They must understand that nocturnal wetting is not the child's fault. There is no place for ridicule or a punitive approach to the problem by parents, siblings,or peers. Previously described motivational and behavioral methods that assist the child in waking to void and that praise successful dryness suit this age group best.For children who still have nocturnal enuresis at this age and for whom the child and family request an intervention, the enuresis alarm gives the best results in terms of response rate and low relapse rate. This also is the age at which intermittent use of medication such as DDAVP can be useful for special events such as an overnight at a friend's home or a camping trip.Because of the emotional impact of persistent bed-wetting in adolescence, aggressive intervention is indicated. If use of an enuresis alarm does not stop or greatly reduce the wetting episodes, continuous use of medication is justified as additional treatment. When 2 months of dryness using the combination of alarm and medication are achieved, the medication should be tapered gradually while continuing to use the enuresis alarm.Assessments of treatment results of enuresis must consider the rate of initial response, the duration of response, and the relapse rate. In general, studies comparing an alarm system with placebo or drug therapy show the alarm system to have the most favorable combination of initial response rate (60% to 70%) and relapse rate (10% to 30%), especially when dryness is assessed at 12 months after initiating treatment. The success rate with alarms, of course, depends on continued use of the alarm. A significant number of families (30% to 50%) discontinue use of the alarm within only 2 to 3 weeks. Studies evaluating medication alone compared with placebo show favorable initial response(10% to 60%), but a significant relapse rate (80% to 90%) when the child is off medication. Two studies documented identical rates of 56% of children maintaining dryness after 12 months' use of an alarm system. In both studies,the rate of dryness after 12 months when using medication alone, either imipramine or DDAVP, was no better than the expected improvement rate of about 15% with no treatment.Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem seen by the primary care physician. It remains a source of considerable anxiety for the child, parents, and sometimes the pediatrician. In spite of several decades of research, no single explanation or classification of enuresis is sufficient. The nocturnal wetting episode occurs when the child does not awaken during sleep at a time when urine volume exceeds functional bladder capacity, due either to excess urine production, small bladder capacity, or both. This perspective requires the practitioner to take a careful history for polyuria, sleep dysfunction, and daytime bladder symptoms to devise the best treatment for each child. Once organic causes are ruled out by careful history and physical examination, no laboratory or radiographic evaluation is necessary beyond a simple urinalysis. Although a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year can be expected, intervention may benefit some children through earlier attained dryness and improved self-esteem. Behavior therapies, including alarm systems, have the best long-term results, but they require strong family commitment and do not offer immediate results. Medication has a better short-term cure rate than motivational/behavioral therapy, but relapse rates are high when drugs are discontinued. A combination of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is reasonable if monotherapy fails. The ultimate goal is for the child to maintain nighttime dryness or to self-awaken to void at night.",

      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "title": "Experiences of 'control' in anorexia nervosa treatment: delayed coercion, shadow of law or disseminated power and control?",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is often chronic, with one of highest death rates for psychological conditions. Law can compel treatment, but is rarely invoked, at least formally (though strategic possibilities of orders confers internal authority within clinical setting). Instead, control (or management) is exercised diffusely, through disciplinary embedded in everyday clinic life, such as daily routines of eating and washing, behavioural contracts, regular surveillance and measuring, interactions with staff, visits and activities. The regulatory regime not only touches on such practices but also targets identities (including self-image, and attitudes to body) and what Goffman called moral career of (eg learning to play patient to be an anorexic). We argue that it is not clumsiness of or success of less restrictive options which explains why law is so infrequently engaged. Rather, based on an interpretation of Foucault, we concluded that regulatory regimes that shape treatment of anorexia nervosa, is the law, in a sense. The regime of governmentality within clinic is shaped by which operationalise duty of care, or translate medical expertise into medical authority, or show how interactions between experts, carers and patients are mediated through conventions and rules, or which conscript empowerment as control. The learns to provide consent freely, to make correct choices, to accept empowerment regime that is made even more convincing by threat of legal intervention. In time constraints learned in this way become part of new role, that of recovering patient. The fiction of acting responsibly, employed so hesitantly at first, becomes part of new identity.

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition which causes progressive weakness, with normal sensation. It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur.

      "title": "Case of Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia - Continuum Through Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

      "title": "Migraine in Children",
      "abstract": "Up to 1 in 10 children will develop migraines, and their symptoms may not resemble the migraines that their parents and other adults experience. Migraine is the most common recurring headache type that occurs in children. Children may be less able to describe the symptoms they are having in terms that adults understand. For example, children may be irritable, start vomiting, and hold their heads, without using the word “headache.” There may be frequent absences from school for stomach issues and not wanting to get up for school, without a clear description of pain. Abdominal pain is a common migraine symptom in children, not usually seen in adult migraineurs. Children with migraine often get complete relief of their migraine with sleep or by a single episode of vomiting. The criteria for migraine diagnosis, outlined by the most recent International Classification of Headache Disorders (3rd Ed. Beta version) states that children's migraines can have a duration of only 2 hours, unlike the adult migraine, which must last at least 4 hours. As with adult migraine, migraine attacks can last up to 3 days. Both children and adults need to have at least 5 attacks, meeting at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: one-sided (more often bilateral in children), pulsating or throbbing pain, moderate to severe intensity, and worsened by routine activity. In addition, migraines in both children and adults must have either light and sound sensitivity, or nausea or vomiting. In children, these symptoms may be inferred by their behavior. Treatment in children often starts with the mildest of interventions, and only when and if these are ineffective, prescription medications specific to migraine are started. It can be helpful to mark on a calendar the days each month that a child has migraine to help determine triggers for when they occur. For example, it might be seen that the headaches are triggered by lack of sleep, and setting up a structured bedtime with adequate rest can be useful. Regular meal times and stress management can be helpful. A headache diary identifying the frequency, severity, and factors that seem to trigger or relieve headaches in a child can make the visit to a headache treating provider more valuable. When medication is found to be necessary, typically acetaminophen 10-20 mg/kg is the first tried. If this appears ineffective, ibuprofen at 10 mg/kg is often the next step. This dose may be repeated in 4-6 hours if needed. If the child is vomiting, rectal promethazine at 0.25-0.5 mg/kg may be used. This can help the child sleep, as well as help with migraine-associated nausea and vomiting. Promethazine can also be given in pill form for nausea without vomiting. Often, as the child approaches adolescence, these over-the-counter medications become less effective, and a migraine-specific medication may be started. The onset of menstruation is a major risk factor for migraine onset or worsening, so adolescent migraine is common, and the headaches tend to be worse before and during the menstrual period. The class of migraine prescription treatment most commonly initiated after the over-the-counter options have failed resembles those frequently used in adult migraineurs. Triptans, specifically formulated for treatment of migraine, target the brain's pain receptors activated in migraine attacks. Rizatriptan is the only FDA approved triptan for all children ages 6-17. Smaller children weighing 20-39 kg are approved for lower dose rizatriptan at 5 mg. Almotriptan is FDA approved for children 12-17. Sumatriptan–naproxen is a single tablet that combines a triptan with naproxen sodium, an anti-inflammatory similar to ibuprofen, and it is FDA approved for 12-17 year olds. No form of sumatriptan other than the combination with naproxen sodium is FDA approved for children. Sumatriptan is often prescribed in children, however, starting with the oral 25 mg dose, and then increasing the dose as the child ages into adulthood, where the typical dose is 100 mg. Triptan nasal sprays may be particularly helpful for the child who is vomiting with their attacks, although many children will not agree to this formulation or tolerate it. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is FDA approved for children 12 and older. Sumatriptan nasal spray is approved for adolescents in the European Union, but is not US FDA approved in children. It is important to note that sumatriptan nasal spray is the only nasal spray rated with Class I Level A evidence for adolescents by the American Academy of Neurology Evidence-Based Guidelines. Zolmitriptan comes in tablet, melt form, and nasal spray, making it a versatile option for those who sometimes vomit with their migraines. However, as noted, only the nasal spray formulation is FDA approved for children 12 years and older. The 5 mg dose is generally used. The zolmitriptan nasal spray does not taste as bad as the sumatriptan nasal spray. The zolmitriptan tablet is only approved for adults 18 years and older. What happens when the headache calendar shows headaches occurring very frequently? First, identifying triggers and avoiding those if at all possible is recommended. Getting a good night's sleep, regular meals, and a healthy diet can go a long way toward helping. Behavioral and non-drug therapies are often very helpful in children and can be used before medications. If the headaches remain frequent, prevention with a medication may be recommended to avoid medication overuse or missing out on too many activities with school and friends. Medication overuse can occur in children as well as adults, and lead to more headaches that are harder to treat. A rule of thumb is that if as-needed medications are being used more than 2 days a week or 10 days per month, they can actually increase headache frequency. This is also when preventive medications may be considered. Low side-effect prevention medications are usually started first. Clear evidence that these are effective in children and adolescents has not yet been found, and therefore keeping a calendar of headache frequency before and while taking them is particularly important to see if they work for a child. It is important to state the there are no prescription medications that are FDA approved for pediatric migraine prevention other than topiramate, which is only approved in those 12-17 years old. A recent study in children and adolescents taking the standard migraine preventive medications, topiramate or amitriptyline, found them to be no more effective than taking placebo (not active) pill over a 6-month time period. However, there may have been problems with this study, and these medications are still widely used in children for migraine prevention. Before medications, or with medications, non-drug, or what is called an interdisciplinary approach of a structured schedule, sleep, and mealtimes, exercise, relaxation, and non-drug pain management strategies are often the first line preventive strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be especially effective in children and adolescents. If preventive medications are needed, often low side effect supplements are considered, although the evidence for their effectiveness is not strong in children. Magnesium, riboflavin, and CoenzymeQ10 (CoQ10) are examples. If no benefit is seen with supplements, topiramate may be started. It is started at a low dose and slowly increased. Doses greater than 100 mg should be avoided for migraine prevention because of the increased risk of side effects. It is important to keep an eye out for problems with schoolwork, memory, appetite, and mood when taking this medication, as side effects are not uncommon. Other preventive medications commonly used in children but not FDA approved include blood pressure medications such as beta blockers (propranolol) and antidepressant medications such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline. Beta blockers can lead to a low blood pressure or difficulty with athletic stamina. The antidepressant medications can lead to undesirable mood changes, fatigue, and weight gain in some children. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine, has also been used in children for migraine prevention. It can be helpful for sleep, but it too can lead to weight gain. Ultimately, the goals of migraine treatment are to normalize a child's life such that they do the activities typical for their age without migraines getting in the way. Medications should help, not hinder, this process. Using a minimum of medications, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle with excellent diet, exercise, and rest go a long way toward helping the child with migraine meet these goals. Deborah E.

      "abstract": "The refusal of food by an insane patient is a troublesome and frequently a serious matter, partly because, from the absence of symptoms in most cases, it is difficult to arrive at a diagnosis of its cause. In many instances it may reasonably be supposed that subjective feelings of pain or discomfort in the stomach, leading to the refusal of food, arise from organic disease or functional disorder of that organ. That there is a centre in the brain, disorder of which causes a distaste for food, has been suggested, but is scarcely worthy of serious consideration. The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

Other reports of withdrawal-like phenomena following acute and chronic intoxication are reviewed and discussed. It is the authors' opinion, based on strong clinical evidence, that glutethimide, like other sedatives, can produce tolerance, habituation, and addiction in some subjects when taken in amounts greater than 2.5 gm. daily.

It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

Satiety is the quality or state of being fed or gratified to or beyond capacity mediated in the short term by mechanical factors related to swallowing and gastric distention, chemical factors related to taste and smell, and psychological factors (sensory-specific satiety) and in the long term by chemoreception of nutrients and gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and neuroendocrine and neuronal factors and is a major motivation for terminating eating (1).",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

      "title": "Adolescent Bulimia Nervosa—Part 2: A Proposed Group Nursing Intervention",
      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) is the most common eating disorder noted in the female adolescent and college-age population. BN develops like other self-destructive substance addictions and often runs a chronic and relapsing course. The potentially irrevocable effects, including death, of BN on the growth and development of adolescents emphasize the importance of providing appropriate nursing interventions for this population. This proposed nursing plan of care for female adolescent suffering with BN is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model and incorporates aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. This group plan was developed to provide a framework or foundation for nurses working with this population. Future practice and research recommendations are also presented. Bulimia nervosa (BN) develops like other self-destructive substance addictions. The bulimic behavior may begin with a specialized trigger (dieting-binging-purging), but the trigger tends to broaden gradually to encompass other emotional or social stimuli (e.g., feeling depressed or anxious). This results not only because of physiologic effects on the body, but also secondary to learned responses (Riley, 1991). The framework for this proposed nursing plan of care for adolescents suffering with BN, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model (1984). This outpatient group plan incorporates many aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. The plan outlined in this article is offered as a foundation for nursing practice and research development. Within an addiction model, BN is viewed as a primary, chronic, and progressive illness from which individuals can be helped to physical, psychological, and spiritual recovery. Key to the addiction model is the disease concept. This concept defines BN as an involuntary, biopsychological state and lifts from the person the responsibility and guilt for the development of the disease, but emphasizes the need for responsible management of the problem once it exists. Because many bulimics are embarrassed by their inabilities to control food intake, the disease concept helps break through the denial surrounding the illness. Denial perpetuates the disease and associated feelings of depression, shame, and powerlessness (Riley, 1991). The group context provides a safe, supportive, and empathetic environment in which group members are guided to challenge each other's denial, magical thinking, and other cognitive and behavior mal-adaptations (Riley, 1991). Adolescents place special importance on what their peers think is acceptable, thereby learning that their problems, including bulimia, are not unique fosters sharing with less denial (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Finding out they are not alone produces a tremendous sense of relief and instills hope (Riley, 1991). Group therapists working with adolescents must be active in setting boundaries and rules, and initially are more directive. This directiveness should lessen as the group matures and its climate begins to favor self-closure and problem solving (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Therapists must also be aware of the potential for group members' sharing of maladaptive behaviors, such as purging methods and stealing techniques (Pilote, 1998). These behaviors should be immediately confronted within the group.",

An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by unrelenting self-starvation and lifethreatening weight loss. The relentlessness with which individuals with anorexia nervosa pursue starvation and in some cases exercise despite the negative physical, emotional, and social consequences parallels features of addictive disorders. From a clinical perspective, individuals with anorexia nervosa behave similarly to individuals with substance abuse by narrowing their behavioral repertoire so that weight loss, restricting food intake, and excessive exercise interfere with other activities in much the same way that substance abuse does. However, fundamental differences exist between anorexia nervosa and substance abuse that suggest anorexia nervosa is not an addiction in and of itself.",

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

While the disorder as seen in the clinic is much less common in males than females this may not be a true reflection of the differential sex or overall prevalence rates. The disorder is found to have the same basic characteristics in the male as in the female: namely, a phobic avoidance of normal weight associated with elective carbohydrate starvation and emaciation. As in the female the mechanism appears to develop out of normal adolescent dieting behaviour and to arise as a means of avoiding overwhelming psychosocial maturational demands of adolescence. Premorbid and family features include a state of overnutrition and a high degree of family psychopathology reflected in high rates of parental psychiatric morbidity and marital difficulty.",

(2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

      "abstract": "Do you gauge the success of your workout based on your soreness level? Some people wear their postworkout muscular discomfort like a badge of honor. Here’s what’s really happening, why it’s happening, and when enough is enough. WHAT’S HAPPENING When you participate in physical activity, particularly a new activity, it is common to experience some muscle soreness or discomfort. Any type of activity that places a new stress or load on a muscle may lead to delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). As its name implies, DOMS is delayed soreness that is different from the discomfort you may experience during exercise. When the muscle is asked to do too much too soon, small microtears occur in the muscle fiber. This is quite normal as long as the soreness is minor. This is how muscles adapt to increased demands. WHAT TO EXPECT Delayed soreness is unique to each individual, but most individuals experience symptoms 12 to 24 hours after the exercise was performed, and it may continue for up to 72 hours after exercise. It is helpful to understand how your body manages this process, and it is vital to start out slowly when embracing a new exercise regime. Activities that involve a high number of repetitions will produce more soreness than a low number of repetitions. Choose quality over quantity, and avoid the temptation to overdo it until your body has adapted to the activity. Certain activities like plyometrics and running downhill are well known for producing DOMS because the muscle is stressed during its lengthening phase (eccentric contraction), and that will cause more soreness. STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS When starting a new activity, less is more. Progress slowly. Try small bouts of exercise at first. Make sure you give your body 2 or 3 days of rest before repeating the same exercise. You can do other exercises but avoid repeating the same exercises day after day. Take extra time to warm up and spend time cooling down. Perform flexibility exercises that stretch the muscles used during exercise. Understand that you don’t need to be sore to benefit from exercise. In fact, too much soreness can be damaging and debilitating. Work under the guidance of an ACSM certified fitness professional. WHEN ENOUGH IS ENOUGH If you are perpetually sore, that is a sign that you are overdoing it. Reduce the frequency of your workouts and allow more rest between sessions. If the pain becomes unbearable, if your urine is dark, or if there is swelling of the arms and legs, you should seek medical attention. As the national group fitness director for Optum, Grace T. DeSimone, B.A., and her group fitness teams manage group exercise classes in worksite wellness programs across the country. She serves on the executive council of ACSM’s Committee on Certification and Registry Boards.

Within the exercise-induced anaphylaxis syndrome two well differentiated clinical forms are included: systemic cholinergic urticaria and exercise-induced anaphylaxis in the strict sense which can be shown by a classic form or a variant form, more uncommon and with manifestations similar to cholinergic urticaria. Postprandial or food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a frequently identified subtype of these last cases. It can be due to an asymptomatic food allergy manifested through physical effort, although in many occasions it is not possible to find a responsible allergen. The diagnosis is settled on the clinical history and specific tests with food allergens. It can be necessary to perform an exercise challenge test with and without previous ingestion. The treatment is preventive and it is based on avoiding the food or the food allergen some hours before the exercise. When it does not depend on foods it is used a prophylactic pharmacotherapy with antihistamines, cromones or sodium bicarbonate. The patient should be well educated on the use of epinephrine in the event of new reactions.",

In the absence of identifiable cause for their child symptoms and the apparent feed/symptom association, the family wanted to explore all options, including parenteral nutrition (PN).\n\nNeurodisability is an umbrella term used to describe a heterogeneous group affected by central nervous and/or neuromuscular deficit. Their motor functional output can be objectively assessed by Gross Motor Functional Classification,1 but the group comprises a diverse and often overlapping range of difficulties. The enteric nervous system, a semiautonomous part of the nervous system responsible for regulating the gastrointestinal (GI) function, is invariably affected with neurodisabilities and can drive some GI complaints.2 With increasing longevity of children on the extreme end of neurodisability, a new chapter of complex GI symptoms begins to unravel, and novel terminologies, such as GI dystonia, although poorly understood, are fast becoming embedded in medical jargons.\n\nPN is classically used to provide nutrition when the GI tract is unable to support sufficient nourishment. In most children, the requirement of PN is temporary, but minority will need long-term nutritional support, home PN and intestinal transplantation.3 In the neurologically able child, healthcare professionals can navigate this journey supported with guidelines and a plethora of evidence,4 but are left to the ambiguity of anecdotal evidence and personal experience to deal with the neurodisabled child who develops declining gut function, leading to variation in practice and divergence of care.\n\nWith the right level of multidisciplinary support and nutrition support teams, PN can sustain the nutritional need throughout childhood and transition to …",

      "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarilydelta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "A substantial portion of all the deaths reviewed by medical examiners and coroners relates to the use of cocaine and other illicit drugs (1). Not surprisingly, because of the illegality of these substances, many of these individuals die while in the custody of law enforcement. In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

Examples include a tension headache or a gastrointestinal symptom (such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea) that is triggered or exacerbated by a stressful event (such as a school test or a family argument). The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

Such individuals feel exempt from the human physiological limitations and feel they can eat without gaining weight, or they perceive their body image as slender rather than obese. Any therapeutic program must take into account this aspect of grandiosity, which is at the core of many addictive processes.

      "abstract": "Acute, intermittent and recurrent convulsive seizures have been induced in monkeys by the application of discs containing various immunologically and chemically active substances to the cerebral cortex overlying the motor area. Acute seizures were either single attacks, or a series which usually terminated within one week of onset. Intermittent seizures occurred at widely-spaced intervals over a period of weeks or months. Recurrent seizures were frequent in occurrence (often daily) and persisted for many months. The seizures induced were either typically Jacksonian in nature, or generalized, and usually lasted one-half to two minutes. During unilateral seizures the attack was confined to the muscle groups on the side of the body contralateral to the treated cerebral hemisphere. Seizures occurred either spontaneously, or were induced by external stimuli. Egg-white placed on the brain of monkeys generally sensitized to egg-white, or egg-white injected intravenously into animals in which egg-white had previously been applied to the cortex, yielded acute seizures. Egg-white, egg-white followed by anti-egg-white rabbit serum, specific antigen-antibody precipitates, and typhoid vaccine proved to be effective agents in the production of intermittent seizures. Hydrous oxides of aluminum, alone or in combination with various proteins, invariably produced convulsive seizures, often recurring for many months (in one instance for more than one year to date). These recurrent seizures were of special interest since they represented a state of chronic convulsive reactivity. Control preparations of aquaphor, alone or in combination with rabbit serum, monkey serum or gelatin, or empty discs failed to induce seizures. Electric shock revealed a lowered threshold of convulsive reactivity of one motor area as compared with the other in monkeys exhibiting either unilateral or predominantly unilateral seizures. Electroencephalography indicated that the greatest degree of abnormality in monkeys with convulsive seizures was observed in the precentral cortex and the immediately surrounding area. The recordings also established differences between the two motor areas which were correlated with differences in the clinical manifestations observed on the opposite sides of the body. Luminal and dilantin were found to reduce the incidence of the recurrent seizures produced. Serologic studies revealed no correlation between the concentration of serum precipitins or agglutinins and the occurrence of seizures. Brain antibodies were not demonstrable. The histopathologic findings were of two main types: (1) an acute, destructive process; (2) a chronic, proliferative type of response. The acute lesion was usually associated with the acute or intermittent convulsive seizures produced by immunologic agents. The chronic pathologic response was found in monkeys treated with alumina, aquaphor preparations or empty discs, and was not pathognomonic of the convulsive state. Repeated convulsive seizures have been produced by a single application of various types of substances to the cerebral cortex. Although the mechanism remains obscure, the methods employed may prove useful in further studies of the nature of the convulsive state.",

The distinction between ON and eating disorders involving obsessions about weight and shape and restrictive eating motivated by fear of weight gain is less clear. In this chapter, ON and related eating disorder symptoms associated with the diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder are conceptualized as obsessive-compulsive phenomena. Special considerations for exposure and response interventions for patients with clinically significant restrictive eating are described, including recommendations for when to refer patients to eating disorder specialists.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common clinical issue with varying definitions depending on the source. The DSM-V defines insomnia disorder as one or more of: difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning wakening with an inability to fall back asleep. These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

A food-dependent form of exercise-induced ­anaphylaxis also exists, in which symptoms develop only if the patient has eaten in the hours immediately preceding exercise. In most patients with the food-dependent form, only a specific food(s) will elicit symptoms when combined with exercise, and patients usually have demonstrable IgE to this food. Attacks of exercise-induced anaphylaxis are unpredictable. Management of these disorders involves teaching the patient to stop exercise immediately at the first sign of symptoms and preparing them to self-administer intramuscular epinephrine if needed. Depending on the role of food, patients may need to avoid the culprit food for 4–6 h before exercise, remove the food from their diet altogether, or avoid ingesting any food for several hours before exercise. Pharmacotherapy to prevent attacks has been generally disappointing, although some patients with the food-dependent form may be helped by oral cromolyn, taken before meals. Most patients report fewer attacks over time.",

      "title": "Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

In one case in the asylum this mode of treatment is, when occasion requires it, particularly successful. The patient, either in wanton mischief, or in retaliation for some imagined slight or necessary exercise of discipline, either tears blankets or rugs to shreds, or cunningly strips off narrow pieces from their edges, so that for a time his ravages may go on unobserved. Three-quarters of a grain of hyoscyamine invariably put a stop to the intense and aggressive excitement, to which follows the detection of his wantonness, and the dose keeps him under control for about a month or six weeks, when the memory of his prostration requires to be revived by a repetition of it.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

Muchas veces no queda mas remedio que incluir al paciente en una de esas categorias, empleando criterios subjetivos, ya que los casos intermedios son muy corrientes. Dentro del grupo de los dependientes pueden delimitarse diferentes tipos de adiccion (WHO), segun la existencia de dependencia fisica o psiquica.\nLa dependencia de la heroina se define desde la novena revision de la ICD como forma de dependencia a farmacos y drogas.\nSegun esta definicion, la dependencia (antiguamente adiccion) es un estadio principalmente psiquico al que puede asociarse simultaneamente tambien una dependencia fisica, frecuentemente relacionada con la aparicion de tolerancia. Es necesario llamar la atencion sobre este hecho, ya que muchas veces se cre que la dependencia supone en todas los casos una dependencia fisica unida a la necesidad de aumentar la dosis de la droga. Por el contrario, a veces se descarta erroneamente la existencia de dependencia cuando no se observa un incremento en la dosificacion. \nSe ha descrito ademas una serie de trastornos que aumentan la necesidad de administrarse el medicamento o la droga independientemente del tiempo de evolucion de la dependencia. Uno de los factores esenciales que determina esta compulsion es la aparicion de sensaciones desagradables (disforia) cuando no se administra el farmaco o la droga.",

The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep.

      "title": "Ajirna: An Ayurvedic perspective on Indigestion",
      "abstract": "Ayurveda emphasizes the central role of Agni (digestive fire) in maintaining overall health and well-being. Ajirna (indigestion) is a pathological state arising due to the impairment of Agni, leading to the formation of Ama (undigested metabolic toxins), which serves as a precursor to various systemic diseases. The primary etiological factors of Ajirna include improper dietary habits (Ahara), an unhealthy lifestyle (Vihara), and psychological disturbances (Manasika Bhava). Classical Ayurvedic texts, including the Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya, classify Ajirna into different types based on Dosha predominance, namely Amajirna (Kapha-dominant), Vidagdhajirna (Pitta-dominant), and Vishtabdhajirna (Vata-dominant), along with other forms such as Rasasheshajirna, Dinapaki Ajirna, and Vilambika Ajirna. The dysfunction of Agni results in three pathological states: Mandagni (weakened digestion), Tikshnagni (hyperactive digestion), and Vishamagni (irregular digestion), all of which contribute to digestive disorders. The management of Ajirna in Ayurveda focuses on restoring Agni, eliminating Ama, and correcting underlying lifestyle and dietary imbalances. Therapeutic approaches include Langhana (fasting), Deepana (appetite-stimulating), Pachana (digestive aids), and Vatanulomana (regulation of Vata movement), along with Panchakarma therapies and Pathya-Apathya (dietary and lifestyle modifications). This paper aims to comprehensively explore Ajirna from an Ayurvedic perspective by integrating classical textual references with evidence-based therapeutic interventions for sustainable digestive health.",

The costs of this care can be documented in several different ways—financial, time spent in the caregiving role, and strain or burden on the caregiver. This strain and burden on caregivers can manifest in a variety of ways, including increased use of prescribed medication and more primary care visits (Haley, 1997). Vulnerability to strain is heightened by a previous history of psychiatric disorder in the caregiver (Baumgarten et al., 1992; Hooker, 1992). Depression is a particularly common accompaniment to the caregiving role, affecting between 25% and 70% of caregivers (Dura et al., 1990; Teri, 1994). Physical manifestations of caregiving burden include impaired immune function, elevated blood pressure, abnormal plasma lipid levels, and poor self-care (e.g., sleeplessness and lack of exercise) (Haley, 1997).",

By studying these disorders, we have been able to notice the existence of common psycho-pathological characteristics. Impulsive behavior, more or less compulsive eating habits, and the presence of certain personality traits are different from nervous anorexia according to our study. However, our manner of viewing these disorders consists of considering nervous bulimia and overeating attacks as being clear psychiatric entities, while obesity can be a consequence, or not as seen in the majority of cases, of a psychiatric disorder, although there always exists a special weakness which causes one to suffer from these disorders and there exists a need for psychological support to complement a nutritional treatment program.",

      "abstract": "The clinical features of anorexia nervosa have been clearly described by numerous authorities in the field, such as H. Bruch, A. H. Crisp, P. E. Garfinkel and D. M. Garner, and G. F. M. Russell. The clinical features of the eating disorders comprise features specific to these disorders and features more generally associated with psychological disturbance. The term \"anorexia\" is a misnomer because, except in long-standing cases, appetite for food persists. There is often an obsessional component to these patients' eating habits: they may eat exactly the same food every day, cut up their food into very small pieces, or engage in other ritualistic practices surrounding eating. The principal complaint of patients with bulimia nervosa is that they have lost control of their eating. A central feature of the eating disorders is certain overvalued ideas concerning the importance of shape and weight. A family history of affective disorder is common among patients with eating disorders.",

In this case report, a 13-year-old girl was consulted because she looks sad. A feeling of sadness has been felt for 3 months and has been getting worse since a week ago, which was initially because of T1DM. Patients usually work at home and carry out daily activities as usual. Currently, the patient has no desire and gets tired easily, especially when doing usual activities, thinking the pain will get worse and thinking that she can't recover. Complaints are felt throughout the day and worsen at night, especially before bed or when alone. The patient feels that she is useless and his future is bleak. During pregnancy, the patient's mother routinely checks with the midwife and gets complete immunizations. The patient was born vaginally and cried spontaneously. The patient also received complete basic immunization.",

Polygraphic recordings have defined the electrical and clinical features of these seizures. None of the possible precipitating factors considered in other cases in the literature (chewing, swallowing, conditioned reflex, etc.) seems to be involved in this case.

One of many developmental tasks of childhood and early adolescence is managing the transition from feeding to eating. Over a period of years children with selective eating develop an avoidance reinforced anxiety associated with new foods. There may be anticipatory nausea (with sight or smell triggers), fear of vomiting (textures) or a fear of choking. The term food avoidance emotional disorder (FAED) has mainly been used to describe cases presenting in middle childhood and early adolescence in which age group it may be more common than anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. In some children, food phobias may be a feature of more pervasive anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",

The mechanism by which RS ensues is because of the habitual contraction of the abdominal wall muscles leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure and regurgitation of gastric contents. Therefore, diaphragmatic breathing techniques and biofeedback are helpful in these patients to counteract the habitual abdominal contractions. We present a case of a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with RS unresponsive to conventional therapy (antiemetics and antispasmodics).",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident).

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

La AN tiene importantes repercusiones sobre múltiples órganos y sistemas. Uno de los sistemas más deteriorados es el tejido muscular, lo que a su vez repercute sobre el modelado y remodelado óseo.

Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living.

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a chronic disorder with involuntary motor and vocal tics. Sleep problems are common due to increased tics and comorbid conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Medications to treat tics or insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness. A 14-year-old male presents with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness of more than 1-year onset. He has a past medical history of Tourette syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and adenotonsillectomy due to recurrent pharyngitis. He is homeschooled, and sleeps between 10 pm to 6 – 10 am every day. Naps >2 h every day. Snoring, gasping and sleep talking are reported. His Epworth sleepiness score was 24. He denied hallucinations or cataplexy. He denied alcohol/drug abuse, trauma, hospitalization or family history of narcolepsy. Physical exam was unremarkable except BMI 35.29 kg/m2. His differential included obstructive sleep apnea vs. narcolepsy. His extended release guanfacine to treat tics was stopped, and Neurology held off starting an antidepressant for the sleep studies. The in-lab polysomnography showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index = 0.6/h, Total Sleep Time = 7.8 h, Sleep Latency = 1 min, REM Latency = 47.5 min, Sleep Efficiency = 85%, and Periodic Limb Movement Index = 0/h. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test showed a Mean Sleep Latency in 5 naps = 7 min and Sleep-onset REMs = 3, meeting criteria for narcolepsy. Anti-streptolysin O was less than 200 IU/mL. Guanfacine was switched to nights to reduce daytime sleepiness. Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was started at 5 mg BID due to palpitations and slowly increased to 20 mg extended release in the morning and 10 mg immediate release in the afternoon. Modafinil has also been added, and both sleepiness and tics are under control. This case reminds us that among other sleep related problems, narcolepsy can coexist in Tourette syndrome. It’s interesting that both conditions share an impaired hypothalamus‐hypophysis axis but are not commonly linked together. Management is a concern as stimulants can cause tics. We consider medically appropriate to assess and study their sleep problems and treating with stimulants when necessary to improve quality of life.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Bloating is a frequently reported symptom in functional bowel disorders. It usually occurs in combination with other symptoms, but may also occur in isolation. The severity of bloating tends to worsen during the course of the day and improves overnight. Although frequently considered to be a subjective phenomenon, recent studies have shown that bloating is associated with a measurable increase in abdominal girth. The pathophysiology of bloating remains elusive, but the evidence supports a sensorimotor dysfunction of the bowel. The possible mechanisms include abnormal gas trapping, fluid retention, food intolerance and altered gut microbial flora. Further studies are needed to define the sensorimotor abnormalities associated with bloating, which might be segmental and transient rather than generalized and persistent. The lack of understanding of this symptom is paralleled by a limited availability of therapeutic options. Conventional medications used in functional bowel disorders are not helpful and may indeed worsen the symptoms. In future, new drugs with activity against serotonin and kappa receptors, or novel approaches such as the use of exclusion diets, probiotics and hypnotherapy, may prove to be useful.",

      "title": "Understanding nutrition, depression and mental illnesses",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Few people are aware of the connection between nutrition and depression while they easily understand the connection between nutritional deficiencies and physical illness. Depression is more typically thought of as strictly biochemical-based or emotionally-rooted. On the contrary, nutrition can play a key role in the onset as well as severity and duration of depression. Many of the easily noticeable food patterns that precede depression are the same as those that occur during depression. These may include poor appetite, skipping meals, and a dominant desire for sweet foods.[1] Nutritional neuroscience is an emerging discipline shedding light on the fact that nutritional factors are intertwined with human cognition, behavior, and emotions. The most common mental disorders that are currently prevalent in numerous countries are depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[2] The dietary intake pattern of the general population in many Asian and American countries reflects that they are often deficient in many nutrients, especially essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.[3] A notable feature of the diets of patients suffering from mental disorders is the severity of deficiency in these nutrients.[3] Studies have indicated that daily supplements of vital nutrients are often effective in reducing patients' symptoms.[4] Supplements containing amino acids have also been found to reduce symptoms, as they are converted to neurotransmitters which in turn alleviate depression and other mental health problems.[4] On the basis of accumulating scientific evidence, an effective therapeutic intervention is emerging, namely nutritional supplement/treatment. These may be appropriate for controlling and to some extent, preventing depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders and anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), autism, and addiction.[4] Most prescription drugs, including the common antidepressants lead to side effects.[4] This usually causes the patients to skip taking their medications. Such noncompliance is a common occurrence encountered by psychiatrists. An important point to remember here is that, such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. In some cases, chronic use or higher doses may lead to drug toxicity, which may become life threatening to the patient.[4] An alternate and effective way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to familiarize themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional therapies. Although further research needs to be carried out to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements in the cases of certain nutrients, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained by closely observing the changes in the patient.[4] When we take a close look at the diet of depressed people, an interesting observation is that their nutrition is far from adequate. They make poor food choices and selecting foods that might actually contribute to depression. Recent evidence suggests a link between low levels of serotonin and suicide.[5] It is implicated that lower levels of this neurotransmitter can, in part, lead to an overall insensitivity to future consequences, triggering risky, impulsive and aggressive behaviors which may culminate in suicide, the ultimate act of inwardly directed impulsive aggression. Depression is a disorder associated with major symptoms such as increased sadness and anxiety, loss of appetite, depressed mood, and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities. If there is no timely therapeutic intervention, this disorder can lead to varied consequences. Patients who are suffering from depression exhibit suicidal tendency to a larger degree and hence are usually treated with antidepressants and/or psychotherapy.[6] Deficiencies in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are often associated with depression.[6–11] As reported in several studies, the amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine are often helpful in treating many mood disorders including depression.[12–17] When consumed alone on an empty stomach, tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, is usually converted to serotonin. Hence, tryptophan can induce sleep and tranquility. This implies restoring serotonin levels lead to diminished depression precipitated by serotonin deficiencies.[8] Tyrosine and sometimes its precursor phenylalanine are converted into dopamine and norepinephrine.[18] Dietary supplements containing phenyl alanine and/or tyrosine cause alertness and arousal. Methionine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which facilitates the production of neurotransmitters in the brain.[19–22] The need of the present paradigm is, more studies shedding light on the daily supplemental doses of these neurochemicals that should be consumed to achieve antidepressant effects. Researchers attribute the decline in the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and other sources in most populations to an increasing trend in the incidence of major depression.[23] The two omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which the body converts into docosahexanoic acid (DHA), found in fish oil, have been found to elicit antidepressant effects in human. Many of the proposed mechanisms of this conversion involve neurotransmitters. For instance, antidepressant effects may be due to bioconversion of EPA to leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and other chemicals required by the brain. Others hypothesize that both EPA and DHA influence neuronal signal transduction by activating peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), inhibiting G-proteins and protein kinase C, in addition to calcium, sodium, and potassium ion channels. Whichever may be the case, epidemiological data and clinical studies have clearly shown that omega-3 fatty acids can effectively treat depression.[24] In depressed patients, daily consumption of dietary supplements of omega-3 fatty acid that contain 1.5-2 g of EPA has been shown to stimulate mood elevation. Nevertheless, doses of omega-3 higher than 3 g do not show better effects than placebos and may be contraindicative in cases, such as those taking anticlotting drugs.[25] In addition to omega–3 fatty acids, vitamin B (e.g., folate) and magnesium deficiencies have been linked to depression.[26–28] Randomized, controlled trials that involve folate and vitamin B12 suggest that patients treated with 0.8 mg of folic acid/day or 0.4 mg of vitamin B12/day will exhibit decreased depression symptoms.[27] In addition, the results of several case studies where patients were treated with 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate or taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime led to rapid recovery from major depression in < 7 days for most of the patients. Previous research has revealed the link between nutritional deficiencies and some mental disorders.[232529–32] The most common nutritional deficiencies seen in patients with mental disorders are of omega–3 fatty acids, B vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are precursors to neurotransmitters.[20232427283033] Accumulating evidence from demographic studies indicates a link between high fish consumption and low incidence of mental disorders; this lower incidence rate being the direct result of omega–3 fatty acid intake.[233132] One to two grams of omega-3 fatty acids taken daily is the generally accepted dose for healthy individuals, but for patients with mental disorders, up to 9.6 g has been shown to be safe and effective.[34–36] Majority of Asian diets are usually also lacking in fruits and vegetables, which further lead to mineral and vitamin deficiencies. The significance of various nutrients in mental health, with special relevance to depression has been discussed below. CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates are naturally occurring polysaccharides and play an important role in structure and function of an organism. In higher organisms (human), they have been found to affect mood and behavior. Eating a meal which is rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin in the body. Insulin helps let blood sugar into cells where it can be used for energy and simultaneously it triggers the entry of tryptophan to brain. Tryptophan in the brain affects the neurotransmitters levels. Consumption of diets low in carbohydrate tends to precipitate depression, since the production of brain chemicals serotonin and tryptophan that promote the feeling of well being, is triggered by carbohydrate rich foods. It is suggested that low glycemic index (GI) foods such as some fruits and vegetables, whole grains, pasta, etc. are more likely to provide a moderate but lasting effect on brain chemistry, mood, and energy level than the high GI foods - primarily sweets - that tend to provide immediate but temporary relief. PROTEINS Proteins are made up of amino acids and are important building blocks of life. As many as 12 amino acids are manufactured in the body itself and remaining 8 (essential amino acids) have to be supplied through diet. A high quality protein diet contains all essential amino acids. Foods rich in high quality protein include meats, milk and other dairy products, and eggs. Plant proteins such as beans, peas, and grains may be low in one or two essential amino acids. Protein intake and in turn the individual amino acids can affect the brain functioning and mental health. Many of the neurotransmitters in the brain are made from amino acids. The neurotransmitter dopamine is made from the amino acid tyrosine and the neurotransmitter serotonin is made from the tryptophan.[5] If there is a lack of any of these two amino acids, there will not be enough synthesis of the respective neurotransmitters, which is associated with low mood and aggression in the patients. The excessive buildup of amino acids may also lead to brain damage and mental retardation. For example, excessive buildup of phenylalanine in the individuals with disease called phenylketonuria can cause brain damage and mental retardation. ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS Omega-3 fatty acids The brain is one of the organs with the highest level of lipids (fats). Brain lipids, composed of fatty acids, are structural constituents of membranes. It has been estimated that gray matter contains 50% fatty acids that are polyunsaturated in nature (about 33% belong to the omega-3 family), and hence are supplied through diet. In one of the first experimental demonstrations of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain, the omega-3 fatty acids (specially alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) were the member to take part. An important trend has been observed from the findings of some recent studies that lowering plasma cholesterol by diet and medications increases depression. Among the significant factors involved are the quantity and ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that affect serum lipids and alter the biochemical and biophysical properties of cell membranes. It has been hypothesized that sufficient long chain PUFAs, especially DHA, may decrease the development of depression.[37] The structural and functional components of membrane in cells of brain which is a lipid-rich organ, include polar phospholipids, spingolipids, and cholesterol. The glycerophospholipids in brain consist of high proportion of PUFA derived from the essential fatty acids (EFAs), linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid. The main PUFA in the brain are DHA, derived from the omega-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid (AA) and docosa tetraenoic acid, both derived from omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Experimental studies have revealed that diets lacking omega-3 PUFA lead to considerable disturbance in neural function.[38] Studies by Marszalek and Lodish indicate that despite their abundance in the nervous system, DHA and AA cannot be synthesized by mammals de novo and hence they or their precursors have to be supplied through the diet and transported to the brain. During late gestation and the early postnatal period, neurodevelopment occurs at significantly rapid rates which make the supply of adequate quantity of PUFAs, particularly DHA, imperative to ensure neurite outgrowth in addition to appropriate development of brain and retina.[39] Bruinsma and Taren of University of Arizona College of Public Health, Tucson, USA explored the involvement of dieting-related psychological factors as potential confounders.[40] They discussed studies that have both supported and contested the proposition that lowering plasma cholesterol by diet and medications contributes to depression. Research findings point out that an imbalance in the ratio of the EFAs, namely the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and/or a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids, may be responsible for the heightened depressive symptoms associated with low plasma cholesterol. These relationships may explain the inconsistency in the results of trials on cholesterol-lowering interventions and depression. On similar lines, dieting behaviors have been associated with alterations in moods.[41] Dietary omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the prevention of some disorders including depression. Their deficiency can accelerate cerebral aging by preventing the renewal of membranes. However, the respective roles of the vascular component on one hand (where the omega-3s are active) and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other, have not yet been clearly resolved. The role of omega–3 in certain diseases such as dyslexia and autism is suggested. It was omega–3 fatty acids that participated in the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain. Experiments were first of all carried out on x-vivo cultured brain cells (1), then on in vivo brain cells (2), finally on physicochemical, biochemical, physiological, neurosensory, and behavioral parameters (3). These findings indicated that the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega–3) present in formula milks for infants (both premature and term) determines the visual, cerebral, and intellectual abilities.[16] VITAMINS B-complex vitamins Nutrition and depression are intricately and undeniably linked, as suggested by the mounting evidence by researchers in neuropsychiatry. According to a study reported in Neuropsychobiology,[42] supplementation of nine vitamins, 10 times in excess of normal recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for 1 year improved mood in both men and women. The interesting part was that these changes in mood after a year occurred even though the blood status of nine vitamins reached a plateau after 3 months. This mood improvement was particularly associated with improved vitamin B2 and B6 status. In women, baseline vitamin B1 status was linked with poor mood and an improvement in the same after 3 months was associated with improved mood. Thiamine is known to modulate cognitive performance particularly in the geriatric population.[43] Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamin) Clinical trials have indicated that Vitamin B12 delays the onset of signs of dementia (and blood abnormalities), if it is administered in a precise clinical timing window, before the onset of the first symptoms. Supplementation with cobalamin enhances cerebral and cognitive functions in the elderly; it frequently promotes the functioning of factors related to the frontal lobe, in addition to the language function of people with cognitive disorders. Adolescents who have a borderline level of vitamin B12 deficiency develop signs of cognitive changes.[43] Folate It has been observed that patients with depression have blood folate levels, which are, on an average, 25% lower than healthy controls.[44] Low levels of folate have also been identified as a strong predisposing factor of poor outcome with antidepressant therapy. A controlled study has been reported to have shown that 500 mcg of folic acid enhanced the effectiveness of antidepressant medication.[45] Folate's critical role in brain metabolic pathways has been well recognized by various researchers who have noted that depressive symptoms are the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation of folate deficiency.[46] It is not clear yet whether poor nutrition, as a symptom of depression, causes folate deficiency or primary folate deficiency produces depression and its symptoms. MINERALS Calcium A recent study showed that selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit absorption of calcium into bones. In addition to this, the SSRIs can also lower blood pressure in people, resulting in falls which may lead to broken bones. Indiscriminate prescription of SSRIs by doctors and ingestion by patients at risk of depression or other mental health problems may put them at increased risk of fractures. Compounded by the fact that they may be aging and already taking other medications, may also predispose them to osteoporosis.[47] Chromium Many studies on the association of chromium in humans depression have been recorded[4849] which indicate the significance of this micronutrient in mental health. Iodine Iodine plays an important role in mental health. The iodine provided by the thyroid hormone ensures the energy metabolism of the cerebral cells. During pregnancy, the dietary reduction of iodine induces severe cerebral dysfunction, eventually leading to cretinism. Iron Iron is necessary for oxygenation and to produce energy in the cerebral parenchyma (through cytochrome oxidase), and for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and myelin. Iron deficiency is found in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Iron concentrations in the umbilical artery are critical during the development of the foetus, and in relation with the IQ in the child; Infantile anemia with its associated iron deficiency is associated with disturbance in the development of cognitive functions.[43] Research findings pointed out that twice as many women as men are clinically depressed. This gender difference starts in adolescence and becomes more pronounced among married women aged 25-45, with children. Furthermore, women of childbearing age experience more depression than during other times in their lives. These indicate the possible importance of iron in the etiology of depression since its deficiency is known to cause fatigue and depression. Iron deficiency anemia is associated, for instance, with apathy, depression, and rapid fatigue when exercising.[43] Lithium Lithium, a monovalent cation, was first discovered and defined by Johan August in 1817 while he did an analysis of the mineral petalite. The role of lithium has been well known in psychiatry. Half a century into its use, its choice for bipolar disorder with antimanic, antidepressant, and antisuicidal property. The therapeutic use of lithium also includes its usage as an augmenting agent in depression, scizoaffective disorder, aggression, impulse control disorder, eating disorders, ADDs, and in certain subsets of alcoholism.[50] But adequate care has to be taken while using lithium, the gold standard mood stabilizer, in the mentally ill. Lithium can be used in patients with cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, and dermatological comorbidity. The use of lithium during pregnancy and lactation, in pediatric and geriatric population needs careful observation about its toxicity. Selenium In a large review, Dr. David Benton of the university of Wales identified at least five studies, which indicate that low selenium intake is associated with lowered mood status.[51] Intervention studies with selenium with other patient populations reveal that selenium improves mood and diminishes anxiety.[5253] Zinc Zinc participates among others in the process of gustation (taste perception). At least five studies have shown that zinc levels are lower in those with clinical depression.[54] Furthermore, intervention research shows that oral zinc can influence the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy.[55] Zinc also protects the brain cells against the potential damage caused by free radicals. Several studies have revealed the full genetic potential of the child for physical development and mental development may be compromised due to deficiency (even subclinical) of micronutrients. When children and adolescents with poor nutritional status are exposed to alterations of mental and behavioral functions, they can be corrected by dietary measures, but only to certain extent. It has been observed that, nutrient composition of diet and meal pattern can have beneficial or adverse, immediate or long-term effects. Dietary deficiencies of antioxidants and nutrients (trace elements, vitamins, and nonessential micronutrients such as polyphenols) during aging may precipitate brain diseases, which may be due to failure for protective mechanism against free radicals. OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS Another angle of viewing diet and depression involves old age, which is a time of vulnerability to unintentional weight loss, a factor that is often linked to increased morbidity and premature death. Anorexia of aging may play an important role in precipitating this, by either reducing food intake directly or reducing food intake in response to such adverse factors as age-associated reductions in sensory perception (taste and smell), poor dentition, use of multiple prescription drugs, and depression.[56] Marcus and Berry[57] reviewed malnutrition occurring in the elderly, in both institutional and community settings, due to refusal to eat. They suggest physiologic changes associated with aging, mental disorders such as dementia and depression, and medical, social, and environmental as causative factors. Currently to tackle the problem of depression, people are following the alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) interventions. CAM therapies are defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as a group of diverse medical and health systems, practices, and products that are not currently considered to be a part of conventional medicine.[58] Mental health professionals need to be aware that it is likely that a fair number of their patients with bipolar disorder might use CAM interventions. Some clinicians judge these interventions to be attractive and safe alternatives, or adjuncts to conventional psychotropic medications.[59] Current research in psychoneuroimmunology and brain biochemistry indicates the possibility of communication pathways that can provide a clearer understanding of the association between nutritional intake, central nervous system, and immune function thereby influencing an individual's psychological health status. These findings may lead to greater acceptance of the therapeutic value of dietary intervention among health practitioners and health care providers addressing depression and other psychological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En salud mental es frecuente observar comorbilidad entre trastornos mentales severos y trastornos por uso de sustancias. En estados donde destaca la desinhibición, como la manía en el Trastorno Bipolar, es posible que un paciente no consumidor realice consumos de sustancias adictivas que pueden influir en el curso de la enfermedad. En algunas ocasiones éste consumo puede limitarse únicamente al episodio, sin cristalizar en un trastorno adictivo o sin implicar una recaída. Bajo esta premisa presentamos el siguiente caso clínico. Descripción del Caso: Paciente mujer de 52 años con diagnóstico de Trastorno Esquizafectivo tipo Bipolar ingresada en Hospital de Día de Salud Mental de Mataró por episodio maníaco en remisión parcial. Durante el ingreso se objetiva un consumo de 3 paquetes diarios de tabaco en contexto de episodio maníaco, con abstinencia previa de 6 años de evolución. Una vez resuelto el cuadro la paciente detiene el consumo de forma brusca y sin craving objetivable. Pruebas complementarias: Se realiza analítica completa con hemograma, bioquímica, perfil hepatorenal, lipídico y tiroideo, vitamina B12 y folato sin alteraciones significativas. Tratamiento: Previamente la paciente había mantenido estabilidad con Palmitato de Paliperidona 150mg/mes en monoterapia. Durante el ingreso se añade Valproato sódico hasta 1000mg (valproemia 80.28) y Lormetazepam 1mg. Discusión: Las sustancias adictivas generan cambios neurológicos que predisponen al reinicio del consumo si se expone al paciente nuevamente al tóxico a pesar de haber mantenido una abstinencia prolongada. En este caso observamos como la paciente es capaz de detener el consumo de tabaco de forma abrupta y sin craving una vez resuelto el cuadro, a pesar de haber sido una consumidora importante en el pasado. Dada la gran prevalencia del tabaquismo en pacientes con patología mental grave, podría ser relevante conocer esta posibilidad para establecer un tratamiento más o menos enfocado a prevenir una recaída.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders.

      "title": "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in adolescent males.",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa or bulimia in adolescent males occurs ten times less frequently than in adolescent females. When they occur, however, they can be clearly identified and differentiated from disorders also associated with weight loss such as swallowing phobias. Early diagnosis and treatment leads to improved outcome. While the formal psychopathology of male anorectics is similar to that of females, there is often a different motivation for the initial weight loss in males. They are more often concerned with attaining an idealized male body and avoiding teasing or criticism about their appearance. When males become ill, they tend to develop the full anorectic syndrome or not to become ill at all. Recognition of the special needs of adolescent males for individualized treatment increases the change of optimal outcome. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in the teenage male should be seen as an ineffective method of dealing with developmental crises by gaining a sense of effectiveness and control through weight reduction and food restriction. Treatment seeks to improve quickly the starvation-related aspects of the illness while attempting to find more appropriate methods of dealing with the life crises prompting the illness. The real goal of treatment is to make the anorectic or bulimic illness unnecessary by encouraging the patient to continue the work of individuation and separation so that challenges in development and problems in living are resolved in a direct rather than an indirect way through an eating disorder.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

      "title": "pileptiform Convulsive Disorder Under Chronic Meprobamate Intoxication",
      "abstract": "The present author has studied from various viewpoint 14 patients who had epileptiform convulsive disorders under choronic Meprobamate intoxication and 47 additional cases which were already reported in Japanese and other languages.1) There were no specific convulsive predi sposition and family history in the author's cases. Remarkable personality disorder of these cases were often seen in the peoples who addicted any drugs and others. They had no intellectual defect.2) Generally, convulsive seizure broke out when one took Meprobamate more than 3g daily over one to several years.3) In the literature, ev ery other author understood that these convulsive seizures had occured only as abstinence syndrom. It is certain that the majorities of these convulsions occur as abstinence syndrom but others occur during the intake of this drug. Delirium or disturbance of alertness also would develop likeweise. The present author differentiated four types regardig to the occurrence of convulsive seizure as well as the intake of this drug. A: Convulsion precipitated by abrupt withdrawal. B: Convulsion which occured during intake of this drug. C: Convulsion which occured under marked consciousness disturbance. D: Convulsion which occured particularly during the treatment of marked consiousness disturbance. Clinical types mentioned above were not always same in one patient.4) A lmost all the convulsive seizures appeared to be of epileptic nature but they often came out in the form of status epilepticus.5) Neurological signs and s ymptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, shaking and ataxia would frequently accompanied convulsions.6) Before and after convulsion, the r e was stormy consciousness disturbance which was certainly different from initial and postical twilight state. Convulsive seizures associated with fever and neurological symptoms and severe consciousness disturbance tend to have the form of status epilepticus. Therefore these signs and symtoms suggest some serious oragnic brain damage. In this regard, the present author discovered in the literatures three cases, of whom two died during status epilepticus and the other got into comatose with fever from delirium.7) EEG finding s showed convulsive readiness under Meprobamate abuse, so it is quite natural that the convulsive seizure appears even under its abuse. Moreover, some focal signs in EEG suggest localized damage.8) It was not effective to gi ve Meprobamate for the treatment of abstinence syndrome. When, once convulsion and related disorder happened to occur, such disorders would reoccur short after re-use of Meprobamate. However, if a patient does not fall in abuse again, another convulsive disorder does not occur and clinical outcome is very favourable, so that it is not necessary to prolong anticonvulsant medication. These convulsive disorders do not look over as accidental outbursts in the patient with convulsive predisposition or as rebound phenomena after long abuse of Meprobamate that has mild anticonvulsant action.",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

The first type is characterized by superficial mucous disorders with constant or increased secretory function and motility of the stomach. It has relapsing course with moderate decrease of patient's life quality. The abdominal pains and dyspepsia are observed only at periods of exacerbation. Anxiety-phobic and anxiety-depressive tendencies prevail in the mental status. The attitude to illness differs mainly by emotional-willed disorders. Insomnia is manifested by a slight delay in awakening. Focal atrophic gastritis with moderate decrease in secretory and motor functions of the stomach is typical for the second type. It develops as relapsing or monotonous suffering with insignificant decrease in patient's life quality. The pains and dyspepsia in residual state persist after exacerbation reduction. The changes in the mental status are rare. The patient's attitude to the illness is basically adequate. Slight disturbances of falling asleep prevail among sleep disorders. Diffuse atrophic gastritis with secretory failure reaching the degree of an achlorhydria and hypokinesis of stomach are observed in the third type. The course of the disease is basically monotonous with pronounced decrease in patient's life quality, with the obstinate abdominal pains and dyspepsia irrespective of the exacerbation phases of chronic gastritis. A combination of asthenic and neurotic complaints and combined sleep disorders are typical. Emotional disorders with disharmonization of personality accompanied by signs of their social and mental disadaptation are observed in the patient's mental status.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders challenge the pediatrician in several ways. The treatment course can be long, and the patient's response may be frustrating. Patients find it hard to trust professionals (as they find it hard to trust themselves) and present their situation in provocative terms (eg, \"I know what I need to eat; the only problem is that my parents are giving me a hard time.\") that ignore the cultural, familial, developmental, and physiological roots of the disorders and minimize the patient's own confusion. The impression projected by the patient that she is \"in control\" can make it hard to view her sympathetically. Being \"in control\" of an emaciated body or of chaotic eating is part of the problem. Unpleasant feelings, such as shame, blame, frustration, inadequacy, rage, and guilt, are felt routinely by patients, parents, and professionals. The risk of serious injury or death is great. The differential diagnosis includes many other serious disorders first presenting in adolescence. For all these reasons, the eating disorders are an important part of pediatric practice, and the pediatrician monitoring the patient's physical well-being and overall development is an indispensable part of the team. The eating disorders are \"model\" disorders, whose management requires understanding the physical, physiological, psychological, familial, and cultural dimensions of a teenager's life.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

      "abstract": "In asthma, paralysis does not occur after a loading dose; if it did, it might be catastrophic!Why should the same dose paralyse the patient with convulsions?Basic pharmacokinetics suggest that it should not; a bolus of, for example, 8mmol of magnesium given over 5 min, will initially distribute over the serum volume of approximately 3 1, resulting in a maximal serum concentration of 2.7 mmol.1-'.Clinically significant inhibition at the neuromuscular junction, however, requireslevels above 5 mmol.1-'[3] (in the absence of other neuromuscular blockers).Noppen et al. [2] observed a magnesium level of 19.5 mmol.1-' after the administration of approximately 12 mmol over 20 min.Magnesium deficiency is known to lower the seizure threshold and, on occasion, can cause intractable seizures [4].The proconvulsive effect of magnesium depletion is so reliable that it has become a popular technique to generate animal and tissue models of seizure activity.Various clinical conditions are associated with magnesium depletion, for example the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, where a pre-existing deficit is complicated by a further decrease in the serum level.The magnitude of this reduction correlates with the severity of symptoms [5], which include grand ma1 seizures and status epilepticus.However, even without prior depletion, magnesium appears to exert a true anticonvulsant effect.Although some animal experiments, like the pentylenetetrazole model [6] quoted by Walker et al., did not show a therapeutic effect, there were others that did and were not mentioned by Dr Walker and colleagues.Recently, Cotton et al. [7] showed a reduction of the electroencephalographic amplitude and duration of seizures in rats given magnesium intraperitoneally.This anticonvulsant effect can, in part, be explained by the physiological interaction of magnesium with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor: evidence is accumulating that the NMDA receptor contributes to epileptogenesis [%I, whilst it is well known that magnesium blocks the open channel of the NMDA receptor in a voltage dependent fashion [9].The NMDA receptor is also implicated in secondary neuronal damage after traumatic and hypoxic brain insults.Animal experiments suggest that in both conditions, magnesium may protect the brain against secondary damage mediated via the excitatory amino acids and the NMDA receptor [lo, 111.This, I suggest, could also be relevant to the neuronal loss occurring in human prolonged status epilepticus.My interpretation of the available data is that it would be worthwhile to explore magnesium's role in the treatment of status epilepticus in controlled trials, rather than to perpetuate prejudices that are not supported by evidence.",

The study of abnormal behavior among animals has traditionally centered on abnormal repetitive behaviors such as stereotypic behaviors, which are performed in consecutive repetitions (e.g., backflipping, body-rocking, or pacing) or on recurrent behaviors with longer, variable intervals of time between repetitions (e.g., excessive grooming or regurgitation and reingestion). Some abnormal behaviors can cause or aggravate health and welfare problems. Abnormal behaviors have been studied in animal models of human psychiatric disorders. Animals are more prone to engage in abnormal behaviors at certain times of day, and the specific time differs between species.",

      "abstract": "Overtraining can be defined as \"training-competition > > recovery imbalance\", that is assumed to result in glycogen deficit, catabolic > anabolic imbalance, neuroendocrine imbalance, amino acid imbalance, and autonomic imbalance. Additional non-training stress factors and monotony of training exacerbate the risk of a resulting overtraining syndrome. Short-term overtraining called overreaching which can be seen as a normal part of athletic training, must be distinguished from long-term overtraining that can lead to a state described as burnout, staleness or overtraining syndrome. Persistent performance incompetence, persistent high fatigue ratings, altered mood state, increased rate of infections, and suppressed reproductive function have been described as key findings in overtraining syndrome. An increased risk of overtraining syndrome may be expected around 3 weeks of intensified/prolonged endurance training at a high training load level. Heavy training loads may apparently be tolerated for extensive periods of time if athletes take a rest day every week and use alternating hard and easy days of training. Persistent performance incompetence and high fatigue ratings may depend on impaired or inhibited transmission of ergotropic (catabolic) signals to target organs, such as: (I) decreased neuromuscular excitability, (II) inhibition of alpha-motoneuron activity (hypothetic), (III) decreased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH (cortisol release) and increased pituitary sensitivity to GHRH (GH release) resulting in a counter-regulatory shift to a more anabolic endocrine responsibility, (IV) decreased beta-adrenoreceptor density (sensitivity to catecholamines), (V) decreased intrinsic sympathetic activity, and (VI) intracellular protective mechanisms such as increased synthesis of heat-shock proteins (HSP 70) represent a complex strategy against an overload-dependent cellular damage.",

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la alimentación son enfermedades mentales crónicas que afectan principalmente a mujeres adolescentes; la depresión, la ansiedad y los medios de comunicación conllevan a las pacientes a modificaciones del hábito alimenticio para conseguir una “figura idónea” y ser socialmente aceptadas. La clasificación según criterios del DSM-V para estos trastornos de la alimentación son anorexia nerviosa (tipo restrictiva y tipo compulsiva/purgativa) y bulimia nerviosa (subclasificada según determinantes de gravedad basados en los episodios bulímicos por semana). La incidencia de estas enfermedades es baja, tienen poco registro epidemiológico y son subdiagnosticadas. Los principales determinantes psicológicos y físicos son la extrema preocupación por la comida, el miedo a aumentar de peso, una imagen corporal distorsionada, la deshidratación y una pérdida anormal de peso, que finalmente llevan al padecimiento de diversas complicaciones orgánicas como alteraciones hidroelectrolíticas y la desnutrición. Hoy en día existen diversos instrumentos que facilitan una detección temprana de conductas de riesgo, y otros que determinan el funcionamiento familiar, la depresión y ansiedad en estas personas. Su tratamiento es interdisciplinario, basado en la psicoterapia, en un manejo médico para las complicaciones orgánicas y un tratamiento psicofarmacológico encaminado a la comorbilidad psiquiátrica teniendo en cuenta que la bulimia nerviosa ha respondido mejor a los fármacos antidepresivos, mientras que en la anorexia nerviosa no existe un tratamiento farmacológico definitivo.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the diffi culty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hypercapnia or the increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ) above normal values (4–6.5 kPa, 30–48 Torr) is often observed in patients with pulmonary disease, patients with a drug‐induced reduction of the ventilatory drive (for example, because of administration of opioid‐like drugs or anesthetics), or is artificially induced to study the ventilatory control system (for example, by increasing inspired CO 2 to study the effects of drugs on this control system). In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

      "abstract": "The cause of prolonged or recurrent symptoms following the cessation of long-term benzodiazepine use is proposed to be related to downregulation and allosteric decoupling of the γ-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex. This case series describes 2 patients with prolonged (>2 weeks) recurrent complications during attempted tapering of benzodiazepine doses after long-term treatment. Excited catatonia developed in a 90-year-old woman, and prolonged delirium developed in a 69-year-old woman. Both patients showed improvement of symptoms after resumption of higher doses of benzodiazepine treatment and recurrence of symptoms when the dose was again lowered. Caution should be exercised regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines in older adults (aged ≥65 years). Tapering of benzodiazepines in older patients after long-term treatment may require slow decreases in dose over long periods. Psychotherapeutic interventions, such as brief cognitive therapy with psychoeducation and motivational enhancement, and osteopathic manipulative treatment to decrease paravertebral muscle tension may be beneficial during the tapering process.",

      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

      "title": "Massive Ingestion of Foreign Bodies by Patients with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Ingestion of foreign bodies has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, sometimes leading to severe complications. This report is of a patient with schizophrenia, who ingested a variety of non-edible substances as a manifestation of the illness and developed acute intestinal obstruction. The number of articles, their shape and size were unusual. The psychopathology that led the patient to indulge in this behaviour is discussed. Key words: Foreign bodies, Pain threshold, Pica, Schizophrenia Introduction Ingestion of foreign bodies has been reported in several patients with schizophrenia. (1) This behaviour can lead to severe complications. (2) There has been a report of death due to aspiration after a woman with schizophrenia swallowed a large number of foreign bodies. (3) The occurrence of pica, or craving for non-edible items, is a common occurrence in individuals with mental handicap and also occurs as a manifestation of severe psychopathology. (1-3) This paper reports a patient with schizophrenia who, as a manifestation of the illness, ingested a variety of non-edible substances and developed acute intestinal obstruction. The number of articles, their shape, and size were varied. Case History A 25-year-old unmarried unemployed man first consulted the Central Institute of Psychiatry in Ranchi, India, in 1989 and was clinically supervised at the Institute for the next 7 years. He had normal developmental milestones, was a graduate, was premorbidly well-adjusted, and did not have any history of substance abuse. He did not have any evidence of brain damage or any major medical illness. There was no family history of mental illness. During the 7 years of supervision, he was variously treated as an outpatient and an inpatient. Due to exacerbation of symptoms he was admitted to the Institute on 4 occasions and the course of his illness showed a fluctuating clinical picture. Follow up and compliance with the prescribed medications was poor. During the initial phase, he had prominent negative features, occasional violent outbursts, and a well-systematised delusion of persecution against his neighbours. Throughout the period of supervision, it was difficult to establish a rapport with him. All the admissions were due to psychotic exacerbations, which initially manifested as violent behaviour, delusions of persecution, delusion of reference, and bizarre delusions--delusions of grandeur became one of the prominent features. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. During the initial period, he was seen to be fearful and was having delusions of persecution against all his neighbours and the local ruling party. However, he gradually became defiant and claimed he was powerful and capable of bringing doom to all humanity. At times he claimed that he was 'Ravana' (the king of demons according to the Hindu epic Ramayana). He abused tobacco in a large quantity and experienced a gross deterioration in personal care. The treatment schedule included chlorpromazine 500 mg and trihexiphenidyl 2 mg for the initial 2 years. This regimen was changed to trifluoperazine 15 mg for 1 year and ultimately to fluphenazine-decanoate 25 mg intramuscularly every 21 days for the next 3 to 4 years. For a period of 1 year he was additionally prescribed 900 mg of lithium carbonate with a serum lithium concentration between 0.6-0.96 meq/l. During the hospital admissions he made a steady recovery but his follow up and compliance was poor. During his fourth and last admission in 1996, the major complaint was that he was eating dead insects, dead lizards, dead snakes, a dead frog, and animal bones. He also had florid delusions of grandiosity during this period and claimed that he had acquired all the power from the divine sources. However, he remained guarded about the reasons for his abnormal eating behaviour. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] One month after he was discharged from hospital, he complained of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. …",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter details the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder module in the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5, Child and Parent Version: Child Interview Schedule (CIS). In assessing for the clinical significance of obsessions, persistence is first assessed, followed by distress and resistance. The interviewer should list and rate each obsession identified by the child using the Feelings Thermometer. Meanwhile, in assessing for compulsions, the frequency of the repetitive behavior is rated. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, which are repetitive and difficult to control, and/or compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day). In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. Recognition by the child that the symptoms are excessive or unreasonable is not necessary to make the diagnosis in children.",

      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) typically begins during adolescence, and primarily affects young women, with a lifetime prevalence of 1–2.5% among women in the general population [1–3]. The salient behavioral disturbances of BN are binge-eating episodes associated with a sense of loss of control, followed by inappropriate behaviors to avoid weight gain [4]. The nature of these core disturbances implies the presence of difficulties with self-regulatory control, which is consistent with the tendency of individuals with BN to engage in other impulsive behaviors, such as substance abuse and selfinjurious behaviors [5–10]. In addition, studies of temperament have documented elevated measures of impulsivity in this population [11], and empirical findings indicate that impulsiv ity is c orrelated with the severity of bulimic symptoms [5,12,13]. Thus, persons with BN seem to have an impaired capacity to engage self - regulatory control.",

      "abstract": "1. Sixty-two patients were studied in whom organic disease of the central nervous system was probably induced, at least in part, by metabolic deficiency. Mental symptoms were present in 25 of these cases. 2. The deficiency is termed a \"neurometabolic crisis.\" It may be caused by absolute or relative avitaminosis, by starvation of various origins or by endocrine factors. 3. Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

By phase III patients are forced by the severity of starvation symptoms to admit that they are ill.

      "abstract": "Obesity is frequently acquainting as an abnormal accumulation of body fat to the degree that may cause serious health consequences. ( Yanovski et al. , 2014). One of the most common complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a widespread complaint that is closely associated with global obesity epidemics, and it is described as frequent complete or partial flop of the upper airway during sleep leading to gaseous exchange impairment and disturbance of sleep. It is the commonest category of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the world as reported in different epidemiological studies. (McNicholas et al ., 2007). Central sleep apnea : is described  as decreased respiratory effort leading to decrease or absence of ventilation .While in mixed apnea it is categorized by starting centrally and ending with obstructive events.In obstructive sleep apnea: the effort of  respiration is preserved but ventilation decrement  or absence due to partial or total obstruction in the upper airway; apnea is well-defined as the total airflow cessation lasting 10 sec. or more , There are three types of apneas :obstructive, central and mixed . A hypopnea: is defined as a reduction in airflow (30-50%) that is followed by an arousal from sleep or a decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (3-4%)( The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999 and Kushida et al .,2005). The severity of sleep apnea is evaluated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. According to the American Academy of sleep Medicine recommendations , OSA is defined with AHI>5., and it is classified as mild OSA with AHI of 5 to 15;moderate OSA with AHI of 16 to 30;and severe OSA with AHI > 30.(The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999). The Apnea–Hypopnea Index or Apnoea–Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to determine sleep apnea severity. It is characterized by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation measurement gives a complete sleep apnea severity score that assesses the number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation.               (Ruehland et al .,2009 ). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are categorized as Normal: 0-4;Mild Sleep Apnea: 5-14;Moderate Sleep Apnea: 15-29; Severe Sleep Apnea: 30 or more.(Ruehland et al ., 2009 ).",

      "title": "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants",
      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

Man would deteriorate after a time at these heights even under the best con­ditions: if he is doing hard work and is subjected to many strains, mental and physical, other factors are brought to bear which will aggravate this basic state. Such factors are illness, exhaustion, starvation and dehydration. Symptoms similar to those of deterioration, but more acute in onset, appear if man goes too quickly to high altitudes without first acclimatizing. These symptoms of acute mountain sickness disappear if the subject returns to lower levels for some time. If he goes to moderate heights when acclimatizing he will be able to stay for reasonably long periods without undue trouble. Exhaustion at high altitudes is often only cured by coming down to lower levels, as above a certain height there seems to be little or no recovery.",

      "abstract": "Gastric function is finely modulated by a series of neurological mechanisms, so that gastric digestion is normally not perceived. Alteration of these control mechanisms may lead to different situations, which are frequently associated with symptoms. An impaired tonic contraction of the proximal stomach, that is, an impaired gastric tone, results in gastroparesis. Patients with functional dyspepsia, and also patients with achalasia, have impaired meal accommodation of the stomach. Interestingly, patients with functional dyspepsia may also have a sensory dysfunction, and both dysfunctions could play a synergistic role. However, the sensory dysfunction in dyspepsia, particularly the types of afferent fibres affected, and the mechanisms of impaired accommodation, still remain to be characterized. Evaluation of gastric function has been approached using the barostat. However, the barostat has limitations and potential technical pitfalls that require proper attention. Meal ingestion induces a variety of reflexes and the net result is a relaxation of the stomach. However, gastric reflexes can be best evaluated with the stomach empty, when the stimuli are applied at a different site. Nevertheless, altered reflex responses may be difficult to interpret. For instance, absent or decreased relaxatory responses may equally correspond to a gastroparetic stomach without tone or to a dyspeptic stomach unable to relax. In this context, it may be important to measure basal tone. Distension of the stomach by means of the barostat has been also used to test gastric sensitivity. However, recent studies have shown that perception of gastric distension relays on stimulation of tension receptors; since wall tension depends on both pressure and volume, distension with the barostat may be difficult to standardize. Hopefully, a battery of tests may become available in the near future for a complete neuromuscular evaluation of the gut.",

Chronic constipation may accompany or be a symptom of some general organic or functional morbid process, or it may exist as an independent affection. Inability of the bowel to empty itself depends of course on a disturbance of some part of the mechanism involved in defecation. The essential physiology of the impulse to defecation and the factors on which it depends are but imperfectly understood.

For established status epilepticus, midazolam, lorazepam, phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam are effective agents in controlling seizures, but evidence base lacks the required degree of precision. There is a need to conduct more research on other drugs routinely used for this condition.",

      "title": "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: Role of a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit in a General Children's Hospital",
      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by repeated, unpredictable, explosive, and unexplained bouts of vomiting. The syndrome is episodic, and patients are free of nausea and vomiting between episodes. During episodes, vomiting and retching are intense, especially in the early stage. Approximately 85% of episodes are of fairly uniform length, and they range in frequency from 1 to 70 per year, averaging 12 per year. They recur fairly regularly in approximately half the patients but are sporadic in others. Pfau et al. (1) differentiated two subcategories of CVS in their large sample of patients: cyclical, with vomiting of high peak intensity but low frequency (2 episodes per month), and chronic (36 episodes per month). The emotional and physical distress of the episodes may also cause marked disturbances in behavior: some patients lie in bed immobile, completely withdrawn and uncommunicative, whereas others overwhelm caregivers with demanding and clinging behavior. Although most patients are treated by pediatric gastroenterologists, the gastrointestinal aspect of CVS does not encompass the array of potential causes, which may involve the metabolic, endocrinologic, neurologic, and psychophysiologic systems (2), and gastroenterologists do not always provide satisfactory answers to the treatment of this disorder. In 1992, the CVS Association defined several diagnostic criteria for CVS: 1) Essential symptoms: recurrent bouts of vomiting; symptom-free intervals; duration of episodes, from hours to days; no identifiable cause; 2) supportive symptoms: stereotypic pattern; similarity of episodes in timing, intensity, duration, and associated symptoms; self-limiting; and 3) associated symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, motion sickness, low-grade fever, pallor, diarrhea, dehydration, salivation, and social isolation. The diagnosis is usually made after an extensive medical work-up to exclude organic or psychiatric disorders, and there is often a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the establishment of a final treatment plan. This delay exacts a toll on patient and family in emotional stress and causes an arrest in psychosocial and academic development. Furthermore, the experience with prophylactic therapy for cyclic vomiting has been disappointing. Antidepressants were not considered useful in some of the studies (3-5), whereas in others the results are encouraging (6). Prophylaxis is less likely to be beneficial in the more severe cases of CVS, although it is effective in patients whose episodes are precipitated by infection (7) or who have features consistent with migraine (8). Propranolol (5), barbiturates (9), or serotonin receptor antagonists (10) have been suggested as potential prophylactic agents in children with severe or frequent symptoms. Owing to the complexity of the syndrome, we believe it may best be treated with a combined behavioral-cognitive supportive approach. The purpose of the pressure study was to describe integrated management of CVS in a psychiatric unit in a general children's hospital. A representative case report is presented. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old girl had been having episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain since she was 5 years of age. According to her mother, she had been a normal and friendly child until then. The pregnancy was planned, and its course was uneventful. The first episode occurred just before and child's fifth birthday party and lasted several days. Recurrences were noted approximately every 2 months, usually triggered by anxiety-provoking situations. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years, the patients made countless visits to the emergency room with symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain and was a candidate for surgery several times, owing to high amylase levels. She was admitted to the hospital 12 times in the best pediatric units in Israel, where she underwent elaborate work-ups. No organic cause was found, and no treatment was effective in either preventing or aborting the episodes. As a consequence, her grades declined, and she remained very immature and dependent. Her mother reported that at the age of 10, her daughter engaged mainly in games with dolls. All family activities revolved around her illness. The girl became attached to her mother, who was involved in all the diagnostic dilemmas and procedures, and gradually became estranged from her father and older brothers and sister, who eventually rejected her. During the 6 months before the present admission, the episodes had become more frequent and severe. The patient stopped attending school and had begun sleeping in the room with her mother. The patient appeared at our center in a wheelchair and clung to her mother constantly. She looked younger than her age and was very thin, with signs of dehydration. During the first interviews, she was hostile and negativistic. She continually salivated, spit on the floor, and vomited every 15 to 20 minutes. She did not comply with the unit's regulations: She did not eat at the regular hours, used the phone without permission, and refused to participate in the regular group activities. She evoked feelings of rejection and disgust from the other patients and most of the unit's team. The staff believed they were helpless to deal with the bouts of vomiting, and some criticized the decision to admit her to the unit. However, the pediatricians who had referred her after an intensive diagnostic work-up were convinced that the vomiting had a psychological basis. The family, especially the mother, was hostile and continued to pursue a medical cause. They believed that the pediatricians had \"dumped them\" onto psychiatry. The first week of the patient's hospital stay was used for careful observation of the her behavior before and during the episodes. She was asked to describe the thoughts and images that seemed to intensify or diminish the episodes. We also studied the mother's response to the child before, during, and after the episodes. The tentative diagnosis after 1 week was CVS. This diagnosis had been suggested many times in the past but was never identified with certainty. A treatment plan was formulated, designed specifically to reduce the frequency and duration of the episodes and the severity of the symptoms, prevent complications such as esophagitis and electrolyte disturbances, reintegrate the child academically and socially, and reorganize family life. We provided the family clear information about the syndrome and the treatment plan and explained to the mother why she had to separate herself from the child. We also gave staff members precise instructions on the approach to imminent episodes and to isolated episodes or bouts of vomiting. The treatment protocol for CVS episodes was as follows: First Episode identification of prodromal symptoms: tension, dizziness, general malaise or \"a strange feeling\"; cessation of oral feeding; institution of pharmacologic intervention: 10 mg oxazepam and/or 50 mg promethazine; sensory isolation, with the patient lying prone in a dark and quiet room; and application of guided imagery, in which the child, in a relaxed state, was asked to imagine herself in places and situations in which she felt or would have felt tranquil and happy. In guided imagery, a staff member sits by the patient's bed and accompanies the imagery with related suggestions voiced in a monotonous tone. The child is also asked what helps induced relaxation (e.g., listening to music; patting a doll) and is encouraged to use these measures. First Recurrence Oral feedings were ceased and administration of intravenous fluids and 8 mg intravenous ondansetron per 50 ml fluid was infused for 20 to 30 minutes, with isolation of the patients and application of guided imagery and hypnotic suggestion. Second Recurrence Ondansetron (4 mg) was administered for 20 to 30 minutes, accompanied by sensory isolation, guided imagery, and hypnotic suggestion. If all these measures failed, the staff administered intravenous benzodiazepines to induce sleep and stop the cycle. All steps were complemented by family education and guidance (avoiding criticism, praising the family for any successful change they induce, encouraging them to work as a team and to be tolerant of one another). The process of gaining the family's trust and cooperation was gradual. It was clear from the beginning that without the father's taking part in the treatment plan, nothing would be achieved and that he would sabotage any success. The father tended to ignore the child, smoked cigarettes while she was vomiting and crying, and criticized the mother when she tried to help her. We therefore worked to reduce the father's hostility and anger and to enroll him as part of the \"family team.\" He was encouraged to serve as a role model for the other children regarding the acceptance and tolerance of the patient's illness. We eventually succeeded once the patient's clinical condition began to improve. The vomiting episodes gradually lessened in frequency and intensity. Before discharge, we met several times with the mother and the community mobile team that was expected to take over the patient's care. Telephone assistance was made available at all times. The mother surprised us by enthusiastically adopting our model and continuing to apply it at home. She learned to identify the prodromal symptoms, help the child stay calm and relaxed, and transfer the message of control and safety. Follow-up The child continued under observation for 18 months after discharge. She began to attend school regularly, gained weight, and matured emotionally and physically. She has experienced mainly prodromal symptoms with which she and her mother cope successfully, with the help of the community team, thus aborting imminent episodes of vomiting. DISCUSSION This case is representative of the integrated approach used in our psychiatric unit to manage CVS. The patient's long history of many hospital admissions and work-ups created much frustration, anger, and hostility in the medical caregivers and the family. Almost 7 years passed from the first vomiting bout to the formation of a coherent treatment plan. Unfortunately, this course is typical in many cases of CVS (3). The long delay to referral to a psychiatric unit is attributable mainly to the complexity of the disorder and the extensive differential diagnosis. Vomiting is a nonspecific symptom, and cyclic vomiting is a symptom complex that may result from a disorder of any major organ system (11). The role of stress factors in CVS is well recognized, and the emotional aspects have to be addressed (12,13). In one study, approximately 77% of patients with CVS in a large series were able to identify specific circumstances or conditions that precipitated the episodes (3). Gonzalez-Heydrich et al. (14) stressed the potential harm of assuming that recurrent episodes of vomiting, even in the presence of overt psychopathology, are psychiatric in origin. The long-term goals of therapy are to decrease the number and severity of the bouts of vomiting and to help the patients to live with the disability. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is traumatic to the entire family, who feel like helpless victims of the vomiting cycles. Family life tends to center around the needs of the sick child to the point of the family's incapacitation. The parents may also be aware of the bodily harm the repeated vomiting causes the child and fear the child's imminent death. These feelings are often accompanied by anger at the medical community for its failure to identify or cure the disease. In our case, the CVS led to a symbiotic relationship between mother and child and the detachment of the remaining family members from them. This type of situation, with its secondary gains, may evolve into an irreversible chronic state. The family is therefore an essential part of the treatment plan. Our success in treating the disorder in the patient presented here was attributable to the following elements: separation of the child from the mother as a first step; provision of a safe environment for the child in an inpatient unit; formulation of a coherent behavioral-cognitive treatment plan; treatment of the overt behavior with behavioral, medical, and pharmacologic measures; receipt of support from the pediatric department; institution of supportive and education sessions to change the family's attitude; adoption of the model by the family; and assuring continuity of care in the community before discharge. Owing to the combination of complicated medical work-up, the lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder, the interplay between biologic and emotional factors in initiating and maintaining the disorder, the emotional burden on the family and the patient, and the crippling sequelae, careful observation and the formulation of a treatment plan by a specialized psychosomatic unit are needed in the early stage of the disease. A regular pediatric department, even one in which a psychiatric consultant is available, is not sufficiently organized to treat such a complicated disorder. We believe that these patients require hospital admission in a unit similar to ours, in which behavioral-cognitive, psychosocial-environmental, psychodynamic, family, pharmacologic, and medical intervention are integrated in a therapeutic milieu. That the unit is part of a medical complex reassures the family that the child is in safe hands.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Neurogenic bowel dysfunction remains a major life-limiting problem and has also long been known as an area of poor self-care after spinal cord injury. Impairments in sensation of need for defecation, of volitional control, and the potential for constipation and fecal incontinence cause distress, impact social function, and present management challenges. Management goals include optimal social function, especially minimizing incontinence and interference with living activities, and prevention of complications such as abdominal pain, impaction, bowel obstruction, and hemorrhoids. Gastrointestinal problems in both the acute and the chronic phases of spinal cord injury are a major cause of gastrointestinal morbidity. The control of the gastrointestinal system involves complex interactions between autonomic and somatic innervation that ultimately act at the level of the intrinsic enteric nervous system. Patients with spinal cord injuries need a bowel program that allows socially acceptable continence and prevents fecal impaction. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction in spinal cord injuries refers to the colonic dysfunction that occurs as reduced colonic transit, constipation, disordered evacuation reflexes, and potential incontinence following disruption of normal control. In addition to defecation problems due to neurogenic bowel dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems associated with the upper gastrointestinal tract include dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcer and gastritis, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, gallbladder disease, and pancreatitis. Nutritional homeostasis after major injuries is often associated with more favorable results by the timing and route of nutritional supplementation.",

Therefore, the development and testing of drugs for epilepsy poses problems peculiar to the condition. Existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are recognised to have effects on the central nervous system beyond seizure control. Awareness is growing, in particular, about effects on cognition and behavior. To achieve acceptance as a drug for chronic therapy, it is desirable for a new compound to have a sufficiently long elimination half-life (t12,el) such that once- or twice-daily dosing is all that is required; a half-life in the range of 15–30h is ideal. The chronic administration of AEDs capable of inducing liver enzymes may affect the new compound in one of two ways. Drugs with a high first-pass metabolism may have a reduced bioavailability.",

      "title": "The body asks and the mind judges: the episode of food craving, its triggers and nutritional treatment",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Food desires are defined as motivations that drive the search for and consumption of food. However, when domains of intensity and urgency are activated, these desires can become intense (i.e. food craving), being then characterized by episodes or cognitive events loaded with affectivity, in which food is associated with obtaining pleasure or relief, which is the only attentional focus. Specificity and urgency mark the differentiation between food desires and cravings. The process of elaboration with vivid images, the retention in working memory, the emergence of a negative affect state (awareness of the lack), and a committed attentional focus to seek food are characterized as stages of an episode of food craving. Individuals with eating disorders have the lowest levels of food craving when it comes to anorexia nervosa and the subsequent increase to bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Some environmental and cultural triggers and internal factors of cognition and emotions play a crucial role in the emergence of food craving episodes. The external factors include positive/negative events, food environment, advertisements, cultural beliefs about food, specific locations, and food itself. The internal factors comprise dietary restriction, food reward, impulsivity/inflexibility, emotions, thoughts and feelings about food, hunger/satiety/appetite, and anxious/depressive symptoms. Treatment involves the association of flexibility, awareness, and questioning strategies about dietary practices based on three principles: unconditional permission to eat, eating more for physical than emotional reasons, and tuning in with the body’s signs of hunger and satiety (intuitive eating).",

That condition is characterized as ‘vegetative’ on the basis of the behaviour of patients, not of their underlying neurological disorder or disorders (Jennett 1993: 40). This behaviour includes the following features: The patient has periods of wakefulness and sleep, in contrast to patients in coma who are in a sleep–like condition. During the periods of wakefulness the patient exhibits reflex actions and can swallow small amounts of food and water by mouth, but does not exhibit voluntary action or psychologically meaningful interaction with the environment. Patients in a vegetative state breathe spontaneously (Institute of Medical Ethics Working Party 1991: 96–97).",

Case description A 91-year-old vulnerable man developed severe delirium with agitation, verbal and physical aggression and visual hallucinations 3 days after starting treatment with low-dose prednisone. The delirium disappeared completely after prednisone was stopped. The delirium led to a long hospital stay of 36 days, weight loss of 10 kg due to undernourishment and extension of home care on discharge. Conclusion This case illustrates that delirium is always lurking around the corner in patients with multiple vulnerabilities. The provoking factor can be slight, for example 15 or 5 mg of prednisone. So be careful when starting prednisone in vulnerable elderly patients.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff.Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria).Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis.Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

      "title": "Pediatric Phagophobia: A Systematic Review and a Case Report of Pharmacological Interventions",
      "abstract": "Background: Phagophobia is characterized by conditioned excessive fear of swallowing or choking that is usually triggered by an incident. It usually leads to avoidance of certain types of food or, in severe forms, a complete refusal to eat solid food and/or liquids. The condition is commonly associated with physical and psychological symptoms impacting the health condition of the individual due to deprivation of essential nutrients. Case Presentation: A 12-year-old boy developed acute onset fear of swallowing (Phagophobia) following a dream he had of someone choking. This was exacerbated by watching an online video of a person choking. This has led to an avoidance of solid food and dependence on soft food and liquids. Fear of swallowing along with food avoidance has led to malnutrition, weight loss, and several physical complaints for which the patient was admitted under pediatric care. A course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) resulted in limited response and was augmented with fluoxetine. Full remission was achieved within six weeks. Methods: A systematic review of all peer-reviewed English literature was performed for articles related to the pharmacological treatment of pediatric phagophobia (0-18 years) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 17 case reports were identified describing 17 children with phagophobia (females = 70 %). The mean age was 9.3 and the average was between 2 and 15 years who were diagnosed with choking phobia/ phagophobia or different but equivalent diagnoses like Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder or Post Traumatic Feeding Disorder. Different classes of medications were used in variable doses for different durations which were associated with significant improvement in eating patterns and reduction in fear and anxiety associated with eating. Conclusion: Phagophobia is a serious and potentially life-threatening illness that can cause physical complications and functional impairment in the psychosocial aspect. Pharmacological treatment can be a beneficial and safe option either alone or in combination with therapeutic interventions for children presenting with phagophobia.",

Terms such as hyperacute or fulminant hepatic necrosis have been used to emphasize the rapidity and severity of the condition. The onset of acute liver failure is heralded by an altered mental state, often with agitation and confusion that may proceed to coma, and by evidence of coagulopathy [1–4]. The diagnosis of acute liver failure requires that these symptoms develop in a patient without preexisting chronic liver disease. Although not all observers agree on precise definitions, it is generally accepted that onset of liver-related illness (usually, but not always, accompanied by jaundice) less than 8 weeks before patient presentation with altered mentation and coagulopathy fits the designation of acute liver failure. Development of these signs within a week of onset of liver disease and as much as 6 months from the first sign of illness is sometimes referred to as hyperacute and subacute liver failure, respectively.",

Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object.

Actigraphic recordings for 2 weeks disclosed persistent muscular activity during the nocturnal period and two to five episodes per night of further enhanced muscular activity that corresponded to the eating episodes noted by the patient in his diary. The sleep medicine specialist established a diagnosis of sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) based on the clinical history and on the results of the video-polysomnography (PSG) recording. Low-dosage dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/carbidopa at bedtime, sometimes combined with codeine and/or clonazepam, bromocriptine and pramipexole, have been shown to reduce the eating episodes.",

Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

      "abstract": "The definition of stress varies from author to author. Whether or not it is experienced depends on the perception of the potentially stress-producing event. Stress can be induced experimentally in animals or human beings in various ways and can arise from a person's occupation, leading to adverse effects such as hypertension, cardiac alterations, increase in gastric acid secretion and the occurrence of peptic ulceration. In man, peptic ulceration may be linked to a dependence-independence conflict. The incidence of duodenal ulcer has been shown to be higher in those from broken homes than from normal homes. In 103 duodenal ulcer patients with high scores for stressful life events followed-up over a 15 month period, the outcome was more favourable in those who received psychotherapy plus intermittent pharmacotherapy than in those who received intermittent pharmacotherapy alone.",

      "title": "Your Loved One Has Migraines",
      "abstract": "There are few things more distressing than seeing your loved one in pain. Migraine, which causes repeated attacks of severe head pain associated with other disabling symptoms, affects not only the person who has it but also impacts the people close to them. It is not just a headache. Migraine produces episodes of moderate to severe head pain that is often throbbing, and generally accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise, nausea and/or vomiting, and is worsened with movement or routine activity. There may be other symptoms, such as sensitivity to odors, inability to concentrate, trouble producing speech, numbness, balance problems, weakness, double vision, and dizziness. About 25% of patients with migraine experience an aura of visual symptoms or other neurologic symptoms, usually occurring prior to their headache pain. The headaches usually last several hours and sometimes persist for days. Some patients identify triggers, such as food triggers, alcohol, food additives, certain odors, and artificial sweeteners. Patients with migraine have a genetic predisposition to having migraines, and most have a family history of migraine. The migraine brain is “sensitive” and reacts to things that do not generally bother people who do not have migraine. The migraine brain also hates change. Thus, stress or let-down from stress, change in sleep pattern (too much, too little, changing sleep onset or awakening time), heat, bright lights, loud noises, missing meals, and dehydration may provoke migraines as well. Migraines often occur with menstrual periods in women and worsen around menopause when hormones are fluctuating. Weather changes are often blamed but the scientific data supporting this are inconsistent. The most common reason that migraines worsen over time is overuse of symptomatic medications, which is called medication overuse headache. Over-the-counter as well as prescription medications can produce this condition, which turns episodic migraine into headaches that become more frequent and ultimately become daily. Even seemingly “safe” medications such as acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory medications and caffeine-containing compounds can cause worsening of migraines over time. It is important to limit symptomatic medication use (all medications combined if there is more than one medication used) to twice weekly. If someone requires symptomatic more often than twice a week, their preventive medication is not optimized. Stressful life events and chronic internalized stress are other common causes of worsening migraine. The medical profession used to talk about a “migraine personality” occurring in type A, driven, controlling, detail-oriented people. This is not true; anyone can have migraine. As migraine is episodic, often severe, and interferes with activities, many people with migraine have anxiety related to the fear of future migraines. Having frequent pain and feeling like a burden to one's family also leads to depression. Sometimes the loved ones wonder if patients with migraine are using their headaches to be manipulative missing school, not attending events, requiring help for daily tasks. This is generally not the case but some people with frequent headaches (particularly those overusing symptomatic medications) develop pain behaviors and assume a “sick role.” Well-meaning relatives and friends may sometimes worsen this, catering to all the needs of their loved one and focusing the majority of interactions on their pain. This is draining on loved ones as well as patients and may create a downward spiral of deteriorating relationships and social withdrawal. Patients with migraine do not require 24 hour care or observation (even in the hospital). It is important for people with severe migraines to keep living life, getting out of bed and doing something every day, and emphasizing what they CAN do, rather than what they CANNOT do every day. Exercise helps, and need not be vigorous walking, light yoga, tai chi, pilates, and water exercise are all good options. Patients are encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests, even if they don't feel well. Children should go to school. Cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback are helpful. Anxiety is best addressed by these methods combined with counseling, as opposed to medications. Counseling and antidepressants are helpful to treat depression; while patients with depression are more likely to have migraine and vice versa, improvement of pain often helps mood. Each patient needs to take charge of their own care, including managing (and knowing) their own medications, speaking for themselves at office visits, sending and responding to their own medical office communications, and contacting the office themselves (unless the circumstances are dire). That said, others may want to be on the lookout for medication overuse, hiding or hoarding medications. Migraine is inherently a treatable problem. Successful treatment of frequent migraines requires more than pills and procedures, although they help substantially. Other aspects of care include physical therapy, exercise, counseling and mental health care, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle and happy living. Realistic expectations are important: we are aiming for a reduction in migraine frequency, with infrequent migraines that are effectively treated with symptomatic medications when they occur.",

This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

Patients do not always present with obsessions or compulsions and this may complicate the process of diagnosing and starting adequate treatment. In this article three patients suffering from OCD but not presenting with obsessions or compulsions are discussed. In the first case, in a 42-year-old woman, the presenting symptom is a therapy-resistant dermatitis, due to excessive washing. The second patient, a 27-year-old man, presented with a depression, a frequent comorbid condition. In the third case, a 34-year-old man, the effects on and the suffering of the partner and family of a patient with OCD (they were asked to co-operate in his compulsive behaviour) were the reason for his wife to consult the general practitioner. OCD has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.5% and is somewhat more frequent in females than in males. The most characteristic symptoms are obsessions and/or compulsions. They cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), and interfere significantly with the person's functioning (occupational, social activities, relationships). Neurobiological studies suggest genetic influences and dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the brain. The treatment of OCD consists of pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy, but it is a lifelong condition.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mental health problems, specifically mental disorders, develop from a complex system and not from a single cause. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects more than 2% of the population and generally the course of the illness is insidious and chronic. When functioning adequately, family constitutes a very important resource to face health problems and to help to improve the patient’s life quality. This is the reason why it is important to underline the relevance of a stable, good functioning of the family system aimed at attaining an optimal development of all its members. Such development may be hindered by the family’s incapability to modify functioning patterns at crucial moments when they are trapped in a series of inadaptable interactions which prevent to give specific solutions to the problems that are appearing, and when reporting, within a context of expressed emotion, an emotional over-involvement and high levels of hostility and criticism towards the member with OCD. Family accommodation is a phenomenon typical of families where the identified patient exerts a control based on aggressiveness when his/her wishes are not rewarded within the group. There are very few researches on the functioning of families of patients diagnosed with obsessivecompulsive disorder. Generally, these researches are related with the partially negative effects that the interactions have on the behavior of patients and their relatives by preventing or hindering the development of the subject’s system. The accordance between the patient’s emotional regulation or emotional intelligence and their relatives has not been studied. On the other hand, the knowledge of the beliefs that relatives hold regarding the illness may be related with the functioning of the group as a family, whereas beliefs will provide consistency to family life because they provide continuity between past, present and future. They are also a way to address new and ambiguous situations such as mental illness. This is the reason why getting to know these family systems may allow elaborating more specific and effective intervention programs for groups and families.",

Tal es el caso de la aparicion de periodos de somnolencia durante las jornadas laborales, lo cual se ha convertido en una causa importante de accidentes automovilisticos, industriales y medicos. La somnolencia es causada por el ritmo circadiano y la privacion del sueno, es un estado fisiologico donde el tiempo de respuesta es mas lento que los niveles normales, los principales sintomas de somnolencia son la falta de capacidad de concentracion, atencion, vigilancia y dificultades para mantenerse despierto (Abbood, et al., 2014). En esta tesis se presenta el desarrollo de un sistema de asistencia no intrusivo para la deteccion de somnolencia en tiempo real, que alerta al usuario si es necesario, con el objetivo de reducir el numero de accidentes causados por somnolencia. El dispositivo desarrollado esta basado en el monitoreo de ritmo cardiaco debido a que el sistema nervioso autonomo afecta el latido del corazon de una persona con somnolencia (Bader, 2002). En este proyecto se realizaron estudios aplicando la metodologia seis sigma para el desarrollo de productos, basandose en una muestra de 20 usuarios, monitoreando su ritmo cardiaco a lo largo de sus actividades diarias para determinar sus rangos de vigilia y sueno, posteriormente se realizaron pruebas con un simulador de manejo activando un sistema de asistencia cuando su estado de alerta disminuia drasticamente. Como sistema de asistencia se incorporo una alarma sonora para recuperar el estado de alerta del usuario, debido a los efectos del sonido en las primeras etapas del sueno. Se identificaron variaciones importantes en el ritmo cardiaco que pueden ser utilizadas para la estandarizacion del monitoreo de somnolencia, manteniendo la medicion del estado de alerta, sin importar los rangos de ritmo cardiaco de cada persona.",

      "title": "<i>Psychotherapy-Lite:</i> Obesity and the Role of the Mental Health Practitioner",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic medical disorder that is the result of a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, neuro-endocrinological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. There are treatment algorithms, depending on the severity of obesity, and a multi-component approach, including attention to psychological issues, is recommended regardless of the level of obesity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is beneficial in assisting with stimulus control, self-monitoring of lifestyle changes, goal-setting, and restructuring negative and self-defeating thoughts, and psychodynamic (insight-oriented) psychotherapy is useful in assisting with conflicts regarding excessive weight, body image, relationship to food and disordered patterns of eating, and dealing with the prejudice and overt discrimination obese patients may experience. Neither therapy is particularly effective alone and either and/or both may need to be continued indefinitely to avoid inevitable weight regain. Psychological intervention before and during the difficult process of dieting, as well as before and after bariatric surgery, is essential for some vulnerable patients. Since psychological factors are neither primarily etiological nor even necessarily predominant in obesity, the mental health professional plays an important, though adjunctive--\"psychotherapy-lite\" role--in treating obese patients.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with OCD often engage in behaviors that help them avoid or escape anxious or distressing feelings. These behaviors can include typical compulsions seen in OCD, such as handwashing and checking, as well as maladaptive behaviors like substance use or problematic eating. These eating patterns can be a form of experiential avoidance, or the attempt to change or avoid negative thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations, even if it causes harm. Individuals with OCD have low distress tolerance (DT) or a limited capacity for enduring negative emotional experiences and a tendency to become overly reactive to stress and distress. Low DT is associated with a range of dysregulated behaviors and psychological disorders. DT relates to other affect intolerance and sensitivities, including emotional dysregulation, intolerance to uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency, and experiential avoidance. Studies have revealed that those with OCD tend to have more abnormal eating habits. which can be a way to escape or regulate emotions, avoid negative feelings, and, as a result, sustain maintenance variables in the OCD cycle.",

ED could be operationalized as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exercise, leading to clinically impairment or distress. Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

Experimental binges provide a valid model for examining aspects of the gradual progression from drug use to abuse, particularly when attempting to identify environmental and genetic factors that may prompt intermittent behavioral routines to become dysregulated, as exemplified during cycles of bingeing. Here we explore binge behavior in animals with a particular focus on data obtained from self-administration studies that utilize conditions that allow for both unrestricted and prolonged access to cocaine, opiates, alcohol or food. Many behavioral and neural effects of bingeing are shared between these substances, indicating that the repetitive nature of binge behavior for many types of drug abuse may be related to the dysregulation of common neural circuits. Interestingly, intense bingeing occurs with the emergence of two potential changes in behavior; an increase in the rate or an increase in the persistence of behavioral responding. These two changes indicate that control over bingeing may be determined by a number of processes, including sensitization, tolerance, and withdrawal.",

The lifetime prevalence of purging disorder is comparable to both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, placing it as a significant eating disorder phenotype. Purging disorder is symptomatologically similar to bulimia nervosa, except for the absence of binge eating episodes. However, despite the common features with other eating disorders, purging disorder appears as a clinically significant and potentially distinctive disorder. Therefore, the present chapter reviews and discusses the clinical and distinctiveness features of this disorder, as well as the treatments of first choice (i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy).

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

Taste distortion or loss involves an impairment of this interaction and may be defined as dysgeusia (taste distortion), hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste), or ageusia (complete inability to taste). Medications have been reported to induce reversible and persistent taste disturbance in many patients. The mechanism by which medications alter taste is unknown, but there are many hypotheses. Patients may react to taste disturbances with decreased appetite, decreased dietary and nutrient intake, and/or increased use of salt or sugar. Management of taste disorders often includes discontinuation of the suspected offending agent. Clinicians should be proactive in identifying patients with taste alterations and in responding with appropriate interventions.",

      "title": "Anorexia in Exercise and Sport",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders that are associated with severe disturbances in eating behavior are called “eating disorders.” According to the American Psychiatric Association1, a mental disorder consists of “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” Of particular attention here is the eating disorder of anorexia nervosa. This disorder amounts to a refusal to maintain a normal body weight. In the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV, pp. 544–545), the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (See Table 1) are associated with physical symptoms (abnormal body weight, amenorrhea) and psychological symptoms (fear in gaining weight and body image disturbances).Table 1: A. Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia NervosaDiscussion: Although the incidence of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa is only about 1% in the U.S. population, its prevalence among athletes in sports that emphasize leanness has been estimated to be much higher. Part of this confusion comes from misinterpreting scores on questionnaires such as the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) or the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). These standardized instruments are not designed to determine psychopathology since it takes a clinical interview to determine if the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are met. Instead, the EDI and EAT are useful in determining who might be at risk for meeting the diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa. Athletes in sports that emphasize leanness will often have elevated scores on the drive for thinness scale of the EDI2. However, when athletes are subjected to a clinical interview, most of those classified as “at risk,” are not found to have a true clinical relevant “eating disorder.” Higher scores on the EDI, for instance, may be only be a rationale response on the part of the athlete and may not represent a clinical eating disorder. As O'Connor and Smith3 have pointed out, a higher drive for thinness score may merely represent a desire to perform well, especially in light of the time the athlete has devoted to the sport. Evidence from several sources suggests that athletes are more apt to have “subclinical or disordered eating patterns,” particularly when their sports are in-season. However, the disordered eating patterns seen in most athletes are not of the severity that would qualify as a clinically diagnosed eating disorder.",

Often these patients say they become ill when exposed to various odors, often in response to cacosmia (Ryan et al., 1988) or dysosmia (Miller, 1996). For example, they may describe everyday exposures to fragrances, diesel exhaust, new plastic car interiors, household cleaners, etc. (Table 1), as being overpowering, \"stronger than ever before,\" or \"extremely irritating\" and triggering symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, memory difficulties, mental confusion, anxiety, irritability, depression, myalgias, arrhythmias, dyspnea, and every sort of gastrointestinal problem (Table 2).

      "title": "[Endocrine abnormalities in anorexia nervosa].",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a syndrome with multifactorial etiology in which several genetic, biologic, psychological and social factors are involved. Patients affected by anorexia nervosa (AN) may develop multiple endocrine abnormalities, e.g. amenorrhea, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, low T3 syndrome and peculiar changes of somatotroph axis function. These endocrine abnormalities are also found after prolonged starvation and may represent an adaptive response developed in order to save energy and proteins. It is still a matter of debate whether these endocrine changes are etiologic or secondary. In fact, several evidences suggest the existence in AN of hypothalamus functional alterations, which may be involved in the development and maintenance of the food intake disorder; on the other hand, the increased CRH secretion seems to be secondary to malnutrition as well as GH hypersecretion coupled to low IGF-I levels; the latter is a common finding in AN, as well as in other undernutrition and malabsorption conditions, type 1 diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis and catabolic states. Hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is one of the diagnostic criteria for AN, is not linked only to the reduction of body weight but reflects also deep alterations of gonadotropin secretory pattern. Low T3 syndrome is frequently found in AN; on the other hand, an iodide-induced hypothyroidism is quite uncommon. T3 reduction in AN seems to be an adaptive response to prolonged starvation; however the presence of a simultaneous central dysregulation cannot be excluded. Finally, AN patients frequently show defects in urinary concentration or dilution with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which may be due to intrinsic defects in the neurohypophysis or to abnormalities of its regulatory afferent neurons.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

It is well recognized that a number of patients present with a feeding or eating disturbance that is difficult to classify and diagnose using DSM-IV criteria. 1 The frequent use of the diagnosis Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 2 has been widely discussed. 3 In addition, there are a number of presentations familiar to clinicians working in this field that simply do not fit current diagnostic placeholders. This is particularly the case in presentations characterized by restricted or otherwise inadequate eating, most commonly seen in child and adolescent populations, 4 but also in adults. 5 Examples include individuals who eat only a very narrow range of foods, and those who restrict their food intake to cope with difficult feelings, an emotional crisis, or an unpleasant experience. Such individuals do not fit the existing DSM-IV feeding and eating disorder diagnoses; yet they can experience clinically significant levels of impairment in development or functioning, as well as potentially severe medical complications.",

RAPOPOPiT* and ALAN FISKEf Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disease in which thoughts and habits run wild. Obsessive thoughts such as unreasonable doubts (am I a bad person? did I lock the door? do I have AIDS? did I harm someone?) or compulsive habits (praying, repeating, ordering, checking, cleaning, or washing) consume hours of the patients' time [I]. Typically, sufferers are aware that these symptoms are \"crazy\" but cannot control them. The ritualistic nature of OCD symptoms is striking. Repetitive counting or washing is accompanied by a sense that these behaviors are necessary to ward off discomfort or danger. Some OCD patients have commented on the similarity between their new and peculiar thoughts and behaviors and religious rituals or magical practices of other cultures. If the epidemiological studies are correct, as many as 2 million people in the United States have this disorder [2]. Until recently, most sufferers kept their disorder secret because of the embarrassment over the bizarre and irrational nature of their thoughts and rituals. The public awareness of the probable neurological nature of the disorder and the availability of effective treatments has increased recognition and referral of OCD patients . The last two decades of research have greatly advanced our understandCorrespondence : National Institute of Mental Health, Child Psychiatry Branch, Building 10, Room 3N202, fO Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892. *National Institute of Mental Health, Child Psychiatry Branch. \"(\"Department of Anthropology, University of California at Los Angeles, Box 951553.© 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Diverse lines of evidence indicate that dysfunction of cortical-basal ganglia circuitry underlies OCD. This raises important questions about the evolutionary basis for neural control of these behaviors. The existence of such specificity in the \"hard wiring \" of human behaviors as basic to everyday functions as cleaning, checking , and ordering, or concern about dangers to self or others, suggests a biological basis for universal categories of certain thoughts and rituals. The notion of psychiatric disorder asjust another part of medical biology is nothing new. However, some of the symptoms ofOCD—such as excessive prayer, ordering and counting, over-scrupulous concern about acceptable behavior, pollution, and purity, and rituals resembling imitative magic— are generally assumed to be culturally mediated and not thought to be so closely tied to specific brain circuitry. If there is a strong biological component , then the identity of these categories, their breadth, and how their mediating circuitry came to exist are exciting and researchable questions. The debates over such conceptualizations extend beyond psychiatry and medicine to touch linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology. The recent advances in the neurobiology ofOCD, with converging evidence from genetics, brain imaging, immunology, and epidemiology, now suggest empirical research on the universality of fundamental types of human action, and on the joint role of biology and culture in shaping such complex actions. This paper will review recent biological and anthropological studies of OCD in order to suggest ways in which the study of disease may illuminate some fundamental issues in the social and behavioral sciences. Biological Research on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder PHARMACOLOGY The new look at OCD began with studies showing that clomipramine, a tricyclic drug with average antidepressant and antianxiety effects, had unique efficacy in treating OCD [3, 4] . This medication, and the four others to date that are equally effective anti-obsessional treatments, have in common their ability to block the reuptake of serotonin by brain neurons, with relatively little effect on norepinephrine reuptake. More recently, more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice for this disorder because a large percent of patients can tolerate their side effects [5] . The efficacy of these serotonergic drugs (and lack of efficacy of antidepressants that block reuptake of norepinephrine) inspired a \"serotonin hypothesis\" of OCD [6]. However, the...",

      "abstract": "Many aspects of T1D, including glycemic variability throughout the day can trigger negative emotions. A particularly difficult aspect of blood glucose variability is physiologic mood symptoms that mimic depressed mood, such as irritability, lethargy, and difficulty concentrating, in addition to frustration and worry. Other negative emotions related to high or low blood glucose include frustration, self-blame, and failure. T1D devices were developed to help a person manage glucose, but they may be perceived by some youth to be burdensome because of the constant need to carry supplies. Other sources of burden include painful site changes, need to refill or replace supplies, device malfunctions, and sleep disruptions. Many children feel self-conscious about wearing devices, especially when they are visible on the body, with increased feelings of stigma occurring for some individuals with T1D. Children and parents may feel like their lives “revolve around T1D,” which can lead to diabetes distress, burnout, depression, and anxiety (see the Mood concerns and T1D chapter). Difficulties managing emotions are associated with suboptimal self-management, glycemic variability, and higher A1C. Developing coping strategies to manage emotions in response to T1D demands promotes better quality of life and T1D outcomes. In addition, negative emotions about T1D extend beyond the person with T1D to family members, and may increase A1C.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Characteristics of Accidents Attributed to the Driver Having Fallen Asleep",
      "abstract": "Even in non-sleep-deprived persons, sleepiness occurs at two particular periods of the day, i.e., during the night at the time of normal sleep and in the early afternoon, at the time of the siesta in certain cultures. This can be shown by measuring the physiological tendency to sleep as the latency to sleep in brief naps (Richardson, et al, 1982). Increases in sleepiness can result from sleep deprivation (inadequate sleep) or from sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Subjects who are excessively sleepy, from whatever cause, have performance lapses and slowed reaction times and an accelerated loss of attentional vigilance (Dinges, 1992). They, moreover will exhibit the phenomenon of microsleeps, i.e., sleepy subjects may fall asleep in an unpredictable fashion and be temporarily unaware of their surroundings. These behavioral changes that occur in sleepy individuals can have important consequences. The consequences will depend on the environment that the subject is in. Perhaps the most dangerous situation is while driving. Crashes occur in individuals who fall asleep at the wheel. Such crashes can be serious with resulting fatalities (Parsons, 1986). That this occurs has been known for some time (for review of earlier work in this area, see Shinar, 1978). The goal of the study described in this report was to investigate, in detail, the characteristics of accidents attributed on the police report to the driver having fallen asleep. The study was a retrospective analysis of data from the state of North Carolina. We analyzed data for the years 1990 to 1992, inclusive.

Contemporary methods used to reinstate normal eating such as persuasion, coaxing, spoon-feeding, insulin injections, tube-feeding, and others, can result in the patient being shaped or conditioned to eat only with assistance. Based on an experimental investigation of erratic eating in mental patients, the authors present a behavioural model for the identification and treatment of chronic refusal to eat. The syndrome of chronic anorexia is regarded largely as the acquired, learned, behaviour of rejecting food. When food rejection is not followed by social reinforcement it disappears in a relatively short period of time, and normal eating is reinstated.",

      "abstract": "The brain and the gut are linked together with a complex, bi-path link known as the gut-brain axis through the central and enteric nervous systems. So, the brain directly affects and controls the gut through various neurocrine and endocrine processes, and the gut impacts the brain via different mechanisms. Epilepsy is a central nervous system (CNS) disorder with abnormal brain activity, causing repeated seizures due to a transient excessive or synchronous alteration in the brain's electrical activity. Due to the strong relationship between the enteric and the CNS, gastrointestinal dysfunction may increase the risk of epilepsy. Meanwhile, about 2.5% of patients with epilepsy were misdiagnosed as having gastrointestinal disorders, especially in children below the age of one year. Gut dysbiosis also has a significant role in epileptogenesis. Epilepsy, in turn, affects the gastrointestinal tract in different forms, such as abdominal aura, epilepsy with abdominal pain, and the adverse effects of medications on the gut and the gut microbiota. Epilepsy with abdominal pain, a type of temporal lobe epilepsy, is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain. Epilepsy also can present with postictal states with gastrointestinal manifestations such as postictal hypersalivation, hyperphagia, or compulsive water drinking. At the same time, antiseizure medications have many gastrointestinal side effects. On the other hand, some antiseizure medications may improve some gastrointestinal diseases. Many gut manipulations were used successfully to manage epilepsy. Prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, a ketogenic diet, fecal microbiota transplantation, and vagus nerve stimulation were used successfully to treat some patients with epilepsy. Other manipulations, such as omental transposition, still need more studies. This narrative review will discuss the different ways the gut and epilepsy affect each other.",

Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "abstract": "Summary Bloating is a frequently reported symptom in functional bowel disorders. It usually occurs in combination with other symptoms, but may also occur in isolation. The severity of bloating tends to worsen during the course of the day and improves overnight. Although frequently considered to be a subjective phenomenon, recent studies have shown that bloating is associated with a measurable increase in abdominal girth. The pathophysiology of bloating remains elusive, but the evidence supports a sensorimotor dysfunction of the bowel. The possible mechanisms include abnormal gas trapping, fluid retention, food intolerance and altered gut microbial flora. Further studies are needed to define the sensorimotor abnormalities associated with bloating, which might be segmental and transient rather than generalized and persistent. The lack of understanding of this symptom is paralleled by a limited availability of therapeutic options. Conventional medications used in functional bowel disorders are not helpful and may indeed worsen the symptoms. In future, new drugs with activity against serotonin and kappa receptors, or novel approaches such as the use of exclusion diets, probiotics and hypnotherapy, may prove to be useful.",

      "abstract": "Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a type of constipation characterized by two or more of the following symptoms in more than 25 percent of defecation trials: straining, lumpy or hard stools, urgency, sense of incomplete evacuation, pelvic heaviness and manual maneuvers to promote defecation.obstructed defecation is of two basic types: functional and mechanical.The functional type involves idiopathic megarectum, anismus (pelvic floor dys-synergy), and descending perineal syndrome, while the mechanical type includes rectocele, enterocele, internal rectal intussusception and overt rectal prolapse.An excessive straining is likely to be the \"primummovens\", causing tissue weakness and organ descent, and often is due to longterm anxiety, muscle tension and resulting in non-relaxing puborectalis muscle.The increased straining causes pudendal nerve stretch which may lead to a pudendal neuropathy which affects the rectal sensations.ODS has been also defined as an \"iceberg syndrome\", as the two most frequent lesions, i.e., rectocele and rectal internal mucosal prolapse, present in more than 90% of patients with ODS, are easily detectable and may be considered \"emerging rocks\", whereas the \"surgical ship\" is likely to \"sink\" due to the \"underwater rocks\", i.e., the occult lesions.",

      "title": "Fatigue Versus Activity-Dependent Fatigability in Patients With Central or Peripheral Motor Impairments",
      "abstract": "In the rehabilitation literature, fatigue is a common symptom of patients with any neurological impairment when defined as a subjective lack of physical and mental energy that interferes with usual activities. Some complaints may, however, arise from fatigability , an objective decline in strength as routine use of muscle groups proceeds. By this refined definition of fatigue, exercise or sustained use reduces the ability of muscles to produce force or power, regardless of whether the task can be sustained. Fatigability may be masked clinically because (1) the degree of weakening is not profound, (2) activity-induced weakness rapidly lessens with cessation of exertion, and (3) clinicians rarely test for changes in strength after repetitive movements to objectively entertain the diagnosis. The repetitive movements that induce fatigability during daily activities are an iterative physiological process that depends on changing states induced by activation of spared central and peripheral neurons and axons and compromised muscle. Fatigability may be especially difficult to localize in patients undergoing neurorehabilitation, in part because no finite boundary exists between the central and peripheral components of motor reserve and endurance. At the bedside, however, manual muscle testing before and after repetitive movements could at least put some focus on the presence of fatigability in any patient with motor impairments and related disabilities. Reliable measures of fatigability beyond a careful clinical examination, such as physiological changes monitored by cerebral functional neuroimaging techniques and more standardized central and peripheral electrical and magnetic stimulation paradigms, may help determine the mechanisms of activity-dependent weakening and lead to specific therapies. Testable interventions to increase motor reserve include muscle strengthening and endurance exercises, varying the biomechanical requirements of repetitive muscle contractions, and training-induced neural plasticity or pharmacologic manipulations to enhance synaptic efficacy.",

People with insomnia can feel dissatisfied with their sleep and usually experience one or more of the symptoms like fatigue, low energy, difficulty concentrating, mood disturbances, and decreased performance in work. Insomnia may be characterized based on its duration. Acute insomnia is brief and often happens because of life circumstances. Many people might have experienced this type of passing sleep disruption, and it tends to resolve without any treatment. Chronic insomnia is disrupted sleep that occurs at least three nights per week and lasts at least three months. Chronic insomnia disorders can have many causes. Insomnia results due to an imbalance between sleep inducing neurotransmitters. There are few methods and indexes reported to study about the sleep disorders in insomnia patients like Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Even alcoholics who have been abstinent for short periods of time (i.e., several weeks) or extended periods of time (i.e., several years) may experience persistent sleep abnormalities. Researchers also found that alcoholics are more likely to suffer from certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea.

Here we describe a case of a 53-year-old man prescribed mirtazapine 15 mg/day for appetite stimulation who experienced anxiousness, nausea, tremor, loss of appetite, lack of desire for food, and an 8-pound weight loss after abrupt, inadvertent discontinuation. Symptom onset was acute and presented within 48-hours of stopping his medication. Mirtazapine was restarted at the same dose after 14 days of ongoing symptoms and his symptoms subsided immediately. Scant literature exists to highlight the potentially serious adverse events associated with abrupt mirtazapine discontinuation, even at low doses, and this case contributes to advocating for the need of mirtazapine taper when medication cessation is being considered.",

No pain medications required.2) Slight pain which lasts a bit longer, still able to perform usual tasks and again, if concentration is shifted away from the pain, the pain is forgotten about. No pain medications required.3) Pain is more noticeable and it comes and goes more frequently. Still able to perform usual tasks but it takes a bit of effort. Mild analgesic usually will help with this type of pain.4) The pain lasts for longer periods, it is much more noticeable and it is starting to bother and interfere with concentration and tasks requiring more effort and concentration. Mild analgesia should alleviate this type of pain, maybe more doses than one single dose may be required. A hot pack or ice pack may also help alleviate the pain.5) The Pain is now very noticeable, it is interfering with everyday tasks and a pain reliever is now required at 4 to 6 hourly intervals. Depending on the patient, someone with acute pain, may still respond well to mild analgesia probably at 4th hourly, maybe with added codeine (if the patient is able to take it) and even heat or ice may help with some relief of this level of pain.6) The Pain level is medium heading towards strong now and it is becoming more constant and it is not easily forgotten about. Pain relief is now required and it may need to be stronger than just mild analgesia, added codeine may help with the level of pain relief, this all depends on whether the pain is acute or chronic and on the patient's actual level of pain tolerance. A chronic pain patient may still have this level of pain even with strong pain relief.7) The pain level is now medium to strong and the pain is continuous. It is not relieved by mild to medium analgesia. Stronger narcotics are now required for pain relief. Chronic pain patients may still be at this level, even with strong narcotic pain relief. Heat may also aid with relief. Its becoming harder to concentrate due to the strength of the pain.8) The pain is becoming unbearable, strong narcotic pain relief is required. The chronic and acute pain patient will be irritable, hot and may be flushed, perspiration may be noticeable. Blood pressure may also be elevated. Patient may start to shake a bit if the pain has been going on for too long.9) The pain now is unbearable, only strong narcotic pain relief for the acute patient will help with the pain. The chronic pain patient will be irritable, the patient may be flushed and their palms are usually sweaty, blood pressure usually raised, pain relief needs to be increased and re-assessed. Nausea or vomiting may be present. The patient may be trembling or shaking due to the amount of pain, moaning and groaning may be present. Whether the pain is acute or chronic, the patient is usually unable to sleep or concentrate on the smallest task.10) The pain level is totally unbearable, the patient maybe vomiting or can even lose consciousness. The patient may also become delirious, moaning and groaning without making any sense. The blood pressure may still be elevated or by now may have dropped and the patient may go into shock. The patient must be treated by his/her symptoms, if cold, then the patient should be kept warm and if hot they should be cooled down. Pain relief is needed urgently. The patient may even become incontinent.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

Although the motor and vocal tics do not need to occur concurrently, the tics need to occur several times a day or more nearly every day or intermittently with no tic‐free interval of more than 3 months for the diagnosis to be given. Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

      "abstract": "A seizure is a brief disturbance of cerebral function, lasting from seconds to a few minutes, caused by an abnormal electrical discharge. Epilepsy is the tendency to have seizures on a chronic, recurrent basis, not resulting from a temporary condition. The term, epilepsy, does not presuppose a cause; there are many causes. Essentially, anything that disturbs the normal functioning of the cerebral cortex can cause seizures, and if this abnormality is enduring, it can result in epilepsy.1 Epilepsy is a common neurological condition with a global prevalence of 1.2 %. Most women with epilepsy who become pregnant or are planning to conceive are recommended to continue taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to minimise seizure recurrence during pregnancy, adverse effects to the fetus, and unintended ill consequences during labour and / or delivery.2,3 The seizure pattern during pregnancy may be influenced by variations in ovarian hormones, blood levels of antiepileptic drugs, and metabolic changes.4 Status epilepticus occurs in only 1 – 2 % of pregnancies,5 and if treated appropriately and aggressively carries a fairly low risk of morbidity and mortality. Structural and metabolic changes may precipitate new-onset seizures during pregnancy. The structural causes include intracranial haemorrhage of multiple types, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. Metabolic causes include hyperemesis gravidarum; acute hepatitis (due to fatty liver of pregnancy or viral hepatitis); metabolic diseases, such as acute intermittent porphyria; infections, such as malaria; and eclampsia.5 Evaluation and management should be performed in a stepwise fashion and may require a multidisciplinary approach with other specialties such as neurology.6 The threat of seizures during pregnancy and the consequences that they might have on the developing foetus are fundamental reasons for the prescription of daily antiepileptic medication to a pregnant woman with epilepsy (WWE).7 We present an original case of 3 episodes of seizures, of 22-year-old female who was 16 weeks pregnant. This study was approved by Sree Uthradom Thirunal Hospital, Pattom, Trivandrum, Kerala (ethics committee).",

Changes in the brain–gut–microbiome interactions, genetic polymorphisms (dopamine, opioid, leptin, and melanocortin-4 receptor), and altered connectivity in various brain circuits are some of the etiological factors for the development of FA. Depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, impaired decision-making, high impulsivity and neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, and extraversion are some of the risk factors for FA. When confronted with excess stress or burnout, predisposed individuals consume food for comfort-seeking and to avoid unpleasant emotions placing them at a greater risk of FA. Lifestyle modification, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, cognitive training, psychobiotics, low carbohydrate ketogenic therapy, self-help groups, virtual reality, and neuromodulation techniques can be incorporated into the management of FA. Unless FA and its comorbidities are identified and managed appropriately, it will impede weight loss, and the results of interventions for the management of obesity will not be sustained. Preventive strategies include early identification and management of at-risk adolescents, incorporating programs promoting healthy food choices and eating habits, and more regulation of pleasurable foods in child and youth settings. The onus of taking responsibility to implement measures to curb FA lies with the food industry, governments through statutory regulations, and the society at large.",

Recently, a circadian variability has been reported also for the occurrence of renal colic, with a pattern characterized by a morning peak, independent of gender and presence or not of demonstrable kidney stones. Most, if not all, renal functions exhibit temporal changes e.g. glomerular filtration rate, urine production and renal excretion of solutes, leading to an increased night-time concentration of urine, which could act as a predisposing factor for the morning occurrence of renal colic attacks.",

These include aspects of parental control in FBT, collaborative weighing, self-monitoring and eating schedules/meal plans, and psychoeducation about food and weight. Achieving weight gain is particularly difficult in anorexia nervosa due to fear and preoccupation with weight, eating and “becoming fat.” Low body weight and malnourishment tends to increase anxiety and obsessionality, so weight gain early on is paramount, especially for individuals with this co-occurring presentation. Through clinical observations, patients have reported that FBT may aggravate OCD symptoms, such as preoccupation with numbers and exactness, and expanding obsessionality to concerns about exercise/movement and other topics within the morality domain of OCD. The lack of control and greater uncertainty that an adolescent experiences while completing FBT may be related to increased OCD symptomatology and poor treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia (ie, awakening to void one or more times per night) is common in adults, with increasing prevalence in older age. Nocturia is associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. In general, mechanisms for nocturia fall into one of four categories: increased nighttime urine production, decreased storage ability, incomplete bladder emptying, or primary sleep disorder. Although screening for nocturia currently is not recommended, patients reporting bothersome symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Initial workup includes assessing urinary symptoms, fluid intake, and comorbidities. Using validated nocturia questionnaires and frequency-volume charts (bladder diaries) can aid in diagnosis. A urinalysis should be performed for all patients. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies for nocturia. Limitation of fluid intake, especially in the evening; addressing timing of diuretic intake; and sleep hygiene are recommended. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for those unresponsive to lifestyle modifications and adequate treatment of comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should target the etiology of nocturia, such as nocturnal polyuria, overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for further treatment (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, sacral neuromodulation, surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia).",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "abstract": "Variables associated with physical activity show circadian rhythms in resting subjects; these rhythms have both exogenous (due to the individual's lifestyle and environment) and endogenous (due to the \"body clock\") components. During exercise, many of the rhythms persist, even though some show decreasing amplitude with increasing severity of exercise. Whilst the value of physical fitness is not disputed (for elite athletes, for individuals who just want to be physically fit, or for patients undertaking physical rehabilitation regimens), there are certain times of the day when special care is needed. These times are soon after waking--when there is the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and damage to the spine--and late in the day--when there is an increased risk of respiratory difficulties. Since physical exercise is inextricably linked with thermoregulation, there are special considerations to bear in mind when exercise takes place in cold or hot environments. Further, due to the effects of the body clock, exercise and activity during night work and after time-zone transitions presents problems peculiar to these circumstances. In addition, the menstrual cycle affects physical performance, and these circatrigintan rhythms interact with the circadian ones. Bearing in mind these factors, advice that is based upon knowledge of circadian and circatrigintan rhythms can be given to all those contemplating physical activity. Chronobiologically, there is advantage in undertaking physical activity programmes towards the middle of the waking day and not at times when a sleep or nap has just been taken.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 narcolepsy is a disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy, an abrupt and transient episode of muscle weakness in the setting of consciousness typically precipitated by emotions. Deficiency of the hypocretin-orexin axis is common in human type 1 narcolepsy. EDS typically precedes cataplexy by several years in type 1 narcolepsy. It is atypical for narcoleptics to enter sleep in the course of cataplexy. We present an unusual course of cataplexy where the muscle atonia of cataplexy evolves into physiologically documented REM sleep. A 20-year-old morbidly obese female (BMI 41.09kg/m2) seropositive for HLA DQB1*0602 presented to the sleep clinic with 3 to 5 daily episodes of muscle atonia/sleep attacks episodes provoked by emotions and excessive daytime sleepiness (sleeping 10 hours per day, Epworth 18), with onset 02/2016 and 2005, respectively. Past history is remarkable for postural orthostatic tachycardia, migraines, and intracranial hypertension (ICH) with functional ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted 08/23/16. She was not taking psychoactive agents. On examination she had abrupt loss of muscle tone followed shortly by visible REM. She was conscious for the initial portion of the seven minutes before restoration of muscle tone. A 16 lead EEG during an unprovoked atonia/sleep attack was negative for epilepsy. Overnight polysomnography revealed a total sleep time of 495.5 minutes, apnea hypopnea index 2.5, and respiratory disturbance index 2.8. Multiple sleep latency test had mean sleep latency of 2.25 minutes and sleep onset REM in 4 of 5 naps. Laughter provoked atonia was captured after the 5th nap with EEG prompt transition to REM sleep (video and EEG tracings available). Sodium Oxybate therapy proved effective in increasing alertness and reducing episodes of atonia/sleep attacks. Cataplexy evolving to REM sleep is an atypical feature of this case. ICH may have played a facilitating role in this case.",

Evidence for this linkage comes from a literature review, from patient interviews, from responses to an instrument we have developed (the Self‐Harm Behavior Survey), and from three instructive case reports. Even if the self‐mutilation in these patients is regarded as a Borderline Personality Disorder symptom, DSM‐IV should list it as an associated feature or a complication of Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia Nervosa. In lieu of a dual diagnosis, we postulate that the combination of self‐mutilation, anorexia, bulimia, and other symptoms (such as episodic alcohol abuse and swallowing foreign objects) may be manifestations of an impulse control disorder known as the “deliberate self‐harm syndrome.”",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs, It is most commonly reported with combinations of serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Eating disorders and sexual function",
      "abstract": "Women suffering from eating disorders, present considerable retardation and difficulties in their psychosexual development during adolescence. This leads to primary or secondary insufficiencies in their adult sexual life. The cause of these difficulties seems to be a series of biological, family and psychosocial factors. The majority of the research findings indicate that eating disorders have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The factors related to eating disorders symptomatology that influence sexuality are various and differ among each eating disorder diagnostic categories. Considering anorexia nervosa, it has been reported that women have negative attitudes to sexual issues and their body. Their sexual motivation increases when they engage in psychotherapy and their body weight is gradually restored. Starvation and its consequences on the human physiology and especially on the brain function seem to be the main factor that leads to reduced sexual desire and scarce sexual activity. Moreover, personality traits that are common in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa such as compulsivity and rigidity are also related with difficulties initiating and retaining romantic and sexual relationships. Usually patients suffering from anorexia nervosa report impaired sexual behavior and lack of interest to engage in a sexual relationship. Considering Bulimia Nervosa, impulsivity and difficulties in emotion regulation that are common features of the individuals that suffer from bulimia nervosa are also related to impulsive and sometimes self-harming sexual behaviors. Moreover women sufferers often report repulsion, anger and shame towards their body and weight, mainly due to the distorted perception that they are fat and ugly. It is interesting that a number of research findings indicate that although patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are more sexually active and have more sexual experiences than patients suffering from anorexia nervosa, both groups of patients report more often than general population a lack of satisfaction from their sexual experiences. Other factors that are common to eating disorders and sexual dysfunction are personality traits, negative body-image, adverse childhood experiences, negative family climate and especially early traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, comorbidity of eating disorders with depression may have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The treatment and improvement of sexual behavior is quite problematic when the patient is also suffering from an eating disorder. Eating Disorder patients are often very reluctant to discuss their sexual life with the therapist and to engage in any kind of therapeutic intervention. Comorbidity with a number of other disorders makes psychotherapy even more difficult for those patients. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of Anorexia Nervosa patients do not have any kind of sexual activity, at least until nutrition and weight are restored.",

      "title": "Seasonal Affective Disorder and HPA axis function: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Seasonal Affective Disorder and HPA axis function: A Systematic Review. BRUNO AGUSTINI1*, Maria Bocharova1, Allan Young1 and Mario F. Juruena1 1 King's College London, Centre for Affective Disorders/Dept of Psychological Medicine, United Kingdom Background: Life on earth is dictated by constant, yet predictable, changes in environment, a consequence of earth’s movements and the seasons that derive from it. For virtually all animals, the environment will vary markedly according to these changes. Different seasons require special strategies and different behavioural, energetic, metabolic and immunological priorities. These changes are clearly demonstrated in animal models, but there is still insufficient data to characterize robust seasonal changes in humans. One condition, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), may provide the best example, in an extreme form, of this variability. SAD is known as a form of depression that usually occurs in the winter, and is typically characterized by atypical symptoms, with fatigue, hyperphagia, craving for carbohydrate-rich foods and weight gain observed in these depressive episodes, frequently preceding the functional impairments seen afterwards. Based on the energy-conserving nature of these core symptoms of SAD, various evolutionary theories have been proposed, suggesting a shift in metabolic strategies. Nevertheless, the etiology and pathophysiology of the condition remains unclear. So far, evidence points to external, environmental factors, especially related to perceived day light and day length and/or internal, molecular and genetic clocks with chronobiological functions. Another common finding related to SAD are disturbances in serotonin genes, production and transportation. All these different pathways will, ultimately, have some of their actions via bidirectional inputs in the hypothalamus. So, it seems logical that we may find alterations in hypothalamic outputs in this condition, especially in the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Although anecdotal reports characterize SAD as a hypocortisolemic condition (together with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Depression with atypical features), there are no systematic reviews on SAD and HPA axis function. This review intends to summarize these findings and improve our understanding of this highly prevalent, often predictable, yet little understood, mood disorder. Methods: Using the PRISMA (2009) guideline recommendations and the PRISMA NMA checklist (2015), we searched for relevant articles indexed in databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PsychArticles, using the Ovid platform. The following keywords were used: \"Seasonal affective disorder\", OR \"Winter Depression\", OR \"Seasonal depression\" associated with: “HPA Axis” OR “cortisol” OR “atypical depression” OR “melancholic depression”. We included full text articles, in humans, written in English language, with no temporal limits. Animal studies and review articles were excluded. Results: A total of 151 articles were found. After thorough screening and selection, a total of 14 articles were included in the qualitative analysis. We divided these studies in 4 groups: 1) Baseline and variation: Just one study (2011) measured baseline cortisol levels in saliva, and found that the cortisol awakening response was lower in patients with SAD compared with healthy controls. Diurnal variation was the same between groups; 2) Studies with Dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (n=2): these showed conflicting results, with one study finding normal DST, while other, comparing with Schizophrenic patients, found lower baseline cortisol levels and less suppression after DST, in winter, for SAD patients; 3) Studies using Serotonin agonists (n=6): these also showed discrepant results, with 4 of the studies finding no significant difference between SAD patients and controls, and 2 studies indicating lower cortisol levels in SAD patients after challenge with 5HT agonists; 4) Studies with light therapy (n=5): showed normal baseline cortisol levels for patients with SAD compared to healthy controls. One of this studies found delayed circadian rhythm in patients with SAD in the winter, and that light therapy advances these rhythms in SAD patients, bringing them closer to healthy controls; another study found that \"natural light” (walk in the street) was more effective, and reduced salivary cortisol, compared to patients undergoing artificial light treatment (this study has the obvious confounder of physical activity). Conclusion: There is some evidence for lower basal cortisol levels in patients with SAD, and symptomatic improvement (with light therapy or serotonin agonists) may be correlated with alterations in HPA axis function, but this is far from consolidated. All the studies were conducted with heterogeneous populations and methods, leading to discrepant results. The common association of SAD and low cortisol levels still needs to be confirmed by larger samples and more homogeneous methods. The use of salivary cortisol, present in only 2 studies, can help in that task, providing a non-invasive and reliable procedure to monitor these subjects. No study tried to correlate cortisol levels with specific vegetative symptoms, what may also lead to more robust results. Another interesting finding is that the number of studies with SAD tended to decrease with time (which partially explains the small use of salivary cortisol as measure). This might be explained by controversies around its diagnostic validity. If we look beyond diagnostic criteria, with its inherent limitations and artificial boundaries (if it is a separate condition, a type of bipolar disorder or even a type of depression), SAD appears to be an important window of opportunity to understand the intrinsic connection of mood disorders and circadian rhythms. We suggest that more studies, temporally synchronized and homogeneously designed, with more modern and available techniques, may provide key insights to our understanding of mood disorders and circadian rhythms as a whole, being of the utmost importance.

      "abstract": "A 4-year-old neurotypical boy presented with unprovoked, involuntary intermittent tremulousness of the chin lasting for few minutes to hours, noted from 18 months of age with no family history ([Video 1]). These movements were absent during sleep. The neurological examination, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography was otherwise normal. Surface electromyography of the mentalis muscle demonstrated a tremor frequency of 8 Hz ([Video 2]). Quivering chin syndrome is a rare movement disorder. It may be sporadic or inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance with locus on chromosome 9(9q13-q21). These involuntary, paroxysmal, rhythmic, movements of the chin and/or lower lip may last from seconds to hours.[1] Episodes occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by stress and emotion. Usually no treatment is required. When indicated, injection of low-dose botulinum toxin into the mentalis muscle or low-dose clonazepam may be helpful.[2] Recognition of this rare entity is important to avoid unnecessary investigations.",

These symptoms are parts of the discontinuation syndrome and are very different from relapse or recurrence. The discontinuation syndrome appears within 1 week and lasts about 3 weeks after discontinuation of the antidepressant. In the vast majority of cases, the symptomatology is self-limiting. Sometimes, in the presence of a severe syndrome, reintroduction of the antidepressant induces a rapid resolution of the symptoms. In fact, the discontinuation of the antidepressant should be progressive.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the limbs during periods of prolonged rest or inactivity. It disproportionately affects women and occurs in one in five pregnant women. RLS can be idiopathic or secondary, when it occurs with iron deficiency, renal failure, medications, and neurological or rheumatological disease. Periodic limb movements are frequent but not specific to RLS. Identifying the frequency of symptoms can guide management. Treatment is with iron supplementation if deficient and with low-dose dopamine agonists or gabapentin used as first-line medications. Augmentation can occur with long-term treatment with dopamine agonists. Treatment during pregnancy differs from routine guidelines due to the risk of teratogenicity.",

      "title": "Utilizing Multi-Class Classification Methods for Automated Sleep Disorder Prediction",
      "abstract": "Even from infancy, a human’s day-life alternates from a period of wakefulness to a period of sleep at night, during the 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a normal process necessary for human physical and mental health. A lack of sleep makes it difficult to control emotions and behaviour, reduces productivity at work, and can even increase stress or depression. In addition, poor sleep affects health; when sleep is insufficient, the chances of developing serious diseases greatly increase. Researchers in sleep medicine have identified an extensive list of sleep disorders, and thus leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate their analysis and gain a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and related disorders. In this research, we seek a Machine Learning (ML) solution that will allow for efficient classification of unlabeled instances as being Sleep Apnea, Insomnia or Normal (subjects without a specific sleep disorder) by assessing the performance of two well-established strategies for multi-class classification tasks: the One-Vs-All (OVA) and One-Vs-One (OVO). In the context of the specific strategies, two well-known binary classification models were assumed, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Both strategies’ validity was verified upon a dataset of diverse information related to the profiles (anthropometric data, sleep metrics, lifestyle and cardiovascular health factors) of potential patients or individuals not exhibiting any specific sleep disorder. Performance evaluation was carried out by comparing the weighted average results in all involved classes that represent these two specific sleep disorders and no-disorder occurrence; accuracy, kappa score, precision, recall, f-measure, and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were recorded and compared to identify an effective and robust model and strategy, both class-wise and on average. The experimental evaluation unveiled that after feature selection, 2-degree polynomial SVM under both strategies was the least complex and most efficient, recording an accuracy of 91.44%, a kappa score of 84.97%, precision, recall and f-measure equal to 0.914, and an AUC of 0.927.",

Circadian rhythm disorders result when there is a misalignment between an individual’s physiological rhythm and the environment. This can result from an intrinsic inability to entrain with the external environment, or from environmental demands that force desynchrony (e.g., shift work). This chapter will provide an overview of the currently recognized circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders: delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder, non-24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, shift work disorder, and jet lag disorder. The chapter also provides a discussion of current treatment recommendations.",

      "abstract": "A 69-year-old man with alcohol dependence and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) suffered from repeated tonic-clonic seizures. The seizures typically occurred several hours after his last alcohol intake at home (early withdrawal seizure) and 22 days after his last intake of alcohol (14 days after the last dose of diazepam substituting for alcohol: late withdrawal seizure) on the ward. Psychiatrists in charge of this patient found it difficult to attribute his seizures to alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) because of the atypical onset. The patient responded to diazepam resumption and valproate combination. This case highlights the need to always consider AWS as a possible cause of seizures and to gradually decrease diazepam as a substitute for alcohol. Moreover, in this patient, MCI may have induced vulnerability in the brain for AWS and the patients' older age might have decreased liver function leading to delayed onset of the seizures after diazepam withdrawal.",

Obesity is not considered an eating disorder because \"it is not generally associated with any distinctly psychological or behavioral syndrome\" (p. 65). If, however, \"psychological factors are of importance in the etiology or course of a particular case of obesity, this can be indicated by noting Psychological Factors Affecting Physical Condition\" (p. 65).",

      "abstract": "The following are key factors to consider in assessing a patient for long-term neuroleptics: 1. Who--accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia is of primary concern. There are no good prognostic indicators other than a history of repeated relapses and positive responses to neuroleptics. 2. When and for how long--should always be considered for the patient who has had more than two acute episodes. The first year post-acute episode back in the community is extremely critical. Consider maintaining patient on tapering dosage of medication for at least four to five years. 3. What benefits--symptoms of acute psychosis respond, those of chronic defect state do not. Medication also can act as buffer against stress. 4. Dosages--standard range is the equivalent of 300-800 mg. of Thorazine for most patients. Dose range for depot administration of Prolixin decanoate is 25-62.5 mg. 2-4 week intervals. Differences within this range may not be important. Data about very low doses (one-tenth standard dose) and megadoses (4-5 times standard dose) are inconsistent. 5. Risks--extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and akinetic depression are the most prevalent risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms can often be controlled effectively with dosage reduction. However, anticholinergic drugs are the treatment of choice during acute phases, and for the first 3-5 months post-acute phase. Tardive dyskinesia rarely occurs after a few weeks or months, but occurs most commonly beginning after two years of drug treatment. The usual form is persistent, but transient forms also occur. The earliest signs are reversible in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "Emotional eating is a maladaptive generalized behavior to regulate emotions as a momentary solution, and it is characterized by excessive food intake during states of emotional excitement or stress. The heart rate variability (HRV) as an evaluative parameter of emotional regulation indicates that the decrease of the vagal tone in the HRV is positively related to deficient self-regulation that might be associated with dysfunctional styles such as emotional eating. The explanatory emotional eating theory sustains this physiological mechanism by suggesting the sympathetic nervous system's activation and the existence of physiological incompatibilities between the action of eating and the presence of negative emotions which, instead of inhibiting the intake, boosts it. Nevertheless, evidence on the relation between the HRV and emotional eating demonstrates a predominance of the vagal response against the lower food stimulus under stress conditions.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Clinical criteria have trouble distinguishing addictions, on the one hand, from, on the other hand, appetites—like our appetites for food and water—and non-addictive passions that guide our lives, from serious hobbies to parenting. The simplest explanation of how addictions are distinct from non-addictive appetites and passions is that addictive behavior reveals some misvaluation by the addict, that the addict is wrong to act as she does. Psychological evidence supports this philosophical proposal by explaining how such a misvaluation is reinforced, namely by the addict’s acting in unthinking, impulsive ways. This reinforcement explains addiction’s chronic resistance to contrary evidence. This proposal neatly accounts for the questions left unanswered by standard diagnostic criteria of addiction.",

      "title": "Frontal lobe seizures",
      "abstract": "This video teaching course presents several patterns of frontal lobe seizures recorded in a number of Italian Epilepsy Centers*. The general features of frontal lobe seizures are outlined in the introduction. Sixteen video-EEG sequences involving 10 different patients are shown. A short presentation of the clinical history precedes each case report. The electroclinical characteristics of seizures implicating the frontal lobe are extremely variable. According to the literature, general characteristics allowing differentiation between seizures of different topography include: appearance of seizures in clusters; seizures predominantly nocturnal or while the patient is falling asleep; short duration of each episode (approximately 30 s); abrupt onset and end; relatively short post-ictal phase, when present; frequent secondary generalization and falls; frequent subjective sensations, usually difficult to describe; impairment of consciousness is not a constant feature; episodes of status are frequent; differentiation from pseudo-seizures may prove to be difficult. When confirmation of the epileptic nature of paroxysmal phenomena is needed, video-EEG recordings may be of some help. Possible subjective manifestations are: cephalic and neuro-vegetative (even epigastric) manifestations, as well as pensee forcee, fear, olfactory hallucinations, non-lateralized visual disturbances. Motor manifestations include tonic, dystonic, postural, oculocephalic deviations and falls. Verbal and more often gestural automatisms can be complex, very brief and often violent, but elementary automatisms, such as automatic hand and mouth movements, or bimanual and pedaling movements, are also frequent. In this video teaching course, we first present seizures featuring minimal motor signs, followed by seizures with a more complex semiology. The most significant clinical and EEG features are discussed. (Published with videosequences.)",

      "title": "THE FIRST TRIP",
      "abstract": "In this paper, it is suggested that the first use of hallucinogenic drugs often occurs during a life crisis which requires a more autonomous level of functioning. On the one hand, the person wishes to be more self-sufficient; on the other, he wishes to regress to a more dependent state. By taking the drug, he unconsciously hopes it will resolve this dilemma by making him unable to cope without making him feel ashamed of his incapacity. Three case histories are presented to illustrate this type of response. Drug use may also be due to the opposite wish—to become more powerful and able to cope with a crisis. Such unconscious coping mechanisms may often determine the first use of drugs and may also explain why many people are only occasional users. Habitual drug use may occur if concomitant feelings of depression and alienation are relieved, or if pleasure or insight are experienced. Since the psychodynamic determinants of drug use vary for different groups and individuals, it is probably useful and necessary to delineate them in greater detail so as to gain a better understanding of a multicausal phenomenon.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

Importantly, there are elements of addiction that emerge during the addiction trajectory (e.g. liking, wanting, habit, craving) that are a reflection of key changes in the homeostasis of brain networks that control different behaviours. These homeostatic changes ultimately lead to 1) a decreased sensitivity for natural rewards, 2) an enhanced sensitivity for conditioned substance cues and the expectation of substance use rewards, 3) a weakened control over substance use urges and substance-taking behaviour, and 4) substance tolerance and withdrawal. Significantly, these changes are targets for pharmacological and psychological treatment interventions in addiction.",

      "title": "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or more physical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met. Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis. As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws—a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")—could be recorded as \"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.",

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

The loss of interest or pleasure that depressed patients experience (anhedonia) also responds poorly to SSRIs, and patients often complain of emotional indifference or blunting.

      "abstract": "In this Clinical practice guide we examine the diagnostic and therapeutic management of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, at the confluence of the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. Both fall within the framework of functional intestinal disorders and have major personal, health and social impact, altering the quality of life of the patients affected. The former is a subtype of irritable bowel syndrome in which constipation and altered bowel habit predominate, often along with recurring abdominal pain, bloating and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterised by infrequent or hard-to-pass bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or the sensation of incomplete evacuation. There is no underlying organic cause in the majority of cases; it being considered a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between the two conditions, the constipation responds in a similar way to commonly used drugs, the fundamental difference being the presence or absence of pain, but not in an \"all or nothing\" way. The severity of these disorders depends not only on the intensity of the intestinal symptoms but also on other biopsychosocial factors: association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, degree of involvement, forms of perception and behaviour. Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical practice guide adapts to the Rome IV criteria published at the end of May 2016. The first part (96, 97, 98) examined the conceptual and pathophysiological aspects, alarm criteria, diagnostic test and referral criteria between Primary Care and Gastroenterology. This second part reviews all the available treatment alternatives (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fibre-rich foods, fibre supplements, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antdepressants, psychological treatment, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation and surgery), and practical recommendations are made for each.",

      "title": "Behavioural pharmacology of impulse control",
      "abstract": "Impulsivity is defined in one of the papers included in this Special Issue as ‘a human behaviour characterized by the inclination of an individual to act on urge rather than thought, with diminished regard to consequences’. Impulsivity is multidimensional in nature, with a distinction often drawn between impulsive action, where rapid responses to situations lead to adverse consequences that could have been avoided by withholding the prepotent response, and impulsive choice where a less beneficial outcome is preferred to a more beneficial outcome that is longer delayed or less certain. Disordered impulse control is a major feature (in some cases, the central feature) of many psychiatric disorders, including addiction to drugs or alcohol, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder, obesity, gambling, aggression and self-harm. This has given rise to animal models addressing both impulsive action and impulsive choice. An interesting and to some extent unusual feature of animal models in this area is that very similar procedures can be used to study impulsivity in animals and in humans. This is true of both impulsive action (for example, multichoice serial reaction time tasks) and impulsive choice (e.g. temporal discounting tasks). The use of these homologous animal models has provided insights into the neural substrates of impulsivity, which include a major focus on neurochemical (particularly, dopamine) systems in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex in, respectively, promoting and inhibiting impulsivity. There is a striking overlap between these foci and those of addiction research, which is hardly surprising considering the central role of impulsivity in addictions. This Special Issue opens with two reviews that illustrate different dimensions of impulsivity. The first, by Fenu et al., reviews the state of knowledge regarding the impulsive–compulsive behaviours that are an occasional concomitant of dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease. These include the so-called ‘dopamine dysregulation syndrome’, involving stereotyped behaviours and addiction to dopamine agonists, as well as compulsive patterns of sexuality, gambling, shopping and eating. The review concludes that sensitization of dopamine D3 receptors may lie at the root of these problems. The second review, by Setlow et al., is concerned with impulsive choice. It is well established that impulsive personality traits predispose individuals to addiction, and conversely, that psychostimulants such as cocaine increase impulsivity. The review brings together studies in animal models using temporal discounting procedures (i.e. the preference for small immediate over larger delayed rewards), which show that chronic psychostimulant administration causes a long-lasting increase in impulsive choice. Whether such an outcome follows chronic exposure to other abused drugs remains to be determined. The scope of behavioural pharmacology includes papers that are technically outside the field of behavioural pharmacology but nonetheless of interest and relevance to behavioural pharmacologists. The first empirical study, by Meda et al., presents a factor analysis of a number of self-report measures of impulsivity alongside two behavioural tests of impulsive choice in a sample that included people who were at risk of substance abuse or addicted. The choice tests measured preference for short-term over long-term rewards (temporal discounting) and risk taking. The results confirm the often-reported finding that self-report and behavioural measures of impulsivity are largely independent. However, it was additionally reported that the two choice tests also were independent, meaning that impulsive choice is itself a multidimensional construct, and suggesting that the heavy emphasis on temporal discounting tasks in the experimental literature may not be entirely appropriate. Be this as it may, the Special Issue continues with nine papers based on the use of temporal discounting procedures, five of them examining the effects of experimental manipulations on impulsive choice. Two of these, by Dandy and Gatch and by Anker et al., concern the effects of chronic cocaine exposure. (Both of these papers are included in the review by Setlow et al.) Dandy and Gatch examined changes in temporal discounting over time during chronic exposure to cocaine and during postcocaine exposure. They report that impulsive choice increased during cocaine exposure, and at high doses, recovered slowly. Anker et al. examined the effect of chronic cocaine exposure in groups of rats designated as high or low on impulsive behaviour (assessed using a go/no-go task). They report the interesting finding that cocaine increased impulsive choice in animals that were initially low on impulsive action, but not in high-impulsive action animals. A short report by Hand et al., also examined a group difference in the pharmacology of temporal discounting. Similar to the finding of Anker et al., Hand et al. report that amphetamine, administered acutely, increased impulsivity in a low-impulsive (Wistar–Kyoto) rat strain, but had no effect in a high-impulsive (SHR) strain. This was unexpected because the SHR strain has been promoted as a model of ADHD, a condition in which psychostimulants are used therapeutically to decrease impulsivity. Various potential explanations of this discrepancy are discussed, none conclusive. All the studies discussed so far used operant choice procedures to assess temporal discounting. A simpler procedure presents a choice between small immediate and large delayed rewards in a T-maze. There is considerable evidence from this procedure that high levels of 5HT function are associated with decreases in impulsive choice. However, Hadamitzky et al. report that impulsive choice was increased by a 5HT2 receptor agonist, implying that the relationship between 5HT activity and waiting is not so simple and differentially involves 5HT receptor subtypes. Returning to the operant paradigm, Slezak and Anderson present a methodological study of the effect of varying the order in which different delays of reinforcement were presented. This did not influence temporal discounting; and as in earlier studies, impulsive choice was increased by amphetamine. Finally, in this section, in a study displaying an impressive level of conceptual sophistication, Bezzina et al. present a detailed behavioural analysis of the effect on temporal discounting of another manipulation, lesion to the subthalamic nucleus. Using a mathematical model, they demonstrate that, while this manipulation does increase choice of the immediate alternative, the mechanism is an increase in sensitivity to the immediate reinforcer rather than discounting the value of the delayed reinforcer. Three further studies have examined the influence of temporal discounting on other behaviours (rather than effects of manipulations on temporal discounting). As noted earlier, impulsivity both increases and is increased by psychostimulant use. The abuse liability of a commonly prescribed psychostimulant, methylphenidate, is uncertain. Here, Mariusch and Bardo report that self-administration of a low dose of methylphenidate was higher in rats that had previously been identified as impulsive in a temporal discounting procedure. In a comparable study in humans, Fields et al. report that adolescent smokers were more impulsive in a temporal discounting procedure than were nonsmokers. The smokers also reported higher levels of stress, and a mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between stress and smoking was mediated by temporal discounting. They suggest that stress may induce a shift in attention to short-term goals, and under these circumstances, cigarettes provide self-medication. In a conceptually related study, Mueller et al. report that the degree of temporal discounting predicted the length of time that (adult) smokers were able to abstain from smoking. Abstinence was also predicted by the reinforcement schedule and by measures of executive functioning. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for contingency management procedures for treating addiction. In the final section of this Special Issue, we move from impulsive choice to impulsive action. The first four of these papers deal with various influences on perseverative behaviours, which are characteristic of disorders such as ADHD. First, a short report by Olmstead et al. reports that chronic prenatal alcohol exposure, which is known to increase impulsivity and perseveration in children and adults born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, also increased impulsive action and perseveration in guinea pigs, which may provide a useful model for further studies. Next, Tsutsui-Kimura et al. describe a new procedure, the 3-choice serial reaction time task (a simpler and easier-to-learn version of the widely used 5-choice task). In this task rats are required to respond to a visual stimulus that can appear in various locations, and impulsivity is measured as the number of premature responses. Impulsivity was increased in this study by nicotine, and decreased by noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (but not by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Using a 2-choice version of the serial reaction time task, Van Gaalen et al. show that the effect of amphetamine to increase impulsive action was blocked by a D2-receptor-preferring antagonist, but not by a selective D3-receptor antagonist, suggesting strongly that amphetamine-induced behavioural disinhibition is mediated by D2 rather than D3 receptors (unlike the situation in Parkinson's disease discussed in the review by Fenu et al.). The nature of the compulsive behaviours elicited by D2-like agonists in Parkinson's disease, and in a variety of animal models, is the context for the final paper in this group, by Collins and Woods. On the basis of a series of experiments in rats trained to nose poke for cocaine, they argue that the D2-like agonist quinpirole is not reinforcing in its own right, but is able to maintain perseverative patterns of responding by enhancing the conditioned reinforcing effects of stimuli previously paired with a primary reinforcer. The Special Issue ends with four studies examining aspects of excessive behaviours: drug addiction, binge drinking, gambling and binge eating. Sensation seeking is strongly associated with impulsivity, and young people scoring high on sensation seeking scales are at high risk for initiating drug use and developing addiction. Kelly et al. report that, among young adults screened several years earlier for sensation seeking, high sensation seekers were more responsive to the subjective, physiological and performance and cognitive effects of both psychostimulant (amphetamine) and sedative (diazepam) drugs of abuse. In a survey of university students, Balodis et al. report that self-reported impulsivity was correlated (albeit weakly) with a measure of binge drinking, and with more positive expectations of alcohol. (The main finding of this study was a strong gender difference in expectations of alcohol, which was not, however, related to impulsivity). Thomsen et al. report on a strong correlation between levels of depression and various measures of gambling urges and behaviour, which they relate to the literature on the role of dopamine systems in depression and addiction. Finally, Corwin and Wojnicki have investigated the effects of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine and opioid ligands on fat and sucrose consumption in a rat model of binge eating. The results point to an involvement of GABAB receptors in fat but not sucrose intake, and suggest that GABAB agonists may be useful clinically to decrease high-fat food intake. Altogether, the papers included in this special issue provide a rich contribution to the literature on the behavioural pharmacology of impulse control, in relation to both impulsive choice and impulsive action. This body of literature also provides a classic illustration of the potential for cross talk and integration that can be created by the use of different experimental methods addressing the same issue, and when similar experimental methods are applied in different species.

      "abstract": "Findings and recommendations on the assessment and treatment of adults with acute low back problems — activity limitations due to symptoms in the low back and/ or back-related leg symptoms of less than 3 months’ duration — are presented in this clinical practice guideline. The following are the principal conclusions of this guideline: • The initial assessment of patients with acute low back problems focuses on the detection of “red flags” (indicators of potentially serious spinal pathology or other nonspinal pathology). • In the absence of red flags, imaging studies and further testing of patients are not usually helpful during the first 4 weeks of low back symptoms. • Relief of discomfort can be accomplished most safely with nonprescription medication and/or spinal manipulation. • While some activity modification may be necessary during the acute phase, bed rest &gt;4 days is not helpful and may further debilitate the patient. • Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started in the first 2 weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation: exercises to condition trunk muscles are commonly delayed at least 2 weeks. • Patients recovering from acute low back problems are encouraged to return to work or their normal daily activities as soon as possible. • If low back symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated. • Patients with sciatica may recover more slowly, but further evaluation can also be safely delayed. • Within the first 3 months of low back symptoms, only patients with evidence of serious spinal pathology or severe, debilitating symptoms of sciatica, and physiologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise corroborated on imaging studies can be expected to benefit from surgery. • With or without surgery, 80 percent of patients with sciatica recover eventually. • Nonphysical factors (such as psychological or socio-economic problems) may be addressed in the context of discussing reasonable expectations for recovery.",

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization.

      "abstract": "Communications along the brain-gut axis involve neural pathways as well as immune and endocrine mechanisms.The two branches of the autonomic nervous system are integrated anatomically and functionally with visceral sensory pathways, and are responsible for the homeostatic regulation of gut function.The autonomic nervous system is also a major mediator of the visceral response to central influences such as psychological stress and other central factors.As presently defined, functional disorders represent a constellation of symptoms, some of which suggest the presence of altered perception while other symptoms point to disordered gastrointestinal function as the cause of the symptoms.2][3] While a number of diVerent methods were used to assess autonomic function, they generally point to decreased vagal (parasympathetic) outflow or increased sympathetic activity in conditions usually associated with slow or decreased gastrointestinal motility.Other studies found either increased cholinergic activity or decreased sympathetic activity in patients with symptoms compatible with increased motor activity. 3 4Under certain conditions, altered autonomic balance (including low vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity) may also alter visceral perception.Autonomic dysfunction could also represent the physiological pathway accounting for many of the extraintestinal symptoms seen in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, and for some of the frequent gastrointestinal complaints reported by patients with disorders such as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia.",

      "abstract": "Flurazepam, temazepam, and triazolam are compared in terms of initial and short term efficacy, effectiveness during intermediate and long term use, withdrawal effects, and general side effects. The usefulness of temazepam is considerably restricted since the drug is slowly absorbed; peak blood concentrations are not reached until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Consequently, while the majority of insomniac patients complain primarily of difficulty falling asleep, temazepam is not effective for this sleep complaint. Further, the drug has an intermediate elimination half-life and induces a significant degree of morning sleepiness (hangover). Rebound insomnia of a moderate degree occurs with some frequency following withdrawal of temazepam. Triazolam is effective initially and with short term use both for inducing and maintaining sleep. However, much of this effectiveness is lost with continued nightly use over an intermediate period (2 weeks). The drug has a rapid elimination rate; during drug administration, sleep may worsen in the final hours of the night (early morning insomnia), and following drug withdrawal, rebound insomnia is frequent, immediate, and severe. Side effects are frequent and include some morning sleepiness (before tolerance develops) and significant memory impairment and even episodes of amnesia. Triazolam may have a narrow margin of safety in that serious behavioral symptoms have been reported even with a 1-mg dose. Flurazepam is effective both for initiating and maintaining sleep with initial and short term drug administration. Further, its efficacy is maintained not only with intermediate term use but with long term drug use (4 weeks). Flurazepam is a long elimination half-life drug, and there is significant daytime sedation during short term use; with continued use this effect diminishes. Rebound insomnia has not been noted following withdrawal of flurazepam; there is a carry-over effectiveness into the first and second nights of withdrawal, and any withdrawal sleep disturbance would be expected to be infrequent, delayed in appearance, and mild in degree.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Options go beyond laxatives and include behavioural treatment as well as new drugs \n\nAlthough slow to emerge, major advances have occurred in understanding the causes and management of constipation. It now receives the attention deserved of a symptom that affects a quarter of the population at some time. Most important is the recognition that different pathophysiological processes can result in the final common symptoms of decreased bowel frequency or impaired rectal evacuation. Different clinical syndromes require different therapeutic approaches.\n\nBowel frequency is influenced by several factors including intake of dietary fibre, emotional make up, and psychological morbidity. Introspective individuals have a lower bowel frequency and produce less stool than extroverts. Infrequent bowel actions in the absence of symptoms can be regarded as part of the normal spectrum of bowel frequency. Low bowel frequency is more common in women.\n\nControlled cross sectional studies have shown that psychological morbidity is commonly associated with severe constipation.1 In some patients it is the key causative factor. Other factors include childhood problems such as sexual or physical abuse, loss of a parent through death or separation, or disturbed toileting behaviour. Underlying depression is another cause. For some the gut is their “outlet valve” for the normal stresses of living. The pathways between brain and gut that link emotions to bowel function have been largely characterised and shown to involve cerebral corticotrophin releasing factor and efferent autonomic pathways.

      "title": "Return of the Suppressed: Mental Control and Bulimia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "The clinical literature has long acknowledged the paradoxical findings that deliberate attempts to suppress particular thoughts actually increase their occurrence. The unwanted, intrusive thoughts that are a major feature of obsessive disorders, depression, sleep disorders, and a range of other disturbances are of particular clinical concern. The exploration of psychological factors associated with cognitive control is, therefore, clinically relevant. The present paper considers the role of mental control and thought suppression in bulimia nervosa in explaining the occurrence of unwanted thoughts and feelings, specifically in relation to weight, shape, and food. Our fundamental argument is that suppression of thoughts of food, weight, and body shape can lead to the increased frequency of these thoughts. The increase in unwanted thoughts is likely to result in a loss of control over eating, and lead to the escalation and perpetuation of bulimia. Dietary restriction is likely to be associated with successful suppression, and binge-eating with failed suppression. Indeed, the initial success of suppression paradoxically causes its inevitable failure. We conclude that the suppression of thoughts of food and weight or shape in bulimia nervosa is maladaptive and counterproductive. In addition, the therapeutic implications of thought suppression are considered.",

Such disturbances of sleep could be characterized by a dissociation of the daily sleep volume into some epoches which lasted not more than 5-6 hours each. The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced. This suggests that there might be an injury of nervous mechanisms responsible for the paradoxical sleep stage.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Women suffering from severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) show a typical behaviour pattern characterized by flight, avoidance, inactivity and helplessness. The question is if there is a common mechanism of origin in all those individual women who display such PD behaviour. A learning-theoretical model is presented concerning the origin of the connection between the stimulus of menstruation and the response of PD behaviour in women with severe PD: — Women have an increased physiological arousal premenstrually and during menstruation. — Women have a tendency to label the increased arousal negatively for two reasons: (1) Because of negative attitudes towards menstruation acquired from the social environment. (2) Because women have a lack of knowledge about their genitals and their functions, there is a lack of correct labelling of menstruation. Inexplicable arousal is mostly labelled as something “wrong”. — The negatively labelled increased arousal pre- and intermenstrually leads to an increased receptivity for conditioning. — The increased receptivity for conditioning means an increased proneness to react with a specific response to a certain stimulus, i. e. with PD behaviour as a response to the stimulus of menstruation. — Premenstrually highly anxious women are more receptive to conditioning than women who are not anxious premenstrually. The experience of PD makes the woman anticipate menstruation with anxiety, which thus forms the basis of a vicious circle. The validity of this theoretical model needs to be tested in experimental research.",

Overvaluation of body weight and shape and associated body dissatisfaction are core features of anorexia nervosa as well as bulimia nervosa. Patients' self‐evaluation is strongly dependent on how satisfied or unsatisfied they are with weight or shape. For the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, cognitive behavioral approaches focus on the distinctive features of the disorder: nutritional management and normalization of food intake; alteration of body image disturbances and negative feelings toward one's body; alteration of the functional relation of stress and eating behavior. Empirical evaluation confirms that psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. For bulimia nervosa, the therapeutic approach should be cognitive behavioral. For anorexia nervosa, the evidence of treatment effectiveness is rather scarce.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in the investigation of brain-gut interaction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were reviewed. Brain is suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS on the basis of the following evidence. (1) Stress often induces major symptoms of IBS patients (Drossman et al., 1982), simultaneously with colonic hypermotility (Fukudo et al., 1987) or dysmotility of the small intestine (Kumar et al., 1985). (2) IBS patients rarely express symptoms or small intestinal dysmotility during sleep (Kellow et al., 1990). (3) IBS patients complain of more pain with balloon distension of the colon or rectum than normal controls; visceral perception is enhanced in IBS (Whitehead et al., 1990). (4) IBS patients often show psychoneurotic symptoms and extra-colonic somatic symptoms (Young et al., 1976). (5) There are some animal (Williams et al, 1987) or human (Dinan et al, 1990) experiments which indicate the possible involvement of brain peptide or brain monoamine in IBS. (6) Dysrhythmia or increased beta power in electroencephalogram is observed more often in IBS patients than in the normal controls (Fukudo et al, 1991) in addition to abnormal REM sleep in IBS patients (Kumar et al., 1992). These observations support our hypothesis that not only the gut but also the brain show dysfunction and exaggerated responsivity to the stimuli in IBS. Further research on brain-gut interaction in IBS is warranted.",

The criteria for diagnosis of this pathology are the refusal to maintain a recommended weight, the intense fear of gaining weight, the disturbance in the perception of own body image and amenorrhea. There are two types of AN: the restrictive type and the purging/binge-eating type. Both lead to cardiac, pulmonary, bone and metabolism complications, among others, which are aggravated by the state of malnutrition of the patient. In AN, it is essential to conduct the refeeding of the patient along with a psychiatric treatment. This process aims to recover the weight and nutritional status. It is necessary to make early assessments of anthropometric, clinical, psychological and nutritional factors in order to identify any problems arising from the AN. It is also important to do a constant clinical and nutritional evaluation of the patient in order to avoid the refeeding syndrome. This syndrome is potentially lethal and it’s characterized by a disorder of electrolytes, minerals, vitamins and body fluids, when the refeeding is initiated. If detected early, this situation is reversible and the health care staff can proceed with the refeeding process.",

      "title": "Evidence and perspectives in eating disorders: a paradigm for a multidisciplinary approach",
      "abstract": "The WPA Section on Eating Disorders is primarily concerned with the prevention of these disorders, the assessment of their psychopathology and psychiatric and physical comorbidities, the identification of pathways to specialist care, the organization of integrated multidisciplinary approaches to their management, and the promotion of information on evidence-based treatments and strategies to support caregivers and to facilitate treatment adherence and effectiveness. Eating disorders are complex mental diseases growing on a psychopathological core, i.e. the overconcern with body weight and shape in determining self-esteem, as recently confirmed through network analyses1. This psychopathological core also includes maladaptive perfectionism, impulsive traits, dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, and social cognitive deficits, which lead to a number of abnormal behaviors ranging from extreme diet restriction to uncontrolled overeating with or without purging, vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse, as well as excessive exercising. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are the most well-known eating disorders, although other disorders have been included in the DSM-5. Eating disorder types differ in terms of lifetime prevalence and age at onset, but the peak age at onset of both threshold and subthreshold anorexia and bulimia nervosa occurs during adolescence. In this period, eating disorders are recognized as being the third most common chronic illness2. Moreover, they often co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, over the lifespan. Hence, they have a considerable impact on personal, family, working and social life. On the other hand, treatment may promote recovery in 40-50% of adult people and higher percentages of adolescents3. Eating disorders are marked by a high rate of physical comorbidity4, with anorexia nervosa reaching the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders. This highlights the need for multiple levels of treatment, including outpatient facilities as well as rehabilitation and hospital units, depending on the severity of the clinical picture. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach, which includes access to physical, nutritional, psychological and psychiatric interventions, is recommended in order to achieve full recovery5. Psychiatrists with adequate training and expertise are in the best position to build links with general practice, medical/emergency wards, mental health settings and specialist services. They play a key role in coordinating other clinicians in both diagnosis and treatment processes. Unfortunately, the current access rate to specialized services is unsatisfactory. Possible reasons for this are the complexity of the pathways to care and the patients' ambivalence towards change or denial of their illness, but also some deficiencies in the transition between adolescent and adult mental health care. The relevance of this issue is higher in eating disorders than in other mental diseases, as there is evidence that early intervention, i.e. in the first three years, yields more favorable outcomes6. Trained mental health professionals are essential in addressing these problems through the promotion of educational programs for health care practitioners, which may facilitate knowledge and identification of the disorders, and through support to patients in their therapeutic engagement. For the latter purpose, offering shared decision-making and creating supportive environments may be particularly effective. The application of evidence-based treatments for these disorders is a critical area that needs to be pursued7, but therapeutic alliance has been identified as a non-specific therapeutic factor that significantly contributes to promoting recovery8. The relevance of family involvement is unquestioned, especially in adolescents. Family members are important in identifying the disorder and facilitating access to specialist care, particularly in youth. Hence, it is essential that psychiatrists provide them with appropriate support and information, reducing the fear and stigma associated with eating disorders. Furthermore, there is a need to promote prevention programs such as school-based interventions and e-health projects, although the settings and the means of delivery need to be further explored. In accordance with the staging model of eating disorders6, the persistence of the illness is associated with neurofunctional changes (especially with respect to reward learning habits) and social exclusion, which may contribute to the disorder evolving into a severe and enduring stage. These processes, as well as variables such as body mass index, binge-purging behaviors, interpersonal functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, family problems and motivation to recovery, need to be taken into account by psychiatrists and specialized mental health professionals in order to tailor treatment to the individual patient9. Although treatment guidelines provide specific parameters to assess the level of medical risk and hospital admission requirements, psychiatrists are advised to consider the current definition of eating disorder severity still in development. The WPA Section on Eating Disorders was founded in 2002 and includes 172 members. It organizes symposia and section meetings at WPA conferences in order to provide a multidisciplinary discussion of the most relevant research topics and clinical advances in the field. It also promotes research activities aimed to assess differences among countries in pathways to specialist care, choice of specialist treatments and organization of inpatient and outpatient facilities. The Section aims to disseminate knowledge on the clinical management of eating disorders among psychiatrists as well as psychologists, other specialist physicians, general practitioners and nurses, highlighting the crucial role that psychiatrists must play in the multidisciplinary approach to these complex mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a universal concept; however, the experience is unique from person to person. Pain is a subjective term that an individual describes and experiences. Pain has its meaning and is produced out of the complex interactions of body, mind, and culture. Pain can be interpreted differently from individual to individual depending on the time and place where that person is [1]. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage [2]. Pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten. The patient's rate themselves. Usually, four to six is considered as a moderate level, and above seven is considered to be severe pain [3].",

      "title": "Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Northern India",
      "abstract": "Irritable syndrome (IBS) is a recurrent disorder characterised by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort (often bloating), in association with altered generation and interpretation of function, which is not accompanied by anatomical anomalies or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms tend to vary in manifestation and time course, worsen during flares, and affect patient's quality of life.1 A dysregulation of the brain-gut axis that interacts with visceral hypersensitivity and associated with observed digestive motor disturbances and micro-inflammation of the gut, with possibly an imbalance of the intestinal bio-flora. These are factors that may be responsible for the symptoms generation. Psychosocial stressors may then interact with biological factors and are modulated by cultural beliefs and practices resulting in variations on observed symptoms constellation and health seeking behaviours, a biopsychosocial disorder.\r\n\r\nA better outcome is achievable if a positive diagnosis of IBS is made, based on clinical symptoms (in the absence of alarm signs) alone, rather than making a diagnosis by exclusion. Several diagnostic exist and each new criterion refers to the insufficiencies of the previous ones. The most commonly accepted diagnostic include the original Manning and the subsequent series of foundation defined criteria. A formal definition according to the Rome III is recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month during the previous 3 months associated with two or more of the following with onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) symptoms improvement with defecation, (2) onset associated with a change in the frequency of stools and (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stools.1-4\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of IBS varies across the world, ranging from as high as 10%-20% in the West,5,6 to as low as 4.2% in India.7 There is a perception that IBS is less of a problem in Asia and its epidemiology to be different. In addition, the prevalence rates of IBS itself vary in Asia with higher rates being documented from more affluent urban communities of Japan, Singapore and Guangzhou in China.8-10 Prevalence rates also differ within the same country (Beijing 7.3% and Guangzhou 12%) and within the same racial community from different countries.8,11,12 Such observed differences may be due to the different (Manning vs Rome II vs Rome III) used to diagnose IBS or due to a different target population studied. However more recently, Park et al13 reported similar prevalence rates using Rome II (8%) and Rome III (9%) in a Korean IBS population.\r\n\r\nIn this study Makharia et al reported a prevalence rate of 4% which is in good agreement (4.2%) with a previous study by Ghoshal et al.7 This is interesting as the population involved in both studies were quite different. Ghoshal looked at subjects from mainly the hospital/clinic setting (recruitment centres from Northern, Central and Southern India) while the present study was solely community based (Northern India). Furthermore Makharia's group used a questionnaire based on the new Rome III module while Ghoshal's local criteria was more clinical and practical. Yet the resulting prevalence rates from both centers were quite similar. The observed prevalence rate is low compared to data from other Asian centers and also lower than the Western prevalence rates. We would expect lower prevalence rates from a rural community in Northern India, as IBS is recognized to be a disorder of developed nations and communities.8-10 However, Ghoshal's hospital based study confirmed that the prevalence rate is indeed low in India.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for the low prevalence rate could be from the use of different diagnostic tools or for the detection of a variable condition that is solely symptom based. One of the weaknesses of this study is that the used questionnaire was not validated for the study population. This might affect the quality of data acquired. However, a study from Nam et al14 using validated Rome III in Korea gave a prevalence rate of 8.2% which is still lower than the prevalence rates observed from communities in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nAnother unique observation is the much higher incidence of diarrhea predominant IBS (1.5%) compared to IBS constipation (0.3%). This was also reported from Ghoshal's study who also suggested that in general, Indians tend to pass 1-2 soft stool per day. This may be due to the higher fiber intake and faster gut transit time. Is it possible that another form of functional bowel or IBS exist in this sub-continent which is different from the West? Western patients tend to be more neurotic compared to the Asian patients who are more likely to be post infectious. This difference may also arise from other contributing factors such as race, different cultural practices, variation in food intake and co-existing lactose intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe other notable difference reported from this study is the increasing prevalence of IBS with advancing age, with the maximum in the 50-60 age groups. Across Asia, it has been noted that the prevalence of IBS is higher in the younger age group.8,9,11,12,15,16 In a rural community where the younger folks need to work hard for daily sustenance, symptoms of abdominal discomfort or alteration of pattern is often too trivial to be considered as abnormal enough to visit the hospital. The time of day in which the study was conducted in this native rural community of Northern India would also be important.\r\n\r\nThe often quoted male preponderance in Asian Indian IBS population was not demonstrated in this study. The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males. In the previous study by Ghoshal et al7 the subset of complainants in the study group showed a distinct predominance of male gender (68% vs 32%). The explanation given by the authors is that in a male dominant society, the health seeking behaviour of males can best account for the disparity in prevalence rates seen in the hospital/clinic setting compared to a rural community setting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study by Makharia et al is the first large scale IBS study in India using the Rome III criteria. However, this study has few limitations. Firstly, the diagnostic tool used, the Rome III questionnaire was not validated for this population. Secondly, it was also noted that the Glasgow pictorial stool chart was not used to determine stool forms. Even if patients can describe their stool forms adequately, pictorial definition is still the best method of evaluation since patient's perception is often very different from the actual stool form. Despite all of these, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology of IBS in India, by providing an alternative view point to the more accepted norms.",

      "abstract": "Connected Separateness or Separate Connection:Envisioning Body with Mind Nancy Kennedy, DrPH (bio) Consumers, including those who are poor and underserved, do not experience mental and physical health separately, although the dualism of the health care systems for primary care and mental health suggests that they do. Few consumers seeking health care services, whatever their socioeconomic circumstances, do so because they themselves recognize that they suffer from a mental disorder, a substance use disorder or even one of the ubiquitous problems of living that increase stress, anxiety and other negative feelings that give rise to deleterious behaviors (such as increased drug use, overeating, excessive shopping, inappropriate acts of violence). In contrast, lay people quite commonly self-diagnose and seek out health care services, motivated by physical discomfort or concerns about illness or by physical situations such as pregnancy; accidents and injuries; sexually transmitted diseases; headaches, stomach aches, and other assorted pains; and complications from diabetes, liver and kidney disease and hypertension. Approximately 37 million Americans 15 years old or older, or 15% of the population, have some sort of physical, mental, or emotional disability, making this one of the largest minorities in the country.1 (In fact 15% is probably lower than the actual percentage but it is the confirmable number given the paucity of the data and difficulties associated with epidemiological research.) An overwhelming 70% of the total U.S. population at some point in their lives will endure a condition lasting at least 6 months that interferes with activities of daily living, qualifying them as disabled.2 Unfortunately, our current health care system, in both its organization and financing, legitimizes the medicalization of these conditions, relegating problems associated with mental health to a lesser status. Meanwhile, the current U.S. health care system, having shifted its focus from infectious disease to chronic disease and behavioral disorders, engages in an unending discussion of how to integrate primary care and mental health, without emerging with significant changes to the medical model. [End Page 501] Providers, policymakers, and administrators, as well as consumers, must realize that the stigma associated with mental disorders, emotional problems, and even the normal sequellae to bereavement, physical relocation, marriage, divorce or separation, financial difficulties, weather-related disasters, and job loss is an impediment to positive outcomes including resiliency and wellness, self-care, and disease management for chronic conditions. In studies, conferences, and articles, health professionals implore the primary care and mental health systems to integrate rather than remaining separate. Federal efforts to promote these connections can be traced at least as far back as 1967, when community and migrant health centers were founded and to 1973, when federally qualified health maintenance organizations were first formed.3 Despite these efforts and the existence of some excellent models and programs where attention to body with mind is paramount, requests for integration continue to pour out, as is evident in the final report of President Bush's 2003 Commission on Mental Health.4 Significantly, the authors of that report note, \"Primary care providers may lack the necessary time, training, or resources to provide appropriate treatment for mental health problems. (page 21)\"4 Experts and practitioners in behavioral medicine and public health typically welcome the opportunity to integrate psychosocial with biomedical approaches to health and illness. Such opportunities arise during primary prevention encounters and the attendant attempts to change factors influencing health or well being, especially lifestyle and attitudes, beliefs, and moods that influence adaptation to stressors or illness. However, with the exception of behavioral medicine, a discipline whose intervention techniques ultimately are based on learning theory,5 few physicians or other primary care providers are interested in or profess to have the time to impart strategies to enhance mental health, prevent mental disorders or teach disease management techniques to treat mind with body. Health care is evolutionary. The emergence of managed care shifted the spotlight to primary care. In the early 1990s, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) appointed an expert Committee to assess the opportunities and challenges for primary care.6 One central characteristic of primary care is noted in the IOM report: \"Primary care does not consider mental health separately from physical health.

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

      "abstract": "Diabetic patients can be affected by a wide range of peripheral nerve disorders, the rarer of which are often poorly recognised and understood. “Insulin neuritis” or “treatment induced neuropathy” is a reversible disorder characterised by acute severe distal limb pain, peripheral nerve fibre damage and autonomic dysfunction, preceded by a period of rapid glycaemic control. The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of epilepsy is always a s0.urce of sh?ck to the family and is frequently accompamed by anXIety concerning the cause. In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution.

      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society.

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "abstract": "Three children presented with a complex syndrome of atypical psychotic and extremely immature behavior, obesity and overgrowth, borderline retardation, and seizures (prominent in two). Weight overgrowth exceeded height overgrowth and was stratospheric (up to 8 SD above mean). Obesity seemed related to lack of satiety. The cases fit no known condition: hypothalamic damage, Sotos' syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome were excluded. Empirical treatment with anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and acetazolamide) together with psychotropic agents (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risperidone) controlled seizures, improved behavior, and stopped weight gain in each patient. We have not found this syndrome previously described. The etiology is unknown: perinatal encephalopathy could be a factor in the two patients with prominent seizures; in the third, familial major affective disorder is implicated. Medication responses suggest a low-serotonin state underlying the lack of satiety, an imbalance of serotonin and noradrenergic modulation in the hypothalamus, and epileptogenic disorders (or affective disorder responsive to anticonvulsants in one case) involving these same systems.

Difficulties of this type can be associated with life-threatening consequences of other serious health-related problems. Because of the nature of these problems and the lack or accurate client self-reporting, an interdisciplinary assessment in addition to a thorough behavioral assessment is recommended to ensure the best quality of care.

Individuals with AN tend to experience reduced sensitivity to reward and increased sensitivity to punishment. Altered sensitivity to reward and punishment is observed in those with AN, for both food and general rewards/losses and thus suggests a broader deficit in reward processing. Hunger does not increase reward sensitivity in AN, suggesting a deficit in translating physiological signals to motivated behavior, and explaining why individuals with AN can restrict food despite starvation. Altered reward processing may be why we see low motivation for recovery and anhedonia. Decreased brain response to reward in the cognitive circuitry in AN is associated with elevated anxiety, suggesting a brain basis for coding food as risky.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder noted for its unique intensity of vomiting, repeated emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed due to the unappreciated pattern of recurrence and lack of confirmatory testing. Because no accepted approach to management has been established, the task force was charged to develop a report on diagnosis and treatment of CVS based upon a review of the medical literature and expert opinion. The key issues addressed were the diagnostic criteria, the appropriate evaluation, the prophylactic therapy, and the therapy of acute attacks. The recommended diagnostic approach is to avoid \"shotgun\" testing and instead to use a strategy of targeted testing that varies with the presence of 4 red flags: abdominal signs (eg, bilious vomiting, tenderness), triggering events (eg, fasting, high protein meal), abnormal neurological examination (eg, altered mental status, papilledema), and progressive worsening or a changing pattern of vomiting episodes. Therapeutic recommendations include lifestyle changes, prophylactic therapy (eg, cyproheptadine in children 5 years or younger and amitriptyline for those older than 5), and acute therapy (eg, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists, termed triptans herein, as abortive therapy, and 10% dextrose and ondansetron for those requiring intravenous hydration). This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition for the diagnosis and treatment of CVS in children and adolescents.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.",

Anorexia nervosa has a considerably worse long-term outcome than bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorders. Never the less, purging bulimia nervosa is often associated with other impulsive symptoms, such as addictions and suicide attempts. Chronic undernutrition leads to main long-term medical complications of eating disorders: linear growth in adolescents with anorexia nervosa, infertility, and osteoporosis. These complications need a specific medical follow up, at least once a year, added to the psychiatric and psychotherapist follow-up.",

They often induce a distress in the family, an individual sadness possibly leaving at time to maltreatment. In the normal infant or the medically fragile infant due to prematurity or an acute episode, complaints from the patient or family sources force the medical team to find an explanation or a treatment, which are not always adequate. In other conditions such as asthma, obesity, anorexia nervosa, autism, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, the sleeping disorders may be so unnoticed or remain insufficiently investigated. Globally, in this domain, the clinical description is often imprecise and sleep studies underused.

Vomiting or diuretic/laxative abuse result in weakness and fatigue, probably by hypokalemia, volume contraction, and other mechanisms. Significant hypophospahatemia should also now be considered as a cause of the weakness and fatigue in anorexia nervosa but has not previously been reported in pure restricting anorexia nervosa. Hypophosphatemia not only may mimic symptoms seen with anorexia nervosa, but if chronic can cause osteomalacia, pertinent for anorexics already at high risk for premature osteoporosis. We report one patient with symptomatic hypophosphatemia during starvation in anorexia nervosa who improved with repletion of phosphate and two others retrospectively noted to be hypophosphatemic. No etiology, other than starvation, was detected. Serum phosphorus should be measured in all patients with anorexia nervosa. Symptoms should not merely be attributed to depression or hypokalemia.",

      "title": "How once-nightly sodium oxybate is processed in the body in healthy volunteers: a plain language summary",
      "abstract": "What is this summary about? This is a plain language summary of an article originally published in the journal Sleep Medicine. Narcolepsy is a sleep condition in which people have periods of extreme sleepiness during the day. People with narcolepsy may also have symptoms of muscle weakness (cataplexy); seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that seems real but isn't actually there before falling asleep or while waking up (hallucinations); an inability to move before falling asleep or while waking up (sleep paralysis); and poor sleep at night. Sodium oxybate (SXB for short) has been used to treat narcolepsy for over 20 years. For more than 20 years, the only available form of SXB needed to be taken twice each night. Twice-nightly SXB (TN-SXB) requires people to take the first dose at bedtime. Most people fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. Patients then need to wake up and take the second dose of TN-SXB 2.5 to 4 hours later, which is when most of the medicine has left the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) approved a once-nightly form of SXB called LUMRYZ ™ (sodium oxybate for extended-release oral suspension; ON-SXB for short) in May 2023. ON-SXB treats excessive daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness, also known as cataplexy. People with narcolepsy who take ON-SXB only need to take 1 dose at bedtime. This summary describes a study that looked at how ON-SXB enters, travels through, and exits the body of healthy volunteers (people without narcolepsy). The study measured the amount of SXB in the blood after taking SXB in 2 different ways: as a once-nightly version and as a twice-nightly version. Looking at the amount of ON-SXB and TN-SXB in the blood at different time points helps researchers see if people who take the 2 medicines, with different dosing, have the same amount of drug in the body overnight. What were the results? Overall, the study found that healthy volunteers had the same amount of SXB in their bodies after taking ON-SXB as they did after taking TN-SXB. When they took the same amounts of ON-SXB and TN-SXB, the SXB stayed in their bodies for similar amounts of time. The highest amount and the total amount of SXB in the participants' blood were similar with ON-SXB and TN-SXB. The amount of SXB in the participants' blood 8 hours after taking the medicine was significantly lower with ON-SXB than with TN-SXB. This means that people taking ON-SXB will have less medication in their blood when they wake up the next morning and may be less groggy. What do the results mean? The results mean that if people with narcolepsy take the same dose amount of ON-SXB or TN-SXB, their bodies will receive the same amount of SXB in their blood. ON-SXB provides an option for people with narcolepsy to take their medicine once at bedtime without the need for a middle-of-the-night dose, which can improve quality of life.",

Psychotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment and often has been unsuccessful. The similarity of bulimia to major depression has led to evaluation of antidepressant drugs for treatment of the disease. Imipramine has proven effective in reducing binging episodes, and further evaluation of antidepressants seems warranted. Phenytoin also has been effective in some cases, suggesting that bulimia may be a neurologic disorder analogous to epilepsy. Optimal treatment may be antidepressants combined with a nutrition/psychotherapy program.",

In addition, there can be specific challenges for those with eating disorders due to the specific cognitive difficulties they present. These include a lack of flexibility and difficulty in terms of seeing the ‘bigger picture’ when faced with a particular issue. Those patients with anorexia and strongly obsessional disorders can find ‘set shifting’ particularly difficult – that is, when the ‘rules’ change, they struggle to shift to the new rules instead of the old ones. It is hard for them to learn new adaptive skills or mobilise and generalise learned adaptive skills to a new situation. Their capacity to adapt is further impaired by starvation and low weight, which exacerbates rigidity of thinking.",

It is defined by the presence of headache on 15 or more days a month, of which at least eight must meet the criteria of migraine without aura for a minimum of three months. In addition they must not be due to medication abuse or attributable to any other cause.The prevalence of chronic migraine ranges between 1-3% of the population and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. It produces from four to six times more disability, decreased productivity and disruption of quality of life than episodic migraine. The development of chronic migraine has been associated with both non-modifiable risk factors (being female, low socio-economic status and level of schooling) and modifiable risk factors (anxiety, depression, sleep apnoea/snoring, obesity, consumption of painkillers and caffeine). Patients with chronic migraine suffer from chronic pain, anxiety or depression two to three times more often than those with episodic migraine. Management requires identification and control of the risk factors that predispose patients to develop the condition, detoxification therapy in the event of abuse of analgesics, specific treatment for migraine attacks and preventive treatment. The effectiveness of the preventive drugs topiramate and Onabotulinumtoxin A in this complication of migraine has been proved in large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials.Chronic migraine is a common condition that requires global management aimed at reducing the frequency of the attacks, lowering the associated disability and improving the patients' quality of life.",

On the one hand, it has been shown that seizures in epilepsy may sometimes be precipitated by procedures which induce alkalosis, such as the administration of bicarbonate or by voluntary hyperpnea, and that tetany is accompanied by a condition of alkalosis. On the other hand, epileptic seizures may often be suppressed by procedures that induce acidosis, such as fasting, the use of a fat diet, the ingestion of acids or acid-forming salts, and breathing of a mixture rich in carbon dioxide. The last mentioned procedure may also be effective in relieving muscle spasm and hiccup. These various observations raise the question whether persons who are subject to seizures present any abnormality in the acid-base relations of the body. Many",

      "abstract": "Several studies over the years have demonstrated that sleep complaints in general, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in particular, tend to be more prevalent among women. The 2007 Sleep in America poll of women age 40–60 years old found that 20% reported sleepiness that interfered with daily life (Chasens et al., Behav Sleep Med 8(3):157–71, 2010). This chapter discusses EDS due to primary sleep disorders other than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) including Narcolepsy, Recurrent Hypersomnia, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Behaviorally Induced Insufficient Sleep Syndrome as well as Hypersomnia Due to Medical condition and Hypersomnia Due to Drug or Substance. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations. Recurrent hypersomnia is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia often associated with other symptoms that typically last weeks or months apart. Episodes usually last a few days to several weeks and appear one to ten times a year. Sleep and general behavior must be normal between episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) and Menstrual-related hypersomnia are two distinct clinical subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by constant and severe excessive sleepiness. Naps are typically unrefreshing and post-awakening confusion (sleep drunkenness) is often reported. EDS is a very prevalent problem in developed societies. Women tend to complain more of EDS than men. This prevalence may partially be due to greater sleep deprivation, hormonal factors, and the higher incidence of some primary and secondary sleep disorders in women.",

Case report We describe a patient with a longstanding episodic cluster headache who experienced, on two occasions, a period of nocturnal awakenings without pain or autonomic symptoms, lasting one week before the onset of a cluster bout. Awakenings occurred twice/night at the same hours of impending cluster attacks and had no apparent trigger, being unusual for this patient who had no previous sleep disturbances. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal. Discussion This case documents two new aspects of cluster headache. It suggests that repeated nocturnal awakenings can be a warning sign of an impending cluster period, a finding that may have therapeutic implications, and also that hypothalamic activation may begin several days before trigemino-autonomic symptoms, thus behaving as a true bout generator.",

      "abstract": "Several Classical Ayurvedic texts describe Amlapitta, a common gastrointestinal system illness of Annavaha Srotasa. Amlapitta has been mentioned in several Ayurvedic writings since the time of the Samhita. Textbooks including the Kashyapa Samhita, Yoga Ratnakara, and Bhaishajya Ratnavali give detailed descriptions of this situation. Amlapitta is classified as a predominant sickness, or Pitta Pradhana Vyadhi. Amla pitta is character-ised by indigestion (Avipaka), a burning feeling in the throat and heart (Hritkantha Daha), sour and bitter belch-ing (tikta-amlodgara), gurgling sounds in the intestines (Antra Kujana), chest pain, and diarrhoea. The Vata Pitta Dosha is vitiated by overindulging in etiological elements, such as unhealthy lifestyles. When Pitta, Vata, or Kapha cooperate, the Jatharagni factor, which controls digestion, or Jatharagnimandya (diminu-tion of digestion), is weakened. Undigested food, or Vidagdha, is consumed during this stage. It eventually be-comes Shukta (acidified) and stays in the stomach for a long time. At this point, the premonitory sign of Am-lapitta sickness, indigestion from acidified chyle, or Vidagdhajirna, appears. Furthermore, Pitta Amavisha Sammurchana, a mixture of undigested food and unmetabolised Rasa, is the out-come of vitiated Pitta and Shukta. We call this condition Amlapitta.",

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies.

      "abstract": "After bilateral circumscribed lesions in the region of the dorsomedial and anterior thalamic nuclei, transitory confusion for time (chronotaraxis), frequently alone and sometimes combined with disorientation for place, was found. As a rule this disturbance lasted only a few days or weeks, but in one case half a year. The patients were confused regarding date, season of the year, and time of day. They misstated their age and that of their children. There was, in some instances, a tendency to overestimate, in others to underestimate, duration of time, such as the patient's stay in hospital or in his home. Usually the disturbances were associated with memory defects affecting recent as well as remote events. A combination with anosognosia or emotional changes occurred in some instances only. Sometimes, there was a discrepancy between the patient's feeling as to the passage of time and his judgment of it as obtained by intellectual processes. These latter observations seem to support the view that isolated disturbances of the immediate perception of duration do exist. Various circuits participate in the mechanism of temporal orientation, particularly connections of the dorsomedial nuclei with the frontal lobe and of the anterior nuclei with the mammillary body, and perhaps of the lateral nuclei with the parietal lobe. The significance of the connections of the anterior nuclei with the gyrus cinguli and of the intralaminar nuclei is doubtful. The multiplicity of the participating circuits explains that circumscribed lesions of single thalamic nuclei produce only transitory temporal disturbances.",

While there is a higher rate of obesity in populations with binge eating disorder (BED) and night eating syndrome (NES), the majority of people whose weights are classified as obese do not regularly engage in binge or night-eating behavior, and this ED model does not seem to apply for this population who are not overeating in response to aversive stimuli.

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of A Cognitive Behavior Programme In Reducing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder among College Students",
      "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is considered among the most painful psychological disorders. It is characterized by a number of obsessive compulsive thoughts that come ruminatively over the mind of the individual in such an unavoidable way that it would be hard to get rid of them, even though there are frequent attempts on the part of the individual to resist those thoughts. In fact, the individual does realize how trivial, irrational and illogical such thoughts are. Examples of them are thinking of God, Universe, and importance of the individual; plus fears from microbes, diseases, and so forth. Even worse, they could be a reason for the individual’s obsession, which in turn leads to the neglect of the individual’s daily practical interests. Also, the OCD is characterized by a number of acts, rituals, and motor impulses made frequently on a regular basis. Those accompanying characteristics, however insignificant and petty, take the form of a lofty desire. The following are among the most frequent and common compulsive acts and rituals: Washing the hands over hundreds of times unnecessarily, washing the body after excretion or in the course of menstruation, non-accompanying the others, holing everything with paper in fear of contamination, etc. Even so, these compulsive acts and rituals could not be done, while only the obsessive thoughts continue.\r\n\r\n\tProblem of Study\r\nThe OCD causes a whole lot of trouble to the individual or the university student; it leads to a down-beat state, a waste of time and effort, and substantial intervention into the most straightforward every-day activities. This, in its entirety, could result in scholastic achievement and retardation in the process of learning; even, perhaps, this could bring about the dropping out of education for the frequent failure; not to mention, the deterioration of social activities and family relations, and relations with others. Hence the need for a program, resting on the cognitive-behavioral technical therapy, for alleviating the COD.\r\n\r\n\tThe Study Problem consists in tackling the following queries:\r\n\r\n1-\tHow far is the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral program in alleviating the OCD for a sample of university students?\r\n2-\tHow far is the continuing effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in alleviating the OCD after the follow-up period?\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSignificance of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tTreating the OCD through a program that rests on cognitive-behavioral technical therapy.\r\n2-\tScarcity of Arab studies, to the researcher’s knowledge, that handled the therapy of the OCD, particularly the cognitive-behavioral therapy.\r\n3-\tAvoiding the use of other therapeutic techniques, especially the medicinal therapy with its bad side-effects on the disordered person; and, also, avoiding the psyco-analytic therapy which may demand great effort and time, not to mention skepticism about its results.\r\n4-\tTreating the OCD enables the individual, particularly, university students, to save time and effort and to rid themselves of being downbeat; it also aids them in enhancing the social relations, which were once deteriorating on account of the OCD.\r\n5-\tAlleviating the suffering from the OCD results in a better mental hygiene on the individual’s part and getting rid of a lot of the accompanying disorders.\r\n\r\n\tAims of the Study\r\n \r\nThe present study aims at alleviating the OCD for a sample of students at the Faculty of Education via testing the effectiveness of a program that rests on the technicality of a cognitive-behavioral therapy and the continuity of the effectiveness of such a program on the experimental group after the follow-up period. \r\n\r\nTerms of Study\r\na-\tObsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\r\nb-\tCognitive-behavioral Therapy \r\n\r\n\r\n\tHypotheses of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two groups (experimental-static) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the experimental group after applying the program.\r\n2-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the experimental group for the two measurements (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the post-scale.\r\n3-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n4-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two groups (experimental-static) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the experimental group after the follow-up period.\r\n5-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the experimental group of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n6-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the static group of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSample of Study \r\na-\tExploratory Study Sample:\r\nThe tools of diagnosis have been applied to a large sample of university students totaling around (316) from the 2nd and 3rd year students (scientific as well as literary Departments) of Faculty of Education, Kafr El-Sheikh University; they are divided into 90 males and 216 females with a view to obtaining the exploratory study sample reaching 3 students (one male student and two female students) of the 2nd year, as a means of verifying the validity of the program.\r\nb-\tBasic Study Sample: \r\nIt is composed of 10 students (males and females), with an age that ranges from 19 to 23 years, who are suffering from the OCD.\r\nThey are divided into two groups:\r\n1-\tExperimental with 5 (2 male students and 3 female students)\r\n2-\tStatic with 5 (2 male students and 3 female students)\r\n\r\n\tFindings of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tThe effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on alleviating the acuteness of the OCD afflicting university students.\r\n2-\tThe effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on modifying the negative and irrational ideas relevant to the OCD\r\n3-\tThe continuity of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on alleviating the acuteness for the experimental group over the follow-up period that reaches about 3 months. \r\n\r\n\t The recommendations of the study\r\n\r\nIn the light of the results of the present study, the study recommends the following : \r\n\r\n1-\tTraining parents not to support obsessive ideas and actions,and compulsive movement rituals in children , which are acause of suffering from obsessive –compulsive disorder.\r\n2-\t 2-training university students on cognitive programs or , through school curricule , on scientific and critical thinking , that help to get rid of irrational and negative thoughts , which are acause of suffering from psychological disorders .\r\n3-\tincreasing the family awareness through not supporting negative and irrational thoughts , especially those which are related to obsessive – compulsive disorder through specialized counseling programs.\r\n4-\t Setting up specialized contres of cognitive behavior therapy for psychological disorder in particular .\r\n5-\tincreasing the individuals' awareness through mass madia concerning the necessity of asking for psychological consultation when suffering from any psychological disorder , especially obsessive – compulsive disorder so that the problem may not increase .\r\n6-\tthe necessity that apsychologist must be inside colleges to present psychological consultation for students , especially in colleges for non- specialists",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome following introduction of venlafaxine following withdrawal of phenelzine: implications for drug washout periods",
      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "abstract": "Despite the extensive impact of autonomic function on the gastrointestinal system, there is little understanding of the mechanisms by which specific autonomic abnormalities translate into particular gastrointestinal complaints. Three logical alternatives include: (1) the underlying disorder affects the autonomic and gastrointestinal systems independently; (2) autonomic dysfunction alters gastrointestinal processing directly; (3) gastrointestinal manifestations arise as a delayed, indirect consequence of autonomic dysfunction. The major gastrointestinal manifestations of dysautonomia include esophageal dysmotility such as achalasia, gastroparesis, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in the upper tract. Lower tract disorders include diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and constipation. Sorting through the varied causes of these disorders requires a careful history and examination in each patient. Supportive diagnostic studies may include radionuclide imaging, motility examination, and electrogastrography. Autonomic studies can (1) distinguish a purely enteric from a more generalized dysautonomia; (2) provide surrogate information about motility; (3) differentiate primary (e.g., multiple system atrophy) from secondary (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) dysautonomias as the etiology of gastrointestinal symptoms. Several new strategies are available for the treatment of gastroparesis, constipation, irritable bowel, and sphincteric incontinence.",

      "title": "The importance of measuring impulsiveness in patients with addiction problems",
      "abstract": "An impulse may be sudden, or it may be a steady rise in tension until it reaches a climax, whereupon it is acted out without regard to self or others. Impulsivity is actually evidenced behaviorally as carelessness, an underestimated sense of harm, extroversion, impatience, including the inability to delay gratification, and a tendency toward risk-taking, pleasure, and sensation seeking. Impulsivity has been defined as the failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation that is potentially harmful to oneself or others, and is a defining characteristic of a wide spectrum of psychiatric diseases, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar spectrum disorders, impulse control disorders, cluster B personality disorders, and addiction. Three cognitive components play an important role in modulating impulsivity: inability to delay gratification, distractibility, and disinhibition.1 In contrast to compulsivity, which is driven by an effort to reduce anxiety, impulsivity is driven by an effort to obtain arousal and gratification. However, individuals with both behavior problems have in common the inability to refrain from repetitive behaviors. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder, characterized by a cycle of intoxication, binging, withdrawal, and craving, which results in excessive drug use despite adverse consequences. Drugs that have the potential for abuse and addiction increase dopamine (DA) levels in the reward circuit, and this characteristic is believed to underlie their reward effects. Previous clinical studies of addiction have focused on the midbrain DA-rich areas and the basal ganglia structures, which are involved in reward and conditioning. Recent clinical studies, however, have focused on the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in addiction. Disrupted PFC function contributes to impulsivity, compulsivity, risk-taking, and impaired self-monitoring in addicts, and leads to a syndrome of impaired response inhibition and salience attribution, characterized by attributing excessive salience to the drug, drug cues, decreased sensitivity to nondrug rewards, and decreased ability to inhibit maladaptive or risky behaviors. As a result, addicts tend to compulsively and impulsively seek and use the drug, lose the ability to limit intake, and suffer from a negative emotional state when access to the drug is prevented. As the addiction progresses, there is a shift from positive reinforcement driving the motivated behavior to negative reinforcement driving the motivated behavior (from liking to wanting). Thus, drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder which progresses from impulsivity to compulsivity. In addition, results from both human and animal studies have confirmed the association between addiction and impulsivity using different techniques.2 Impulsivity, expressed as impulsive decision-making and inhibitory failure to stop, plays an important role during different phases of addiction. In the beginning, impulsivity leads to drug abuse, which in turn increases impulsivity, contributing to risky, disinhibiting behaviors.3,4 Furthermore, chronic use of drugs of abuse lowers D2 DA receptor (DRD2) levels, and thus impairs PFC control of impulsivity. Animal studies first explored the connection between DRD2 and behavioral control, and the results of such studies clearly show a negative correlation between DRD2 and impulsivity, as well as a negative correlation between impulsivity and drug self-administration.5,6 In human cases with addiction problems, lower striatal DRD2 levels significantly correlated with lower brain glucose metabolism in key regions of the PFC, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (involved with salience attribution) and cingulate gyrus (involved with inhibitory control), disruption of which results in compulsivity and impulsivity.7,8 An association was also found between reduced baseline PFC and reduced striatal DRD2 levels in cases with addiction problems. This finding evinces the strong connections between neuroadaptations in PFC pathways and downstream dysfunctions in the DA reward and motivational systems, likely because of the influence of PFC on impulsivity.9 As for another important phase of addiction, craving, there are individual differences in the degree of cue-elicited craving. Impulsivity is again found to be one of the important personal factors. Individuals with higher impulsivity appeared to show ineffective response inhibition and more craving for substance-related cues.10 Another recent study, however, suggested a need to explore individual differences in compulsivity when addressing the links between craving and impulsivity in patients with opiate dependence, because the results of this study revealed that individual differences in compulsivity mediated the association between craving and inhibitory control in Stroop performance.11 Different deficits of impulse control may perhaps motivate drug use in a variety of ways. At present, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11) is one of the most commonly used measures to evaluate the symptoms of impulsivity and aggressions.12 The BIS-11 measures impulsivity in terms of three domains: motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness, and attentional impulsiveness. By evaluating a patient's severity in each of the three domains, the scale is able to provide a description of impulsivity in individuals. It is a clinician-rated scale, and requires 10–15 minutes to complete the 30 items. It is easy to administer and widely used. As a variety of findings in the literature related to alcohol and stimulants have used the BIS-11 measures to examine the role of impulsivity in addiction,13 a study to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of BIS-11 in abstinent, opioid-dependent cases has been carried out.14 The report may help clinicians in Taiwan to detect individuals with a high risk of developing addiction problems, and to measure treatment retention and the possibility of relapse objectively.

In the majority of patients evaluated, no clear cause of symptoms can be identified, and the condition is termed functional or nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). The pathophysiology of NUD remains unclear, but disturbances in gastrointestinal motility or sensation are often found. Clinically, NUD can be subdivided into dysmotility-like (in which discomfort, fullness, bloating, early satiety, or nausea [but not pain] predominate) or ulcer-like (in which epigastric pain is predominant). In ulcer-like NUD, antisecretory therapy is useful, but in dysmotility-like NUD, acid suppression is not superior to placebo. Cisapride accelerates gastric emptying and enhances gastric accommodation but probably does not blunt perception. Although cisapride relieves symptoms of dyspepsia without the adverse central nervous system effects often associated with metoclopramide, its cardiac toxicity has led to disuse. Antidepressants are of uncertain efficacy but are widely used. New prokinetics and other enteric neuromodulating agents are being tested in NUD and are likely to find an important place in clinical practice in the future.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Refeeding problems in a severe Anorexia Nervosa case",
      "abstract": "Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder of puberty or adolescence. It is characterized by self-induced weight loss; various psychological disturbances including distorted body image, fear of obesity, active pursuit of thinness and loss of recognition of a number of body enteroreceptive sensations; and secondary physiological abnormalities. The treatment of AN includes individual psychotherapy, family therapy, and nutritional rehabilitation. Hospital treatment is required when the patient's medical condition is in danger due to hypovolemia or hypotension. If cardiac arrhythmias occur without electrolyte disturbances or if oral therapy fails, nutrition should be repleted by the safest method available. This can be done by nasogastric tube or intravenous hyperalimentation. The management of AN is challenging, because the treatment process and anticipated outcome is in direct conflict with the sufferer's own wishes. A comprehensive treatment plan including both psychiatric and medical approaches is necessary. We report a severe AN case, who has refeeding problems after a three months' hospitalisation period. She was admitted to the child intensive care unit due to deterioration of her vital signs. We tried to solve her problems as a team, and believe that AN has a number of crucial problems thus requiring a multi-faceted treatment approach.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "title": "Assessment and management of seizures in the critically ill",
      "abstract": "Abstract In previously conscious patients seizures are usually easily detected. Critically-ill patients are frequently sedated and a proportion are paralysed with neuromuscular blocking agents, in such patients it may be hard or impossible to detect seizures clinically. An urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained whenever seizures are witness or suspected, especially if the patient does not rapidly return to baseline, when non-convulsive status epilepticus must be excluded. Unless the cause of the seizure activity is already known, an urgent CT, or MRI is indicated. If central nervous system infection is suspected a lumbar puncture may be needed. Status epilepticus is diagnosed when there is recurrent or continued seizure activity without intervening recovery. Most seizures are self-limiting and stop after 1–2 minutes, seizures that continue for more than 5 minutes should be treated. Treatment priorities for any seizure are to stop the patient hurting either themselves or anyone else. General supportive measures include attention to the airway, breathing, circulation, exclusion of hypoglycaemia and an EEG to exclude non-convulsive status epilepticus. A variety of drugs can be used to terminate seizures; parenteral benzodiazepines are the most commonly used agents although propofol and barbiturates are alternatives. Emergent endotracheal intubation may well be necessary, hypotension can be expected and may need treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors.",

Diperlukan waktu 6-8 jam perhari agar mendapatkan kualitas tidur yang baik. Insomnia merupakan persepsi atau keluhan atas kualitas tidur yang buruk ditandai dengan kesulitan memulai tidur, mempertahankan tidur, dan terbangun terlalu dini di pagi hari yang dapat menyebabkan kelelahan, kecemasan, kurang konsentrasi, hingga depresi yang dapat mengganggu aktifitas harian. \r\nData prevalensi insomnia sangat beragam di indonesia 10% dari total penduduk mengalami gangguan sulit tidur atau insomnia dan 15% diantaranya adalah kasus insomnia kronis. Insomnia sendiri diklasifikasikan ke beberapa hal. Berdasarkan waktu insomnia terbagi menjadi insomnia transien, insomnia jangka pendek, dan insomnia kronis, sedangkan berdasarkan etiologinya insomnia dibedakan menjadi insomnia primer dan insomnia sekunder.\r\nDalam TCM insomnia dapat diakibatkan karena defisiensi Qi jantung dan kandung empedu yang bisa diakibatkan karena pola hidup yang kurang baik, terlalu lama menderita penyakit, atau mengkonsumsi obat terlalu sering sehingga dapat menguras Qi dan darah. Penanganan insomnia dapat dilakukan menggunakan terapi kombinasi pijat swedia, tuina dan nutrisi olahan daun kelor. Pemberian pijat kombinasi adalah untuk memberikan efek relaksasi dan memanipulasi langsung kedalam titik akupuntur sedangkan pemberian nutrisi olahan daun kelor sebagai asupan tambahan sehingga insomnia dapat berkurang. Terapi pijat dilakukan menggunakan teknik swedia pada seluruh tubuh dan teknik tuina pada beberapa titik akupuntur seperti Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Pishu (BL20), Weishu (BL21), Shenshu (BL23), Fengchi (GB20), Jianjing (GB 21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Shenting (GV24), Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), dan Sibai (ST2) yang dilakukan 21 kali terapi.

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

Different neurologic diseases may produce a disturbance in central control of gut motility, resulting in gastrointestinal syndromes such as vomiting or intestinal pseudo-obstruction with or without gastric stasis. There are no accepted treatment guidelines. The pharmacologic treatment of nausea and vomiting usually involves established drugs chosen and rotated as necessary on a trial basis.

These disorders have not been officially recognized so that they are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides, pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration. This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants to improve his/her health, treat a disease or lose weight. Finally, the diet becomes the most important part of their lives. We present a clinical case that responds to the characteristics of orthorexia. The differential diagnosis with chronic delusional disorder, anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder is carried out.",

Depending upon the sign of dominating effects, disordered active attention was accompanied either by acceleration and lability, or by delayed and inert psychic processes. This leads to an increasing disturbances in the organization of all forms of intellectual activity, up to a total inhibition of active psychic reflection at the clinical phase of the attack.

      "abstract": "A 32-year-old woman with no prior medical conditions, but a history of anorexia nervosa (AN) diagnosed in adolescence, was referred for evaluation by an eating disorders (ED) specialist due to worsening bingeing and purging behaviors. Her clinical presentation was characterized by a body mass index (BMI) approaching the underweight range and frequent bingeing and purging episodes occurring twice daily, consistent with a diagnosis of BN. No other medical or psychiatric comorbidities were diagnosed, including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, which are often comorbid with ED. However, the patient reported significant difficulties in managing both personal and professional activities, attributing these challenges to impaired concentration. She had difficulty staying focused on tasks and was easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or stimuli. As a result, she often procrastinated on household and self-care tasks. She also reported problems with time management, frequently arriving late to work, struggling to complete assignments on time, and underestimating how long tasks would take. Initial treatment with fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) yielded no substantial improvement. Given the presence of symptoms suggestive of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a one-month trial of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was initiated. This intervention resulted in a marked reduction in bingeing and purging episodes and a notable improvement in the patient's concentration, thereby enhancing her overall quality of life. The importance of ADHD screening is underscored, particularly for high-functioning adult women who may not present typical symptoms. In this case, a thorough clinical assessment and detailed anamnesis raised suspicion of previously unrecognized ADHD, that may have been present since childhood. Although the literature on the comorbidity of ADHD and BN is limited, this case highlights a potential link between the two conditions. The significant improvement observed following the introduction of psychostimulants supports the hypothesis that untreated ADHD may contribute to the exacerbation of BN symptoms. Further research is essential to clarify the underlying mechanisms and establish a solid scientific basis for future clinical interventions and therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Stress plays a crucial role in coping with extrinsic insults through modulating the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. The allostatic model of maintaining \"stability through change\" allows the body to respond to a challenge by adjusting to a new steady-state and terminating it once the danger has passed. However, unrelenting stress can lead to decompensation with development of pathologic illness. With sufficient activation the response may become more damaging than the stressor itself. Two types of \"allostatic overload\" are described: type 1 is an essentially protective response triggered by changes in environment, food supply, or physiologic status where energy demand exceeds supply. The response aims to reduce this imbalance by modifying behavior and intrinsic body systems to direct the animal into a survival mode. Type 2 overload occurs when there is sufficient or excess energy consumption; however, this situation does not trigger an escape or survival response. A clear analogy may be made to critical care where excess stress affects metabolic, hormonal, and immunoinflammatory responses and contributes to the development of organ failure. Ongoing stress also compromises recovery so it is incumbent upon caregivers to reduce stress, be it induced by tissue hypoxia, catecholamine infusion, sleep deprivation, pain, anxiety, and/or excess noise.",

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is an uncommon but life threatening psychiatric disorder that is characterized by persistent energy intake restriction associated with intense fear of gaining weight and disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The nutritional compromise associated with anorexia nervosa affects most major organ systems, including the brain. To present and discuss the case of a patient with restricting-type anorexia nervosa who presents brain cortical atrophy. interview with the patient, analysis of patient's clinical file (including neuroimaging studies) and literature review on brain changes, especially focused on cortical atrophy, in restricting-type anorexia nervosa patients using the Pubmed/Medline databases. a 21 year-old female patient, with diagnosis of severe restricting-type anorexia (BMI < 15 Kg/m2), hospitalized for severe low body weight without any signs or symptoms besides memory complaints. The neurological exam was normal. Brain CT scan revealed generalized brain cortical atrophy. In anorexia nervosa, long-term persistent energy intake restriction is associated with brain volume changes, particularly global gray matter reduction which can be reversed by normal eating and associated weight gain. Although most cases of brain cortical atrophy are reversible, some will still persist despite normal eating. This report presents a challenging patient with restricting-type anorexia nervosa with brain cortical atrophy whose successful clinical outcome will depend on anorexia's prompt and effective treatment.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood.

WHAT IS GLUTEN SENSITIVITY? Coeliac disease is a classic gluten sensitive enteropathy, typically presenting in childhood. It is common with a prevalence of between 1 : 80 and 1 : 300. There is characteristic small bowel villous atrophy (Fig. 1a) associated with abdominal pain, malabsorption and weight loss.

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is still debated whether the deterioration of the sleep pattern, frequently reported by elderly subjects, is due only to aging per se. Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

      "abstract": "Sthulta (Obesity) critical impacted on physical, mental and social wellbeing of a sufferer, could complicate mild diseases and a major reason of high mortality of a serious illness. Improper practicing of Ahar (diet) and Vihar (life style) are responsible to alter normal functioning of Agni consequently in place of Prasad bhag (nourishment), Ama (raw or toxin) is produced which has potency to disturb normal functioning by variating the Dosha, Dhatu and Mala thus cause various ailments. Three major forms of Agnis i.e., Jathragni, Bhutagni and Dhatuagni have potential to execute all bodily functions from cellular and systemic level. Dhatuagnis responsible for regular successive dhatu formation get power from Jathragni through bhutagni. Disturbing state of Agni may be of hypoactive, hyperactive or improper/disturbed type. In Sthulta hypoactive Medoagni cause to produce Ama meda which tend to accumulate and obstruct the Medovah strotas, which pollute internal environment. Sthulta is considered as chronic and hardly to cure type of ailment, therefore it has to be managed. Nidan parivarja, Aptarpana techniques, and Lekhaniya mahakashya help to assimilate Ama and normalise Meda dhatu. This article presents elaborated description of Sthulta, its causative factor Agni and details of management is explained through fundamentals mentioned in Ayurveda.",

      "title": "Het mechanisme hoe slaapdeprivatie obesitas induceerd",
      "abstract": "Slaapdeprivatie en obesitas zijn grote publieke gezondheidsproblemen met grote sociale-, persoonlijke- en gezondheidszorgkosten en problemen. Slaapdeprivatie is geassocieerd met obesitas in vele epidemiologische studies. De prevalentie van obesitas neemt toe en de gemiddelde slaapduur neemt af, maar waar deze correlatie vandaan komt en welk causaal mechanisme hiervoor verantwoordelijk is is nog niet vastgesteld. De vraag die in deze scriptie beantwoord zal worden is wat de invloed is van slaapdeprivatie op voedselinname en obesitas en welk causaal mechanisme hieraan ten grondslag ligt. \r\n\r\nSlaapdeprivatie is een toestand waarin men onvoldoende, 5 uur in 24 uur, slaap krijgt, dit leidt tot een homeostatisch stressvolle situatie waardoor het lichaam meer energie wil opslaan om hierop te kunnen anticiperen. In onze huidige maatschappij is er altijd meer dan voldoende voedsel aanwezig wat ertoe leidt dat een dergelijke situatie leidt tot gewichtstoename. De prefrontale cortex, thalamus, parietale kwab en het limbische systeem laten verhoogde activiteit zien bij slaapdeprivatie, wat ertoe kan leiden dat men humeuriger wordt, de cognitieve - en motorische prestaties achteruit gaan en de remming op gedragingen verminderd wordt. Slaapdeprivatie leidt tot verhoogd energieverbruik (90 kcal) door additionele waaktijd en verhoogde energie inname (300-550 kcal) door verhoogde inname van snacks laat op de avond, wat een positieve energiebalans als gevolg heeft. De voedingsmiddelen die geconsumeerd worden bevatten meer vet, koolhydraten en zijn energierijker en verhoogde inname hiervan zal uiteindelijk leiden tot gewichtstoename. Wanneer er onderzocht wordt wat de causaliteit is van deze observeringen wordt er geen netto effect gezien van de hormonen ghreline en leptine, en het effect van GLP-1 is sekse afhankelijk. Slaapdeprivatie induceert verhoogde activiteit in hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor plezier, beloning, motivatie en salience. Met name de insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal prefrontale cortex en de OFC zijn geactiveerd, waarbij er verhoogde connectiviteit is gezien tussen de dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, de insula en het putamen. \r\n\r\nDoor slaapdeprivatie worden gebieden in de hersenen geactiveerd, dit wordt geinduceerd vanuit de hypothalamus naar hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor genot, beloning en motivatie. Deze activatie leidt tot een grotere salience en verhoogde beloning van ongezonde voeding, waardoor men deze voedingsmiddelen meer gaat consumeren als reactie op slaapdeprivatie wat op den duur zal leiden tot gewichtstoename en obesitas.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

      "abstract": "Patients often complain of indigestion, but what do they mean? Indigestion is an old English word that means lack of adequate digestion, but patients and doctors interpret this in different ways. Many patients mean heartburn or acid regurgitation, the classic symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Some describe belching, abdominal rumblings, or even bad breath as indigestion. Others mean pain localised to the epigastrium or a non-painful discomfort in the upper abdomen which may be described as fullness, bloating, or an inability to finish a normal meal (early satiety). Dyspepsia is best restricted to mean pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. #### Major structural causes of dyspepsia Overlap of subgroups of dyspepsia based on symptoms in patients with documented functional dyspepsia There are many causes of dyspepsia, but at least two thirds of patients have no structural or biochemical explanation for their symptoms. It has been suggested that dyspepsia can be subdivided based on groups (or clusters) of symptoms. However, subgroups have not proved to be of value in identifying the underlying cause of dyspepsia and overlap considerably. Some patients report having troublesome burping associated with abdominal bloating or discomfort that is transiently relieved by bringing up the wind. These patients have aerophagy, and repeated swallowing of air may be obvious during the consultation. History taking is key to identifying the likely cause of dyspepsia. ### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease It is important and practical to distinguish gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) from dyspepsia. Frequent heartburn is a cardinal symptom of GORD; acid reflux causes a retrosternal or epigastric burning feeling that characteristically radiates up towards the throat, is relieved transiently by antacids, and is precipitated by a meal or by lying down. #### Uncommon causes of upper abdominal pain or discomfort that may be confused with dyspepsia",

In developing criteria for the diagnosis of MDE, the framers of the<i>DSM-III</i>were not trying to limit excessive diagnosis, as was the case with schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, however, there are few severity requirements for the<i>DSM-III</i>diagnostic criteria of MDE.

A symptom may be presumed to be a psychological manifestation of the eating disorder and inappropriately dismissed for further medical evaluation. Alternatively, a detailed medical workup may be performed, overlooking a classic relationship between starvation and a physical finding, which delays referral to eating disorder care. This review article focuses on rare medical issues (also called “zebras” in medical training), diagnoses that may be missed in patients with eating disorders, and best practices for management, organized by organ system. Method A PubMed search was performed, using search terms “eating disorder,” “anorexia nervosa,” and “bulimia nervosa” in combination with different words for each organ system and known medical manifestations of severe eating disorders, with high quality and relevant studies from the past 20 years cited. Discussion Adults with eating disorders may present with extreme organ dysfunction and atypical signs and symptoms of typical medical problems. Timely diagnosis, risk awareness, appropriate treatment, and avoidance of harm are all vital. With judicious management and nutritional rehabilitation, most of these complications will significantly improve or resolve. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2016; 49:331–344).",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "title": "Lacosamide induced aggression in a patient with seizure disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, The commonest psychiatric side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are aggression and irritability.[1] There are serious behavioral and psychological repercussions caused by the changes in the Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic activity caused by AEDs on certain regions of the brain such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus.[2] There are modifications in the GABA receptors and GABAergic neurons in an epileptic brain, which cause medications that enhance GABA neurotransmission to potentially trigger or exacerbate aggression, as opposed to their effect of decreasing aggression in subjects without epilepsy.[2] A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to the psychiatry ward with complaints of laughing inappropriately, irrelevant talk, overfamiliarity, over-talkativeness, inappropriate behavior towards women, irritability with the use of abusive language without provocation, and decreased sleep. These complaints have been present intermittently for the last 3 years. The patient was diagnosed with a seizure disorder at 6 months of age. His last seizure was 10 months before admission, after which a significant worsening of symptoms was noted, especially inappropriate laughter, irrelevant talk, and inappropriate behavior with women. Physical examination was unremarkable. Mental Status Examination showed a kempt, cooperative patient, in touch with reality, who laughed without provocation and behaved inappropriately with the examiner, by attempting to undress. During treatment in the hospital, the patient suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the ward. The neurologist also prescribed a tab of lacosamide (LCM) 100 mg twice daily. After 2 days of starting the patient on LCM, a sudden increase in aggressive behavior was noted, in a patient who previously showed no aggressive behavior in the ward or before admission apart from intermittent irritability. The patient broke the railing of a bed and attacked his mother and doctors in the ward, threw a metal stool in an attempt to injure another patient, and was verbally and physically abusive towards relatives, doctors, and other ward staff, requiring chemical and physical restraint. No such aggressive behavior was observed when the patient was previously on carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine. The aggression was therefore attributed to the addition of LCM and the same was stopped. Following this, the patient's aggression decreased and then stopped within 72 hours. The patient was discharged on: T. Oxcarbazepine 450 mg twice daily, T. Divalproate 750 mg twice daily, T. Risperidone 2 mg twice daily, and T. Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily. On review after a month, his mother reported no aggressive behavior. While the exact mechanism behind behavioral problems that are seen in seizure disorders is still unclear, its occurrence can be attributed to many factors such as the neuropathology of epileptic syndromes, functional damage caused by the seizure, comorbid developmental disorders, anti-epileptic drugs, etc.[3] The changes that occur in the central GABAergic activity due to LCM play a contributory role in drug-induced behavioral changes.[2] The effects of the CBZ, levetiracetam (LEV), perampanel (PER), and LCM on aggression were studied using the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire in 266 consecutive outpatients with epilepsy. The LEV group had a significantly higher aggression score as compared to the CBZ and LCM groups. Based on these results the authors concluded that LEV increased aggression, while CBZ and LCM reduced aggression.[1] Our patient, however, showed the opposite findings. A thorough psychiatric history and any history that indicates a propensity for aggression must be taken from patients and their caregivers. While this may not stop the prescription of anti-epileptic drugs, drugs that are more likely to result in such behavior may be regulated, while also looking out for these side effects that are considered rare. There is limited knowledge on aggression and personality changes caused by using LCM, requiring further investigation to prescribe appropriate anti-epileptic drugs.

These three functions may vary, from a normal base-line of activity, in either an overactive or an underactive direction. Overactivity leads to hypermotility, vascular engorgement, and excessive secretion; underactivity leads to hypomotility, vascular pallor, and minimal secretion. It is generally felt that these states are mediated through the rich innervation of the gastrointestinal tract with both sympathetic and parasympathetic elements of the autonomic nervous system. Extensive experimental work has shown that the most significant factors in varying states of motility, vascularity, and secretion appear to be emotional ones.* These three functions may change rapidly, within minutes, depending on the emotional state of the subject. Feelings of marked anxiety, unexpressed or unaware anger and resentment, and frustrated needs for affection may lead to hypermotility, hypervascularity, and hypersecretion.

      "title": "Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SE-AN): in search of a new paradigm",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is one of the earliest psychiatric illnesses to be described in the medical literature with well documented accounts made in the 19th century by both Gull [1] and Lasegue [2]. They both expressed optimism about the eventual outcome of treatment. Since then, there have been many claims about successful outcomes, but all too often only reversal of the undernourished state is achieved [3]. Treatment may have minimal impact on the persistent and unrelenting ruminations pertaining to food, shape and weight which are so characteristic of those with SE-AN. Good progress has been made in treating younger patients with a shorter duration of illness using family-based approaches [4, 5] but it is those who either fail to respond, or go on to develop a severe and enduring form of the disorder (SE-AN), that have received little or no attention to date [6].\r\n\r\nThose living with a chronic illness, especially one as debilitating as SE-AN, are entitled to dream of a better tomorrow and to feel understood not only by the medical profession but by the world at large [7]. Almost every day, we are reminded about the extra-ordinary breakthroughs being made in the fight against cancer, whilst we continue to battle over the vexed issues of the imposition of involuntary treatment and the ethics of palliative care. Patients with SE-AN can no longer be ignored for they have suffered for far too long, having to contend with an abysmal quality of life devoid of any hope of an effective treatment on the horizon. This situation is in urgent need of address especially since there has only been one randomised controlled trial to date [8] that has specifically focussed upon those with the severe and enduring form of the illness. Much more needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe time has now arrived to take the bold step in reconceptualising illness severity in anorexia nervosa especially since there is a growing recognition that the factors that may contribute towards its onset are not necessarily the same as the ones that may perpetuate it [9]. Our current classification system (DSM-5), although an improvement over its predecessors, remains limited in its clinical utility especially when identifying the onset of illness (when treatment is most likely to be effective) and giving special recognition to those when it becomes persistent [10, 11]. We have provided a cogent argument that a clinical staging model, that is so widespread in the conceptualisation and treatment of somatic illness, be adopted in anorexia nervosa. Such a model has been applied in malignancies, cardiac failure, auto-immune disease and burns where both prognosis and treatment are informed by stage [12]. Anorexia nervosa is ideally suited for the adoption of a staging model, because unlike any other psychiatric disorder, it has clearly delineated physical biomarkers of disease progression, for example bradycardia and raised liver enzymes [13] Like so many illnesses, anorexia nervosa exists on a spectrum. Just as there is no single treatment advocated for all cancers, there should not only be one treatment for all patients with anorexia nervosa. It is clear that a 14 year old adolescent with a 3 month history of anorexia nervosa would present differently to a 40 year old woman who has battled the illness for 25 years with multiple hospital admissions and has attempted cognitive behaviour therapy several times. Those with SE-AN are more likely to have high levels of disability, to be under- or unemployed, to be receiving welfare, supported by health benefit plans and become a significant burden to family, carers and health fund providers. In fact on measures such as quality of life, those with SE-AN have been found to be equal in impairment to those with severe depressive disorder as well as schizophrenia [14]. Such factors provide a compelling argument as to why a rehabilitation model of care, not too dissimilar to the ones advocated for those with schizophrenia, needs to be considered for those with a persistent eating disorder including highly specialised acute care when the need arises.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that such patients with SE-AN are amongst the most challenging found in mental health care [15]. They have a markedly reduced life expectancy with the highest mortality rate of any mental illness (at 20 years the mortality rate is 20 %). Because the onset of anorexia nervosa occurs at a young age, it is unfortunately not uncommon for death to occur in young adults in their thirties with a further 5-10 % every decade thereafter [16]. They suffer from a myriad of medical complications and are frequent but often reluctant visitors to general and specialist medical facilities as well as primary care services [6].\r\n\r\nMost patients with SE-AN are unlikely to fully recover. Some do but they are in the minority. It is therefore extremely important not to focus solely upon symptom reduction, but to also take into account a more holistic model of care. Such a’ recovery model’ needs to take cognisance of the person as a whole by improving not only quality of life, but overall general functioning, employment and access to suitable housing as well [17]. This requires that our more traditional approaches to treatment, developed for earlier stages of severity, undergo a metamorphosis to better fit the needs of those with a chronic and often unrelenting illness [18].\r\n\r\nIn a recent randomised controlled trial we attempted to capitalise on those principles advocated by the ‘recovery model’ by comparing two psychological treatments which were specifically adapted for those with a more chronic disorder (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-SE) and Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM-SE)) [8]. The hallmark and defining feature of this study, was that for the first time symptom reduction was not designated as a primary outcome measure. Weight gain was actively promoted but the primary goal was an enhanced quality of life. Both treatment arms were successful in promoting change and by the 12th month follow-up period, those patients receiving CBT-SE had lower Eating Disorders Examination global scores as well as a higher readiness to recover than those receiving SSCM-SE. However, the standout feature was the remarkably low treatment attrition rate of 13 % [19] which to our knowledge is one of the lowest ever reported. We need to rethink our treatment strategies by drawing upon the patient’s strengths and competencies rather than merely paying attention to what is ‘wrong’ with them. Undertaking treatment with a poorly motivated, chronically ill patient where loneliness, despair and an empty sense of self prevail, poses unique challenges for clinicians. As Strober [15] has cautioned, such a therapeutic endeavour requires a temperament capable of enduring hours of “…sameness, respect for solitude, the ability to face frailty and profound sickness with relative ease and the ability and willingness to explore the wounds and deprivation of a life passed by”. It is also so important to never lose the sense of hope as some (albeit few) go on to make a complete recovery.\r\n\r\nBecause of the plight of those afflicted with SE-AN [20], researchers and clinicians are now pushing the frontiers of science by exploring new and bold avenues of investigation such as deep brain stimulation [18, 21] and transcranial magnetic stimulation [18, 22]. As we delve into this brave new world, it is important not lose sight of the first rule of medicine - primum non nocere. Some people with SE-AN are so desperate to seek relief for their untold misery that they will agree to almost anything that promises relief from their suffering and despair. The ethical debate has already begun as to whether interventions such as deep brain stimulation is in fact offering hope to the hopeless or merely exploiting the vulnerable [23].\r\n\r\nThere is now more than ever before a compelling need to bring such new ideas and emerging data to the fore in a timely fashion so that replication of the most promising new data can occur and the ethical considerations widely debated. The wheel may have already started to turn with a plenary session debating this issue at the next Eating Disorder Research Society Meeting [24] in Sicily in September. Furthermore, this journal (Journal of Eating Disorders) plans to publish a special issue entirely dedicated to those patients not only with anorexia nervosa (SE-AN), but those falling within the broader spectrum of eating disorders as well. It is hoped that such a special issue focussing entirely upon those with a persistent eating disorder will not only draw attention to this long-suffering group, but also generate new avenues of exploration as well.",

In the phenomenological perspective, the classic symptoms of bulimia nervosa, including the overvaluation of body shapes and weight for self-esteem, are epiphenomena of a deeper core nucleus represented by a disorder of the embodiment, which consists in an alteration of the way that people experience their own body and shape their personal identity. According to the optical-cenesthetic hypothesis, the embodiment disorder derives from a disproportion between the optical and the cenesthetic perception of one's body, as a consequence of the interoceptive deficits that characterize patients with bulimia nervosa. As an effect of the incapacity to experience one's body from within, patients with bulimia nervosa adopt a maladaptive coping mechanism focused on external means of self-definition, and the body becomes just an object that is looked at by others. The implications of embodiment disturbances regard not just eating behaviors but also many other domains of life in patients with bulimia nervosa, including the evaluation of time or space dimensions and sexuality. Beyond bulimia nervosa, embodiment disturbances were shown to influence body image concerns and sexuality in other clinical samples, as well as in the general population.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "title": "[Diurnal rhythm of pain in sciatica. Preliminary report].",
      "abstract": "Similarly as nearly all processes taking place continuously in the organism pain shows also frequently a circadian rhythm. In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

Usually hiccups stop within a few hours, but some can not stop. Persistent and intractable hiccups typically defined as lasting for more than 48 hours and one month respectively.(2) Intractable hiccups often limits a patient’s activities of daily living and may significantly lower functional status and quality of life. Sometimes intractable hiccups produce severe morbidity including insomnia, fatigue, malnutrition, weight loss, exhaustion, and even death. Despite these potentially fatal complications, definite treatment strategies are still unknown.(3-5) We describe the case of a patient with intractable hiccups unresponsive to pharmacotherapy, who was successfully treated with continuous cervical epidural block.

      "abstract": "Punding is a stereotypical behavior in which there is an intense fascination with repetitive handling and examining of mechanical objects, such as taking apart watches and radios or arranging common objects (lining up pebbles, rocks, or other small objects). This disabling condition, different from both obsessive–compulsive disorder and mania, is probably underreported. Punding is thought to be related to dopaminergic stimulation, although only a few observations of this condition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) under therapy has been reported. We report a man with PD who developed an unusual, severe, repetitive behavior characterized by spending most of his time on his computer; this abnormal behavior was concomitant with the introduction of L-dopa (400 mg per day) and was not associated to a pattern of chronic inappropriate overuse of dopaminergic medication or other psychiatric symptoms. The patient had the feeling he was forced into a disruptive and unproductive behavior, and he made several attempts to quit without succeeding. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Seizures in Alzheimer Disease",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Transient symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) are frequent and include seizures, syncope, and episodes of inattention or confusion. The incidence of seizures in AD and predictors of which patients with AD might be more predisposed to them is based primarily on retrospective studies and is not well established. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the incidence and predictors of new-onset unprovoked seizures. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Three academic centers. <h3>Patients</h3> Four hundred fifty-three patients with probable AD observed prospectively from mild disease stages since 1992. <h3>Main Outcome Measure</h3> Informant interviews every 6 months included questions about whether the patient had a seizure (convulsion, fainting, or “funny” spell) and whether diagnosis or treatment for epilepsy or seizure was made. Two epileptologists independently retrospectively reviewed all available medical records for 52 patients with positive responses to either of these questions, and using a specific checklist form, events were diagnosed as to whether they were unprovoked seizures (intrarater concordance, κ = 0.67). Diagnosis of unprovoked seizures constituted the event in survival analyses. Potential predictors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational achievement, duration of illness, baseline cognition and function, depression, medical comorbidities, and time-dependent use of cholinesterase inhibitors and neuroleptic agents, apolipoprotein E genotype, and previous electroencephalographic findings. <h3>Results</h3> Over the course of 3518 visit-assessments (per patient: mean, 7.8; maximum, 27), 7 patients (1.5%) developed seizures. Younger age was associated with higher risk (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.41;<i>P</i> = .003 for each additional year of age) of seizure incidence. No other predictor was significant. The overall incidence of seizures was low (418 per 100 000 person-years of observation) although significantly higher than expected for idiopathic unprovoked seizures in similar age ranges of the general population (hazard ratio, 8.06; 95% confidence interval, 3.23-16.61). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Unprovoked seizures are uncommon in AD, but they do occur more frequently than in the general population. Younger age is a risk factor for seizures in AD.",

New Results: Chronic drug use indeed impacts negatively on human's cognitive functions, especially in terms of attention, learning, and memory. With increasing amount of certain drug use, the degree of impairments also increases. It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

      "title": "Exercise-induced muscle pain, soreness, and cramps.",
      "abstract": "The three types of pain related to exercise are 1) pain experienced during or immediately following exercise, 2) delayed onset muscle soreness, and 3) pain induced by muscle cramps. Each is characterized by a different time course and different etiology. Pain perceived during exercise is considered to result from a combination of factors including acids, ions, proteins, and hormones. Although it is commonly believed that lactic acid is responsible for this pain, evidence suggests that it is not the only factor. However, no single factor has ever been identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness develops 24-48 hours after strenuous exercise biased toward eccentric (muscle lengthening) muscle actions or strenuous endurance events like a marathon. Soreness is accompanied by a prolonged strength loss, a reduced range of motion, and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood. These are taken as indirect indicators of muscle damage, and biopsy analysis has documented damage to the contractile elements. The exact cause of the soreness response is not known but thought to involve an inflammatory reaction to the damage. Muscle cramps are sudden, intense, electrically active contractions elicited by motor neuron hyperexcitability. Although it is commonly assumed that cramps during exercise are the result of fluid electrolyte imbalance induced by sweating, two studies have not supported this. Moreover, participants in occupations that require chronic use of a muscle but do not elicit profuse sweating, such as musicians, often experience cramps. Fluid electrolyte imbalance may cause cramps if there is profuse prolonged sweating such as that found in working in a hot environment. Thus, despite the common occurrence of pain associated with exercise, the exact cause of these pains remains a mystery.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This disorder is characterized by recurrent, massive myoclonic jerks involving large muscle groups (ie, entire body, trunk, or extremities) that occur only during sleep (predominantly during quiet sleep) among infants during the first year of life, usually from birth to 6 months of age. The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

Dabei ist weiterhin ein abwärtsgerichteter Alterstrend zu verzeichnen, sodass sich beide Erkrankungen in immer früherem Alter manifestieren. Dadurch steigt die Bedeutung dieser beiden Störungen enorm - auch in den Hausarztpraxen. Für eine adäquate Behandlung und zur Verhinderung von Folgeerkrankungen ist eine genaue Diagnostik und differenzialdiagnostische Abklärung notwendig. Dazu gehört auch eine psychosoziale Anamnese, zum Beispiel im Rahmen der psychosomatischen Grundversorgung, wobei hier das ärztliche Gespräch im Mittelpunkt steht. Zu beachten ist, dass bei essgestörten Patienten starke Dissimulations- und Verleugnungstendenzen sowie Motivations- und Complianceprobleme häufig sind. Insbesondere wenn es um die Behandlung der Komorbidität geht, sollte ein fachärztlicher oder psychotherapeutischer Kollege bzw. eine fachärztliche oder psychotherapeutische Kollegin zu Rate gezogen werden. Die Hausärztin bzw. der Hausarzt ist aber meist die erste Anlaufstelle für den Patienten oder dessen Angehörige, sie oder er muss die Probleme erkennen und gegebenenfalls rechtzeitig überweisen.",

      "abstract": "Individuals experiencing symptoms related to acid reflux (e.g. heartburn and regurgitation) commonly seek treatment with self-care modalities. The availability of non-prescription medications for reflux symptoms in Australia provides an important opportunity for pharmacists to guide individuals on how to effectively manage their symptoms. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective treatment for frequent heartburn (two or more days per week), and, as a result, the use of PPIs has increased markedly over past decades. Currently, five PPIs are available in Australia without a prescription. Treatment guidelines for self-managing frequent heartburn recommend a two-week therapeutic course with a non-prescription PPI in individuals experiencing typical symptoms. However, in practice these individuals may use PPIs intermittently even initially. Pharmacists can help identify appropriate candidates for non-prescription PPIs by inquiring about the nature of their symptoms, including frequency and severity, response to prior interventions, concomitant medications and comorbidities. The presence of atypical symptoms or alarm features, such as chest pain or difficulty swallowing, or a lack of response to a known effective treatment requires referral to a physician for further evaluation. Pharmacists can also ensure that individuals are aware of potential adverse events and drug interactions, and they can clarify expectations about treatment response, including acknowledgement that several days of therapy may be needed to experience a full treatment effect.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of stomach function refer to neuromuscular abnormalities of gastric motility that involve the fundus, corpus, antrum, pylorus, and antroduodenal coordination. Symptoms related to disorders of stomach function are commonly meal-related; \"dyspepsia\" symptoms of epigastric fullness; or bloating, discomfort, and nausea in the postprandial period. Early satiety and prolonged stomach fullness are often present, and in severe cases the patient may vomit undigested food. Neuromuscular disorders of stomach function should not be considered until structural and metabolic diseases that may also cause these nonspecific symptoms are excluded. A thorough history, routine laboratory studies, ultrasound of the gallbladder and pancreas, and upper endoscopy will exclude the majority of diseases that may cause dyspepsia symptoms. Disorders of gastric neuromuscular function may be detected by solid-phase gastric emptying studies which detect gastroparesis and by electrogastrography which detects abnormalities of gastric myoelectrical activity termed gastric dysrhythmias. Invasive tests to determine abnormalities in gastric motility include intraluminal pressure and gastric tone/compliance recordings. Treatment approaches are limited at the present time and include dietary counseling and gastroprokinetic agents such as metoclopromide, cisapride, and erythromycin. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of gastric neuromuscular function will lead to an improved and more rational armamentarium for the treatment of symptoms related to functional disorders of the stomach.",

      "title": "Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAnaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The reaction can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen (e.g., peanuts and bee sting). If it is not treated immediately, typically with an epinephrine muscular injection, it can result in unconsciousness or death. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a rare allergic response in which anaphylaxis occurs with physical activity/exercise. Sometimes an EIA reaction will occur only if exercise takes place within a few hours of eating a specific food(s) or sometimes any given food (1). This is called food-dependent EIA. This is a potentially life-threatening condition, and although rare, exercise professionals should be aware of EIA. This Medical Report column will discuss the basic epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of EIA. EPIDEMIOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY EIA can occur at any age, but data suggest it most often occurs in adolescents and young adults (2). Some suggest that women are more susceptible (due to the menstrual cycle) (2). There seems to be no correlation between ethnicity and increased prevalence (3). What is important to know is that EIA can occur at any age, gender, and ethnicity. Epidemiologic studies have reported a range of 8 to 50 per 100,000 person-years, with a lifetime prevalence of 0.05% to 2.0% (3).\"What is important to know is that EIA can occur at any age, gender, and ethnicity. Epidemiologic studies have reported a range of 8 to 50 per 100,000 person-years, with a lifetime prevalence of 0.05% to 2.0% (3).\" The exercises that can elicit an EIA reaction vary. Although moderate- to high-intensity exercise is common, even activities such as yard work have been shown to trigger EIA (2,4). Exercises with less cardiorespiratory demand (e.g., resistance training) appear to be safer. Some of the more common types of exercise shown to trigger a reaction are listed below: □ Running □ Walking □ Cycling □ Aerobics (e.g., elliptical training and stair climbing) □ Tennis/racquetball □ Dancing The pathophysiology of EIA is not fully understood (1,4–6). However, a couple of suggested mechanisms do exist (3). One is mast cell degranulation, resulting in the release of histamine (3). Another is an increase in intestinal permeability, which will increase antigen uptake, causing EIA symptoms (6). Common symptoms of EIA are listed in the Table. The symptoms of EIA and food-dependent EIA are the same. TABLE - Common Symptoms of EIA Urticaria (hives) Pruritus (itching) Flushing Extreme fatigue Wheezing/stridor (wheezing in the neck) Difficulty breathing Throat tightness Hypotension Lightheadedness Angioedema Abdominal cramping Nausea Headache Syncope during exercise or shortly afterward Symptoms typically develop within 5 minutes of exercise and can last 30 minutes to 4 hours postexercise. Data from Huynh (1), Christensen et al. (5), and Feldweg (10). Food-dependent EIA occurs when a specific food(s) or any food is ingested before exercise, usually 4 to 6 hours prior (1,3). Any number of foods can trigger a reaction. Sometimes a specific food cannot be identified, and the person needs to avoid eating anything for 4 to 6 hours before exercise (this is known as non-specific food-dependent EIA). Other times the specific food or foods are identified, and the person needs only to avoid eating these foods before exercise (7). Some of the more common foods that trigger a reaction are listed in the sidebar. It should be noted that these are the most common foods reported to trigger EIA; however, the reader can refer to the citations for a more comprehensive list.Sidebar: Most common foods reported to trigger EIA □ Tomatoes □ Peanuts □ Wheat □ Seafood (particularly shellfish) □ Milk □ Eggs □ Cheese □ Alcohol □ Red meat □ Some vegetables and fruits (e.g., oranges, grapes, and celery) (3,7–9)In summary, with food-dependent EIA, the trigger may be one specific food, multiple specific foods, or unknown food(s). Other potential EIA triggers include NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, naprosyn, and ibuprofen), extreme environmental conditions, and female menses (2,3,10). MANAGEMENT Although research is ongoing, management of EIA has not changed significantly in recent years (7). The clinical diagnostic workup for someone who has experienced EIA starts with a physician, usually an immunologist. The physician will perform a medical history and exam and perform a number of tests. These usually include skin testing for various allergies, blood work, and possibly an EIA challenge exercise test. The EIA challenge exercise test will be performed in a physician-supervised environment. The test will often be performed on a treadmill or stationary bike. If there is any suspected food or foods that contributed to the EIA reaction, the person may consume these foods before the test. It is important to note that a positive test confirms the diagnosis, but a negative test does not prove that EIA did not occur because episodes of EIA are not fully predictable. Prevention is the best treatment for those with EIA. Avoiding possible triggers for EIA is crucial. Exercising in extreme outdoor conditions (e.g., very hot, humid, or cold) should be avoided (3). Those with seasonal allergies also should avoid outdoor exercise when their respective allergen(s) count is high (e.g., pollen, grass, and trees) (3). Indoor exercise should be performed in these situations. Aspirin and other NSAIDs should not be taken before exercise (4,10). Women should refrain from exercise during their menstrual cycle (2). EIA during pregnancy is not well studied (2). Pregnant women with a history of EIA should consult with their obstetrician regarding exercise during pregnancy. It would be prudent to recommend that postpartum women with a history of EIA resume exercise gradually. \"Prevention is the best treatment for those with EIA. Avoiding possible triggers for EIA is crucial. Exercising in extreme outdoor conditions (e.g., very hot, humid, or cold) should be avoided (3).\" For those with food-dependent EIA, it is recommended to avoid eating 4 to 6 hours preexercise (1). Some evidence exists that food-dependent EIA can have a sequence of events in reverse (3). This means that eating shortly after exercise can cause EIA. It would be prudent to not only avoid eating 4 to 6 hours preexercise but also avoid eating for at least 1 hour postexercise (3,4). It is important to stop exercise immediately if symptoms develop. Although other medications such as antihistamines have been shown to work, epinephrine muscular injection should be the first medication administered (10). Thus, having an epinephrine pen (EpiPen) available at all times during exercise is crucial to stop any EIA reaction. It is important to periodically check the expiration date and refill the prescription before it expires. Wearing a medical identification bracelet will help in a medical emergency, should an affected individual fall into unconsciousness. Exercising in a group setting or with a partner will increase exercise safety. SUMMARY The exercise professional should be aware of this rare but dangerous condition. A history of EIA should surface during a health and fitness assessment. This way the exercise professional can help increase exercise training safety by making any necessary exercise modifications. Most importantly, make sure the client has their epinephrine pen with them at all times. A strong focus on preventative measures will maximize safe and effective exercise and enhance the client's experience.",

Two boys had episodes of abnormal behavior in hypnagogic-and occasionally hypnopompic-periods for 1 year from the time they were 1 year and several months old. The episodes consisted of irregular body movements, which could be either gentle or violent but never made the children get out of bed. They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood. The clinical profile does not fit any of the known parasomnias and might belong to a new category of parasomnia.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "title": "“In the End, the One Who has Nothing Wins”: Louise Glück and the Poetics of Anorexia",
      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes 1. References to \"anorexia\" should be understood to indicate the psychological disorder \"anorexia nervosa\" that involves deliberate and prolonged self-starvation. The full term has been used by the biomedical community to describe self-induced starvation since the mid-nineteenth century when two doctors, W. W. Gull of England and Charles Lesegue of France, independently published papers describing the seemingly rare disorder. The syndrome has now become so common that it is included in the DSM-III-R, the American Psychiatric Association's manual for diagnosing psychological disorders and syndromes. Briefly, the criteria for diagnosis include (1) refusal to maintain body weight at the minimum expected for age and height; (2) an intense fear of gaining weight; (3) a distorted body image; and (4) amenorrhea. 2. Bruch is still considered by many to be the greatest authority among psychologists and psychiatrists in the field of eating disorders. For her detailed accounts of her interactions with her patients, see Conversations with Anorexics and The Golden Cage. The range and number of studies of anorexia make it impossible to fully account for this diversity here, but one example of the conflicting views held by therapists and psychologists includes British psychologist Arthur Crisp's suggestion that anorexia is an expression the patient's resistance to \"growing up\" and becoming a woman, versus Bruch's idea that anorexia is an attempt to create boundaries and put a barrier between the anorexic and her mother in particular. To get a sense of the variety of assessments based on biomedical and psychiatric research, see Garfinkel and Garner's Anorexia Nervosa: A Multidimensional Perspective. In their respective studies, Joan Brumberg and Helen Malson provide excellent overviews of the ways anorexia has been diagnosed, characterized, and assessed since its \"discovery.\" 3. MacSween and Bordo are among the most prominent critics to draw on poststructuralist theory in their understandings of anorexia; Malson's The Thin Woman brings a poststructuralist understanding of language to clinical work. Noelle Caskey has analyzed anorexia in light of Foucault's theories about bodies and power, and Marta Robertson also engages constructionist ideas about culture, subjectivity, and language to varying degrees. Susie Orbach, Marilyn Lawrence, and Kim Chernin are well known, for their more popular, mass-market books that approach anorexia from a therapeutic point of view; their work takes a commonsense feminist approach that has its basis in identity politics. 4. See for example, Deborah Ann Thompson's \"Anorexia as a Lived Trope: Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market'\" and Barbara Antonina Clark Mossberg's chapter \"The Aesthetics of Anorexia\" in Emily Dickinson: When a Writer is a Daughter. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar discuss anorexia as a mode of behavior in nineteenth-century literature in The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination as does Paula Marantz Cohen in \"The Anoretic Syndrome and the Nineteenth-Century Domestic Novel.\" For a discussion of the ways Margaret Atwood uses anorexia as a literary trope, see Tracy Brain's, \"Figuring Anorexia: Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman.\" 5. See Charles Shepherdson's \"The Epoch of the Body: Need and Demand in Kojeve and Lacan\" for an engaging detailing of the ways psychoanalysis must be situated between the ideological and the individual. The notion of the constructed self is, of course, in no way new, and has been articulated by numerous theorists and philosophers in addition to Lacan, including Barthes, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Gitarri, Merleau-Ponty, and Lyotard, among others. 6. In The Thin Woman, Malson uses Lacan's formulation of the \"mirror stage\" and his understanding of the gaze to highlight the ways \"the thin/anorexic body…signifie[s] both an evasion and a courting of a disciplining, individualizing, and gendering gaze\" (178). Ellman's The Hunger Artists: Starving, Writing and Imprisonment draws on psychoanalytic theory to discuss the connections between personal and political self-starvation. In \"Anorexia, Humanism, and Feminism,\" Brown engages with Lacanian theory in order to connect anorexia to the ideal of liberal humanism and to the philosophical developments of the Enlightenment. On the one hand, Brown suggests, the anorexic \"can be seen as exercising her right to free speech and privacy and to the management of herself\" and at the same time can be understood as a \"passive, beleaguered invalid\" whose regime is determined by the social will (190–91). By placing the contradictions of anorexia within the context of liberal humanist ideology, Brown underscores the \"strikingly anti-humanist dimensions to humanist principles\" (191) and shows that anorexia can expose the limits of the human will and the (im)possibility of self-determination. 7. A number of psychologists have noted that familial \"enmeshment\" and unclear boundaries often characterize the relationships between family members. This results in a dynamic of alienation and dependency: the anorexic daughter is generally alienated from her own needs—physical and otherwise—and at the same time unusually dependent on others in order to know what she wants, feels, needs. See Bruch's The Golden Cage, Spignesi's Starving Women, and Robertson's Starving in the Silences. In Psychosomatic Families, Salvador Minuchin et al. focus on the tendency for parents of anorexics to be overly protective of their children or too involved in their lives. 8. See Lynn Keller, Diane Bonds, Lee Upton, and E. Laurie George for essays that comment on this discord among Glück's readers. One recent example of this can be seen in reviews of The Seven Ages, one of her most recent books. For David Wojahn, writing in Poetry, the book is evidence that Glück is \"one of our period's undisputed masters\" (169). In contrast, Bruce Bawer, reviewing the book for The Hudson Review, feels Glück is decidedly not at her best; he finds specific poems to be successful but too much of the book is \"windy, phony, [and] highfalutin\" (517). 9. For additional readings that consider Glück's work in relationship to a range of feminist theories, see Elizabeth Dodd, Lynne McMahon, Suzanne Matson, Keller, and Upton. 10. In her essay, Keller suggests that Glück's poems present anorexia as a form of self-assertion for women in a culture that only offers women roles of passivity and objecthood. Basing her analysis on the work of psychologists Garfinkel and Garner, Keller suggests that the anorexic \"can be sure of having or creating an identity as a subject rather than an object,\" noting that Glück's poem points to this idea (123). In contrast, I would argue that Glück's poems describe the opposite: anorexia leads the subject to recognize and experience her status as an object. 11. For an extensive analysis of this poem as an exploration of the causes and consequences of anorexia, see the first chapter in Heywood's Dedication to Hunger. Keller and Dodd also discuss the poem in some detail. 12. As I have already noted, most critics who have explored an anorexic aesthetic in literary texts have primarily discussed anorexia as a disorder of refusal and renunciation. The notable exception is Frances Kerr's article on Louise Bogan, which suggests that in her poetry, Bogan \"registers a paradoxical response\" to the Modernist preference (spearheaded by Pound) for \"thin poetic form\" that is \"purged of self-indulgent, feminine emotion\" (306). Other analyses tend to be more literal in their attempts to connect anorexia to a poetics. See Thompson and Cohen for essays that take a more commonsense approach to exploring anorexic themes in the poetry of Christina Rossetti and Emily Dickinson. 13. Critics have developed a variety of ways of discussing the uncanny, dualistic qualities of Glück's poetics. In an analysis of one of her earliest books, The House on Marshland, Diane Bonds suggests that the poems blur the distinction between the figurative and the literal. Upton and Eric Selinger both draw on the psychoanalytically inflected theories of Julia Kristeva to explain her aesthetic. Upton connects Glück's stance of self-denial and renunciation to Kristeva's theory of abjection. Selinger's essay draws more on Kristeva's ideas about the semiotic that she develops in Revolution in Poetic Language. 14. For a discussion of the relationship between Glück's work and Greek mythology see Dodd's The Veiled Mirror and the Woman Poet. In \"'It Meant I Loved': Louise Glück's Ararat,\" Selinger explores the connection between Ararat and Greek tragedy. 15. As Bruce Bond and Selinger both note, \"Parados\" is the opening song of the chorus in a Greek drama. 16. See Conversations with Anorexics, particularly chapters two and three, for various \"case studies\" that demonstrate that many of Bruch's patients wanted to exist without having to express or deal with their needs. 17. Bond also focuses on the paradoxes and contradictions of this book of poems. He suggests that in Ararat Glück attempts \"to bring together imaginatively, in pursuit of wholeness, the unsettling dualisms which reason cannot reconcile\" (217). 18. While he recognizes that Lacan and other psychoanalytic theorists also provide theories of intersubjectivity, Apprey finds Merleau-Ponty particularly useful in approaching anorexia because he provides \"a place for ambiguity, even opacity [that is] part of the human condition\" (1059). Lacan may have proven just as useful, for he also allows for an \"opacity\" in the human condition that he theorizes as the \"real,\" and ambiguity is precisely what interests him about humanity.

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

      "abstract": "Amnesia is the name given to disorders of memory. Amnesia normally involves severe forgetfulness which goes beyond the everyday forgetting observed in normal people, to the extent that it may interfere with the activities of normal life. We are all prone to moments of forgetfulness, but most people with intact cognitive functioning can remember quite a lot about the events in their lives, especially their most recent experiences and events which are important to them. However, a person suffering from amnesia may be quite unable to remember any recent events in their lives, even the most important ones. You can probably recall quite easily where you were five minutes ago, or the person you just chatted with, or even what you did yesterday evening. Many amnesics would be unable to remember these simple things, and may have no idea of what they have done with their day so far. In severe cases they may be quite unable to commit any new experiences to memory, and this can be very disruptive to their lives. Without an intact memory it can become impossible to keep a job, to keep up relationships with family and friends, or even to look after oneself and maintain an independent existence. In fact it is clear from the study of severely amnesic patients that memory is quite crucial to our ability to function properly as human beings. Amnesia is a very disruptive and distressing condition. However, it is also a disorder from which a great deal can be learned about the nature of memory function.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is a chronic and debilitating illness. In this article, we present an algorithm of the diagnosis and treatment of the illness. We place much importance upon the patient variables associated with the treatment decisions. We emphasize strong patient involvement in treatment as a way to become panic free and improve level of functioning. Panic disorder is defined in DSM-IV1 as \"The presence of recurrent panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attack, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks.\" A panic attack is defined as \"a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes.\" 1) Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint; 9) derealization or depersonalization; 10) fear of losing control or going crazy; 11) fear of dying; 12) paresthesias; 13) chills or hot flashes. The following hypotheses have been used to conceptualize panic disorder from a psychiatrist's perspective.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex gastrointestinal disorder related to over activity of nerves supplying the gut. 1It has been matter of enormous concern for both the patients and treating physicians’ .The clinical course is diverse and takes different twist and turns. Sometimes it does present with typical symptoms like bloating, flatulence and altered bowel habits. At times there is mental illness like severe depression that comes in the way which is real challenge for the physicians to treat as mere reassurance doesn’t suffice. The longer the history of symptoms, more complicated it gets. There are multiple obstacles before making in rows in treatment.2 The most frustrating point is when the patient fails to show any improvement after months of treatment. They have symptoms in relapsing and remitting manner. Post infectious IBS is more agonizing as the patient need antibiotics in an era of increasing resistance .3Failure of one antibiotic to resolve symptoms leads to usage of multiple ones at the same time .The cramping abdominal pain and the sleepless nights leading to daytime fatigue do have an enormous and disastrous impact on the activities of daily living. After the decades of research, optimization of treatment for irritable bowel syndrome is still a daunting task even for experienced gastroenterologists.4 The emergence of alarm symptoms like bleeding per rectum,uninetentional weight loss and feeling of abdominal mass in individuals who have altered bowel for years do ring the bell for physicians to act vigilantly who were otherwise complacent. 4They were relying on traditional treatment regimens like giving laxatives,anti spasmodic and medications for depression.

Such depression and anxiety can last several months and even a year and may be accompanied by symptoms such as frequent weeping with apparently no external or internal reason, lethargy, having no motivation to carry daily tasks, sleeping too much or too little, increased or reduced appetite, and diminished interest in social events. Internet forums and blogs can serve as a good source of emotional support. Women use them much more frequently than men, and they report using these forums mainly to get empathy, warmth, understanding, sense of belonging, and to share their feelings.

      "abstract": "People who suffer from eating disorders often have to be treated against their will, perhaps by being detained, perhaps by being forced to eat. In this paper it is argued that whilst forcing compliance is generally acceptable, there may be circumstances under which a sufferer's refusal of consent to treatment should be respected. This argument will hinge upon whether someone in the grip of an eating disorder can actually make competent decisions about their quality of life. If so, then the decision to refuse therapy may be on a par with other decisions to refuse life-prolonging therapy made by sufferers of debilitating chronic, or acute onset terminal illness. In such cases, palliation might justifiably replace aggressive therapy. The argument will also draw heavily on the distinction between competent refusal of therapy and passive euthanasia, and the distinction between incompetent and irrational decisions. Both distinctions will then be applied to decisions to refuse food. The extent to which sufferers from anorexia nervosa can be categorised as either incompetent or irrational will be examined. It is against this background that it will be argued that at least some of those who suffer from eating disorders should have their refusals respected, even if they may die as a result.",

      "title": "Aplicación del programa de intervención \"talleres de cuidado colaborativo\" en familiares de personas con un trastorno alimentario",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos alimentarios y de la ingesta de alimentos (TA en adelante), entre los que se encuentran la anorexia nerviosa, la bulimia nerviosa y el trastorno por atracon, constituyen un conjunto de cuadros clinicos que se caracterizan por la alteracion de las conductas relacionadas con la alimentacion (restriccion alimentaria, episodios de sobreingesta, atracones, etc.) y por la presencia de metodos de control del peso (vomitos, ejercicio fisico excesivo, laxantes, etc.). Son trastornos psicologicos de etiologia multifactorial y repercusiones serias para quienes los padecen, en todas las areas de su vida (Frank, 2015). No obstante, los aspectos positivos que perciben de los sintomas, como la sensacion de control, autoeficacia, proteccion o seguridad, entre otros, favorecen que presenten ambivalencia frente al cambio y el tratamiento o recuperacion. Cuando el TA se manifiesta, las consecuencias fisicas, psicologicas y sociales que experimentan las personas que lo padecen les llevan a necesitar la asistencia de sus familiares, que asumen el rol de cuidadores, para asi obtener apoyo emocional, instrumental y economico (Dimitropoulos, Klopfer, Lazar y Schacter, 2009). Por tanto, estos problemas de salud implican repercusiones no solo para ellos, sino tambien para sus seres queridos, es decir, para los padres, hermanos, parejas, abuelos y amigos cercanos, entre otros. En esta linea, las consecuencias para los cuidadores de personas con un TA, fruto de su rol, tienden a ser mas negativas que para otros familiares, como los de afectados de esquizofrenia o de depresion, debido a que experimentan una mayor tension en la relacion con quien padece el problema, sienten una preocupacion mas elevada por su salud y su futuro, e indican tener que supervisarle o instarle a afrontar las actividades cotidianas en mayor medida (Martin et al., 2015). En general, las repercusiones psicologicas y emocionales para los seres queridos de quien sufre el TA son graves. Por ejemplo, tienden a percibir una menor sensacion de autoeficacia, y un incremento en la sintomatologia depresiva y ansiosa (Anastasiadou, Sepulveda, Parks, Cuellar-Flores y Graell, 2016; Sim et al., 2009). Por otra parte, el desconocimiento sobre estos problemas de salud contribuye a la aparicion de respuestas emocionales y conductuales desadaptativas (Whitney et al., 2005), que pueden girar en torno al criticismo u hostilidad, o constituir respuestas de ansiedad e hiperproteccion. Estas reacciones, denominadas „emocion expresada‟, pueden influir tambien en los resultados en salud y recuperacion de los propios pacientes. Se genera asi, como resultado, un determinado clima emocional en la familia que puede ser perjudicial para todos sus miembros. Por tanto, se hacen necesarias las intervenciones especificas sobre los cuidadores de personas con TA, con el objetivo de disminuir su malestar emocional y evitar que actuen, en contra de su intencion, como factor mantenedor del problema. Ademas, cabe destacar que el impacto de estos problemas en la salud de los familiares es tan elevado que precisan de una intervencion mas focalizada en ellos para que su malestar disminuya (Slater, Treasure, Schmidt, Gilchrist y Wade, 2015). Uno de los abordajes que existen en la actualidad, centrado especificamente en los cuidadores, es el Maudsley Collaborative Care Skills Workshops (talleres de cuidado colaborativo), desarrollado desde la unidad especializada en TA del South London and Maudsley Hospital, en Reino Unido. Esta intervencion ha demostrado su eficacia en dar respuesta a las necesidades de informacion y de adquisicion de habilidades para manejar el problema que presentan los familiares, ademas de disminuir su malestar psicologico y la carga de cuidado subjetiva que experimentan (Treasure et al., 2007). El objetivo de este programa de intervencion consiste en que los familiares aprendan habilidades de comunicacion y de gestion de las situaciones relacionadas con el TA, para convertirse en cuidadores que guien a sus seres queridos con el problema y les ayuden durante el proceso de enfermedad, relacionandose con ellos de una forma mas positiva (Treasure, Sepulveda, Whitaker, Todd y Lopez, 2010). Hasta el momento, las intervenciones llevadas a cabo desde este marco de referencia ofrecen resultados positivos. Tras el trabajo realizado con los cuidadores, se confirma la reduccion en el malestar psicologico, en la carga de cuidado y en la emocion expresada, manteniendose estos resultados a lo largo de los posteriores seguimientos (Hibbs, Rhind, Leppanen y Treasure, 2015; Pepin y King, 2013; Sepulveda et al., 2010; Treasure y Nazar, 2016; Treasure et al., 2007). Ademas, el feedback directo de los propios cuidadores respalda estos datos, puesto que manifiestan estar satisfechos con los contenidos de los talleres, el incremento del conocimiento sobre su rol como cuidadores, la mejora de la comunicacion en la familia y el poder formar parte de un ambiente de normalizacion del problema, el cual resulta de ayuda para ellos (Goodier et al., 2014; Sepulveda, Lopez, Macdonald y Treasure, 2008; Sepulveda, Lopez, Todd, Whitaker y Treasure, 2008). No obstante, los talleres de cuidado colaborativo para los familiares se han realizado en escasas zonas geograficas, fundamentalmente en Reino Unido, lugar en que se desarrollaron. Pepin y King (2013) senalan la necesidad de aplicar este tipo de talleres en otras localizaciones, para comparar los resultados y averiguar si tienen un impacto similar, observando si existen diferencias culturales. Ademas, cabe senalar que los cuidadores de personas con un TA suelen presentar motivacion para participar en estos programas (Whitaker y Macdonald, 2008), pudiendo resultar un recurso adecuado para ellos, con el objetivo de incrementar su bienestar y sus recursos para hacer frente a las circunstancias adversas. Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo ha sido, por un lado, analizar y describir la representacion de la enfermedad, la emocion expresada, el impacto de los sintomas y el malestar psicologico de los familiares de afectados de TA y, por otro, evaluar la eficacia de los talleres de cuidado colaborativo en cuidadores espanoles, en comparacion con otro programa de intervencion creado ad-hoc, al que se denomino psicoeducativo.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "title": "Дистрес при цукровому діабеті",
      "abstract": "Стресорні чинники викликають у різних людей і навіть в однієї людини відмінні й навіть протилежні реакції. Вплив різноманітних чинників на організм можливо розподілити за силою дії на підпорогові, порогові, стресові (надзвичайні) та руйнівні. При виникненні стресових ситуацій в організмі людини активуються резерви адаптації. Тривала дія сильних стресорів з різко негативною емоційною оцінкою і можливими небажаними згубними наслідками для здоров’я спричиняє формування «дистресу» — прояву найбільш руйнівного стресорного ефекту. Дистрес — стан, при якому людина не в змозі повністю адаптуватися до стресових ситуацій та спричинених ними наслідків. Для нього характерні втома, дратівливість, втрата сексуального потягу до партнера і ряд індивідуальних особливостей. Дистрес може виявлятися у 2 формах — гострій та хронічній. При гострій формі надмірно сильний стресор викликає значний викид катехоламінів і глюкокортикоїдів, підвищення кров’яного тиску і різке пригнічення імунітету. При хронічному дистресі сильний стресор призводить до виснаження резервів цих гормонів. Це створює тло для формування важкої депресії. Дистрес при тривалому перебігу може призводити до неврозів та психозів. Дані багатьох досліджень свідчать, що у хворих на цукровий діабет (ЦД) часто зустрічається низка психологічних проблем і психічних розладів. Для ЦД характерна гіперактивація симпатоадреналової та гіпоталамо-гіпофізарної системи, що сприяє виділенню стресових гормонів і підвищенню нервово-психічної напруги на тлі хронічного стресу. Відзначається двонапрямна взаємодія між ЦД та стресом — з одного боку, стрес сприяє розвитку захворювання, а з іншого боку, при ЦД посилюється стресорна реакція і створюються передумови формування дистресу. Психологічний дистрес є однією з причин зниження фізичної активності людини внаслідок депресивних настроїв, які можуть виникати на тлі ЦД, внаслідок чого перебіг захворювання ускладнюється. Дистрес посилює страждання хворих і впливає на результативність лікування. У хворих на ЦД дистрес виявляється у 2 рази частіше, ніж у людей без ЦД. Дистрес потребує відповідних засобів для його вивчення. Поєднання таких чинників, як наявність ЦД, перенесене захворювання на COVID-19, а також страждань, викликаних війною, можуть сприяти обтяженню розвитку діабетичного дистресу. У публікації розглянуті питання підходів для дослідження дистресу і його особливостей у хворих на ЦД, зокрема, у постковідному періоді та в умовах війни.",

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

      "title": "Understanding vomiting from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine.",
      "abstract": "Vomiting is a common clinical symptom in which the conditions associated with impaired homeostasis and qi flow ascend reversely within the stomach, resulting in the expulsion of the stomach's contents through the mouth. The stomach, located in the middle warmer (also known as Zhong Jiao), is primarily responsible for receiving and digesting food and liquid, and its qi typically flows downward. Various unfavorable conditions associated with the environment, food, mental health, or physiological stress can compromise the stomach, thereby leading to a loss of gastric homeostasis, which often triggers vomiting. However, regardless of external factors or internal weaknesses, the direct cause of vomiting is the loss of gastric homeostasis and the ascending qi flow. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) built its understanding of vomiting from the long-term accumulation of clinical observations and treatments, which were used to gradually improve and develop relevant theories, diagnoses, and treatments. This review paper presents vomiting from the nonaggressive perspective of TCM; specifically, we summarize TCM's unique insights with regard to vomiting across various aspects including its etiology, diagnosis, locations, relationships with other organs, dialectical treatment, and drug and medical characteristics. By revealing the abundance of TCM's theoretical and clinical knowledge concerning vomiting, we attempt to integrate Chinese and western medicines to treat it. In addition, the valuable knowledge that TCM provides with regard to vomiting certainly deserves better understanding to develop and improve modern medicine.",

      "abstract": "Bloating, as a symptom and abdominal distension, as a sign, are both common functional-type complaints and challenging to manage effectively. Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.",

      "title": "Night eating syndrome: implications for severe obesity",
      "abstract": "Night eating syndrome (NES) was first identified in 1955 by Stunkard, a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders (ED). Over the last 20 years considerable progress has been made in defining NES as a significant clinical entity in its own right and it has now been accepted for inclusion in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) due for publication in 2013. NES is considered a dysfunction of circadian rhythm with a disassociation between eating and sleeping. Core criteria include a daily pattern of eating with a significantly increased intake in the evening and/or night time, as manifested by one or both of the following: at least 25% of food intake is consumed after the evening meal or at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week. An important recent addition to core criteria includes the presence of significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Stunkard's team recommend further investigation on the pathogenesis of NES, in particular its relationship with traumatic life events, psychiatric comorbidity, the age of onset of NES and course of NES over time. The relationship between NES and other ED also requires further clarification as night-eaters exhibit some features of other ED; previous guidance to separate NES from other ED may have hindered earlier characterisation of NES. Evidence from European and American studies suggests NES features strongly in populations with severe obesity. The complex interplay between depression, impaired sleep and obesity-related comorbidity in severely obese individuals makes understanding NES in this context even more difficult. This review examines evidence to date on the characterisation of NES and concludes by examining the applicability of current NES criteria to individuals with severe obesity.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

Patients with this condition may have fewer vegetative symptoms (appetite, diurnal mood variation) and more subjective symptoms (self-blame, worry, irritability, lethargy). Minor depressive disorder is more prevalent in primary care than major depressive disorder. Failure to adequately treat this condition may have far-reaching impact on the health, functional status, quality of life, and cost of care for patients who have it. The notion that minor depression requires minor treatment is misleading. Cognitive-behavioral modes of therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants have demonstrated efficacy for primary care patients who have minor depression.",

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of corresponding external sound(s). Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

      "abstract": "People who suffer from eating disorders often have to be treated against their will, perhaps by being detained, perhaps by being forced to eat. In this paper it is argued that whilst forcing compliance is generally acceptable, there may be circumstances under which a sufferer's refusal of consent to treatment should be respected. This argument will hinge upon whether someone in the grip of an eating disorder can actually make competent decisions about their quality of life. If so, then the decision to refuse therapy may be on a par with other decisions to refuse life-prolonging therapy made by sufferers of debilitating chronic, or acute onset terminal illness. In such cases, palliation might justifiably replace aggressive therapy. The argument will also draw heavily on the distinction between competent refusal of therapy and passive euthanasia, and the distinction between incompetence and irrational decisions. Both distinctions will then be applied to decisions to refuse food. The extent to which sufferers from anorexia nervosa can be categorised as either incompetent or irrational will be examined. It against this background that it will be argued that at least some of those who suffer from eating disorders should have their refusals respected, even if they may die as a result.",

It is considered the most common syndrome among gastrointestinal syndromes. Constipation is known to reduce quality of life by causing depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction. It is classified as primary and secondary constipation according to the cause of its occurrence. Secondary constipation occurs due to reasons other than the gastrointestinal system. Primary constipation is basically divided into simple constipation and chronic constipation. Chronic constipation is examined under three subheadings: normal transit time constipation, slow transit time constipation and functional defecation disorders. Functional defecation disorder is characterized by excessive straining, hard stools, a feeling of inadequate evacuation, a feeling of blockage in the anorectal region, the use of manual support, defecation less than 3 times a week, and infrequent defecation without the use of laxatives. It is reported that functional defecation disorders do not respond to standard treatments and that Biofeedback and pelvic floor physiotherapy should be the first step treatment. This review includes a literature review of the physiotherapy methods and their effects, particularly examining functional defecation disorders caused by the pelvic floor muscles and anal sphincters.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are often accompanied by aggressive manifestations that undergo typical dynamics at different stages of the disease. The presence of aggressive phenomena in eating disorders can cause severe maladaptation of patients, cause difficulties in diagnosis, establishing compliance, and prevent the normalization of family relations. Objectives To study the varieties of aggressive manifestations and their changes in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Methods Psychopathological, anamnestic, psychological. Results The most pronounced aggressive symptoms in typical anorexia nervosa are verbal and physical aggression against relatives and close people; feeding younger siblings, parents; threats and suppression of the opinion of relatives in relation to patients. The above aggressive statements and actions occur at the stage of correction and in the initial period of the stage of exhaustion. With deep exhaustion (pronounced cachexia) and in the process of food rehabilitation, aggressive behavior is significantly reduced. In the future, there is criticism of their own aggressive symptoms. In bulimia nervosa, only verbal aggression toward loved ones is noted, especially when they interfere with purifying behavior and massive compulsive overeating. The degree of aggression in bulimia nervosa is significantly less. Conclusions Aggressive manifestations in eating disorders depend on the stage of the disease, the degree of exhaustion and undergo reverse development in the course of therapy. Aggressive phenomena in eating disorders have a significant impact on the clinic, dynamics, outcomes of diseases and the effectiveness of treatment tactics.

      "title": "Postconcussion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Disruption of the compensatory mechanism for severe and long-term hypothyroidism by various causes leads to serious complications, including hypothermia, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and central nervous system dysfunction. The most common causes of myxedema coma are thought to include infectious disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, sedative medicines, exposure to the cold and surgery in patients with poorly controlled hypothyroidism. We present a case of an 82-year-old female presented with complaints of loss of speech for 3 days, complaint of easy fatiguability for 3 days, altered sensorium since 1 day, weakness of both upper and lower limbs for 3 days and the patient attenders complaint of that patient is not taking food and difficult in swallowing since 3 days. In spite of the foregoing, patients with decreased mental status who have undergone thyroid surgery or hypothyroidism should be evaluated for myxedema coma. Additionally, this condition may be caused on by chronic hypothyroidism or by experiencing acute precipitating events like sepsis, a cerebrovascular accident, gastrointestinal bleeding, exposure to cold, trauma, or taking certain medications. A high mortality rate was noted, so patients whose myxedema coma is suspected should start receiving treatment right away.",

      "abstract": "Few of us would say we routinely get enough sleep. Typical sleep duration has reportedly declined over the past half-century or so, probably due to the myriad changes in work and lifestyle that have emerged with our increased reliance on electronic technology. This is problematic, as sleep is critical to so many of our cognitive functions and health. Sleep facilitates memory consolidation, emotional regulation, decision-making and judgment and maintains normal levels of alertness and focus throughout the day. In addition to its effects on cognitive functions, sleep is important for many aspects of physical health and brain repair. During sleep, the brain rids itself of neurotoxins increases the number of brain repairing oligodendrocytes and replenishes depleted energy reserves. Without adequate sleep, people are prone to a host of health related problems, including inflammation, weight gain, and high blood pressure. But while it is easy to point out the problems associated with disrupted or curtailed sleep, it is much less clear how to intervene to improve people’s sleep-wake cycles. Can anything be done to get us back on track?",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "abstract": "Being most common mental health disorder, Major depressive disorder, have affected approximately 350 million people all throughout the world at any time. In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) . Taking consideration prevalence and the suffering, morbidity, dysfunction, and economic burden depression is major public health concern disorder. Depression being more common in women than men, report on global burden of disease suggests the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes is 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, while the estimated one year prevalence to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women. Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention.

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

Clinical manifestations of EIA include diffuse warmth, pruritus, fatigue, erythema, urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, laryngeal edema, and/or cardiovascular collapse if exercise is continued. In FDEIA, when patients consume the food and then exercise, they will develop anaphylaxis; however, patients can consume the food without symptoms or exercise without symptoms if each is done separately. Co-triggers in EIA include food, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol, menstruation, seasonal pollen exposure in those who are sensitized, infection, increased body temperature, and stress. EIA and FDEIA are usually diagnosed clinically. Investigations include controlled exercise challenge in EIA; however, if negative, it does not rule it out. Other tests include skin prick testing and/or specific IgE to suspected food in FDEIA, among other tests. It is important to rule out other possible diagnoses (e.g. mastocytosis).

      "abstract": "La Realidad Virtual como Herramienta Terapéutica en Niños con TDAH&#x0D; &#x0D; El TDAH es una trastorno neurobiológico descrito como un patrón continuo de inatención y/o hiperactividad-impulsividad que impide al niño realizar las actividades diarias. Los niños con TDAH también pueden experimentar dificultades para mantener la atención, la función ejecutiva (habilidad del cerebro para comenzar una actividad, organizarse y llevar a cabo tareas) y la memoria de trabajo (aquella que permite mantener la información temporalmente y manipularla durante un periodo corto de tiempo). &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Los niños con TDAH presentan multiples síntomas y todos ellos tienen un gran impacto en las áreas de funcionamiento del niño (académica, familiar y social). Algunos de esos síntomas son: dificultades para mantener la atención, para seguir instrucciones, parece no escuchar, comete errores por descuido, incapacidad para permanecer sentado mucho tiempo, hablar en exceso, le cuesta esperar su turno, interrumpe a los demás. &#x0D; En la última década, muchos autores han demostrado que las tecnologías de realidad virtual se utilizan cada vez más tanto en el área educativa como en el área de rehabilitación. &#x0D; La Realidad Virtual (RV), es una tecnología que simula un entorno imaginado o real, como un aula, una habitación o un parque. Al usar esta tecnología, los usuarios pueden interactuar y comportarse como lo harían en el mundo real.&#x0D; “Según la última versión del Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Mentales (DSM-V), el TDAH afecta aproximadamente al 5% de los niños\"&#x0D; Los sistemas de RV se caracterizan por la interacción y la inmersión. La interacción entre la persona y el sistema de RV se logra a través de muchos canales sensoriales (vista, oído, tacto y olfato). La inmersión es el grado en que la persona se siente envuelta dentro del sistema. &#x0D; Gracias a estas características la realidad virtual tiene tres ventajas fundamentales en la rehabilitación de niños con TDAH: &#x0D; Por un lado, la flexibilidad, la cual permite individualizar el tratamiento ya que el terapeuta puede controlar el programa para adaptarlo y graduarlo según las necesidades del niño. Por otro lado, la seguridad, ya que es una de las principales preocupaciones de los padres. Los niños con TDAH pueden no tener desarrolladas las habilidades cognitivas necesarias para entender situaciones peligrosas y detectarlas. La RV ofrece entornos realistas y seguros. Por último, la generalización del aprendizaje de un entorno (colegio) a otro (casa) muchas veces es un reto para los terapeutas. Gracias a la RV el niño puede realizar las actividades en un entorno simulado facilitando la transferencia al entorno real. &#x0D; En definitiva, los sistemas de realidad virtual proporcionan al terapeuta un equilibrio entre la flexibilidad y el control del programa de tratamiento. El realismo del entorno simulado ofrece al niño el aprendizaje de habilidades de manera segura y además permite que estas habilidades se transfieran a su vida cotidiana. &#x0D; La RV no sólo es útil en el tratamiento del niño con TDAH si no que tiene también la capacidad de realizar algunas pruebas neuropsicológicas de una manera más fiable, como es el caso de la prueba de rendimiento continuo ( “Continous Performance Test” o CPT por sus siglas en inglés), prueba muy utilizada tanto en la práctica clínica como en la investigación del TDAH que evalúa la atención sostenida y selectiva y la impulsividad. &#x0D; Numerosos estudios concluyen que la RV mejora la memoria, la función ejecutiva y los diferentes tipos de atención (atención focalizada), la atención sostenida, la atención selectiva, la atención alternante y la atención dividida) en niños con TDAH. &#x0D; Dependiendo del tipo de interacción entre el niño y el sistema existen distintos tipos de sistemas de RV. Sistemas de gestos, sistemas basados en el sistema táctil y sistemas enfocados en la retroalimentación. &#x0D; Por un lado, los sistemas con interacción basada en gestos son aquellos que han incorporado cámaras que capturan el movimiento o los gestos del niños de manera que el niño interacciona en tiempo real con los objetos virtuales. Por otro, los sistemas con interacción basada en el sistema táctil, que constan de dispositivos como ratones, joysticks o pantallas táctiles. Por último, los sistemas de interacción enfocada en la retroalimentación, que utilizan la RV como el medio para proporcionar un refuerzo. &#x0D; “La Realidad Virtual es una herramienta útil para la evaluación y tratamiento de niños con TDAH ”&#x0D; La RV se puede aplicar a niños con otras patologías muy frecuentes en poblaciones pediátricas como la parálisis cerebral o el autismo, donde la RV ayudará a mejorar déficits motores que afectan a las funciones de las extremidades superiores e inferiores y al control postural en el caso de la Parálisis Cerebral (PC) y dificultades en la socialización y comunicación en el caso del Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA). &#x0D; En definitiva, la RV permite que los niños puedan aprender y desarrollar habilidades específicas para ellos en un entorno seguro para después transferirlo a un entorno real y además estar en un proceso de continuo aprendizaje gracias a la posibilidad de adaptación y graduación del programa por parte del terapeuta.&#x0D;",

Narcoleptic symptoms can be developed from various medical or neurological disorders. A 17-year-old male patient admitted for the evaluation of EDS which started three-month ago. He slept more than 18 hours a day with cataplexy and hypnagogic hallucination. He was obese with body mass index (BMI) of 30.4 kg/. After admission he was newly diagnosed to the thyrotoxicosis. T3 391.2 ng/dL (60-181), free T4 4.38 ng/dL (0.89-1.76), TSH /mL (0.35-5.5) were measured. His pulse rate ranged 70-90 beats per minute and blood pressure ranged 150/100-120/70 mmHg. Polysomnography revealed many fragmentations in sleep with many positional changes (81 times/h). Sleep onset latency was 33.5 min, sleep efficiency was 47.9%, and REM latency from sleep onset was delayed to 153.6 min. REM sleep percent was increased to 27.1%. Periodic limb movement index was 13.4/h. In the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), average sleep latency was 0.4 min and there were noted 3 SOREMPs (Sleep Onset REM sleep period) on 5 trials. We couldn't discriminate the obvious sleep-wake pattern in the actigraph and his HLA DQB1 type was negative. His thyroid function improved following treatment with methimazole and propranolol. Vital sign maintained within normal range. Cataplexy was controlled with venlafaxine 75 mg. Subjective night sleep continuity and PLMS were improved with clonazepam 0.5 mg, but the EDS were partially improved with modafinil 200-400 mg. Thyrotoxicosis might give confounding role when we were evaluating the EDS, though sleep fragmentation was one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but enormous amount of it made us think of the influence of thyroid hormone. The loss of sleep-wake cycle, limited improvement of EDS to the stimulant treatmen, and the cataplexy not supported by HLA DQB1 should be answered further. We still should rule out idiopathic hypersomnia and measuring CSF hypocretin level would be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was once considered rare1, but recent studies indicate a prevalence of 1% to 2% in children and adolescents.2 The age of onset of OCD is earlier in boys than in girls3, with the mean age of onset reported between eight and 11 years.4 Since OCD is relatively common, and can cause significant morbidity for the child/adolescent, it is important to identify and treat in a timely fashion. Obsessions are repetitive, intrusive thoughts, images, or ideas that are viewed as distressing to the individual. Compulsions are repetitive actions or mental acts that an individual performs to undo an obsession, and the individual recognizes that the action is absurd. The criteria for OCD involves the child/adolescent spending more than an hour a day on the obsession/compulsion, and/or it interferes with functioning at home, school, or the community.5 Young children may not view either obsessions or compulsions as abnormal, and they many not realize that a compulsion cannot undo an obsession.6",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Hakekat kehidupan modem yang penuh persaingan merupakan stresor bagi setiap individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi secara terus menerus akan melampaui ambang batas adaptasi individu sehingga menimbulkan kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut sebagai distress. Banyak kelainan saluran pencernaan, seperti gangguan motilitas usus dan peningkatan kerentanan mukosa terhadap infeksi yang terjadi pada kondisi stres. Telah dilaporkan 567 dari 1000 penderita dengan keluhan nyeri perut di rumah sakit North Carolina,16% diantaranya mengalami gangguan organik (medis), dan 10% mengalami gangguan non organik. (fungsional). Lebih dari 40% penderita dengan gangguan fungsional diberi pengobatan simtomatis yang belum berdasar atas patogenesis yang jelas atau pengobatan yang tidak rasional. Bila hal tersebut dibiarkan berlanjut maka akan timbul berbagai komplikasi dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas. Komplikasi ini akan semakin menyulitkan pengobatan rasional pada kelainan di saluran pencernaan makanan. Di mukosa saluran pencernaan makanan terdapat dua macam ketahanan, yaitu ketahanan alami (innate) dan ketahanan yang didapat (adaptive). Motilitas atau peristaltik usus merupakan ketahanan usus yang alami, mengontrol perlekatan dan kolonisasi bakteri, serta mempercepat pengeluaran imunogen dari lumen usus. Respons imun mukosal merupakan ketahanan usus yang didapat. bertujuan untuk mempertahankan tubuh terhadap patogen dan melakukan toleransi terhadap imunogen dalam makanan dan flora normal. Perubahan motilitas yang disertai dengan perubahan kepekaan usus terhadap patogen pada kondisi stres menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan antara peningkatan motilitas dan modulasi respons imun. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan mukosal tersebut belum dapat diielaskan. Saat ini telah berkembang ilmu yang mempelajari modulasi fungsi sistem imun pada kondisi stres, yaitu psikoneuroimunologi. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui htipothalamic pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menvebabkan peningkatan Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) hipotalamus. yang memicu aktivitas aksis HPA. Selain itu CRF dapat ditangkap langsung oleh reseptor CRF-Rl limfosit mukosa, sinyal stres diterima oleh limfosit sehingga perilaku limfosit berubah. Limfosit di mukosa diketahui selain menghasilkan sitokin IFN- IL-10 (Interferon- Interleukin-10) yang berperan pada modulasi respons imun. pada kondisi stres juga menghasilkan peptida SP VIP ( Substance P Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) yang berperan pada motilitas usus. Secara konseptual perubahan perilaku limfosit tersebut akan memodulasi respons imun (IgA_ lgG IgM). Namun sejauh ini mekanisme modulasi tersebut belum dapat dijelaskan. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme imunopatobiogenesis respons imun mukosal yang stres. Penelitian menggunakan paradigms psikoneuroimunologi berkonsep sel imunokompeten yang stres, dengan rancangan separate sample pretest-posttest control group dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor renjatan listrik (5-30mA) dengan alat Electric Foot Shock , 7 dan 14 hari pada hewan coba, Rattans norvegicus strain Wistar, jantan, berumur 3-4 bulan, berat badan antara 150-175 gram. 60 ekor tikus Wistar yang homogen. dibagi menjadi 6 kelompok secara alokasi random (Random Assignment) berdasar atas bilangan random, yaitu kelompok pretest 7 14, kelompok kontrol 7 14 dan kelompok posttest 7 14. Variabel tergantung adalah kortisol, limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- , IL-l0, sel plasma penghasil IgA, IgG dan IgM. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 7 hari terjadi peningkatan jumlah limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- , IL-10, jumlah sel plasma penghasil IgA, IgG, kadar kortisol darah dan penurunan jumlah sel plasma penghasil IgM. Pada respons imun yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 14 hari terjadi penurunan limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- IL-10, sel plasma penghasil IgA; IgG, IgM dan peningkatan kadar kortisol darah (namun mulai menurun). Berdasar pola diskriminan dan kerangka konsep penelitian maka modulasi respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat renjatan listrik 7 hari meningkatkan fungsi CRF, sinyal tersebut dirambatkan, baik secara langsung ke limfosit mukosal maupun melalui aksis HPA. Sinyal yang dirambatkan melalui jalur CRF–CRF¬Rlmeningkatkan produksi SP dan VIP oleh limfosit mukosal. Peningkatan fungsi SP dan VIP, selain meningkatkan fungsi IFN-y dan pembentukan imunoglobulin (IgA dan IgG), juga potensial meningkatkan motilitas usus. Modulasi respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 14 hari, masih terjadi peningkatan CRF, sinyal tersebut terutama dirambatkan secara langsung melalui CRF–CRF-RI, dan didapatkan penurunan fungsi SP dan VIP serta peningkatan fungsi IFN- dan IL-10 dengan besar yang tidak lama. Penurunan fungsi VIP yang jauh lebih besar daripada penurunan fungsi SP menyebabkan dominasi fungsi SP, sehingga peningkatan fungsi IFN- , IL-10 dan dominasi SP masih cukup kuat untuk mempertahankan fungsi IgA. Namun demikian penurunan SP dan VIP tersebut berpotensi untuk menurunkan motilitas usus. Dapat disimpulkan, pada stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik 7 had, kedua ketahanan mukosal bersinergi melakukan upaya ketahanan mukosal, sedangkan pada stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik 14 hari terjadi kelelahan motilitas usus lebih awal daripada respons imun.",

      "title": "Ruminative Coping with Depression",
      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

The first way, the time factor, however, applied by the WHO is somewhat more complicated than that of the APA. The first time factor used by the WHO concerns the development of symptoms (the time-interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks). And the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the type of the subgroup: the total duration of the disorder in the subgroups with schizophrenic symptoms (F23.1: Acute Polymorphic Psychotic Disorders with Symptoms of Schizophrenia, F23.2: Acute Schizophrenia-like Psychotic Disorders) must not exceed 1 month. This is also valid for the unspecified type (F23.8).",

      "title": "The Neuromuscular Fatigue-Induced Loss of Muscle Force Control",
      "abstract": "Neuromuscular fatigue is characterised not only by a reduction in the capacity to generate maximal muscle force, but also in the ability to control submaximal muscle forces, i.e., to generate task-relevant and precise levels of force. This decreased ability to control force is quantified according to a greater magnitude and lower complexity (temporal structure) of force fluctuations, which are indicative of decreased force steadiness and adaptability, respectively. The “loss of force control” is affected by the type of muscle contraction used in the fatiguing exercise, potentially differing between typical laboratory tests of fatigue (e.g., isometric contractions) and the contractions typical of everyday and sporting movements (e.g., dynamic concentric and eccentric contractions), and can be attenuated through the use of ergogenic aids. The loss of force control appears to relate to a fatigue-induced increase in common synaptic input to muscle, though the extent to which various mechanisms (afferent feedback, neuromodulatory pathways, cortical/reticulospinal pathways) contribute to this remains to be determined. Importantly, this fatigue-induced loss of force control could have important implications for task performance, as force control is correlated with performance in a range of tasks that are associated with activities of daily living, occupational duties, and sporting performance.",

Regular response is rare, but so is repeated non-response. Even if one or several waking therapies remain ineffective, further attempts can eventually result in marked antidepressive effects.

      "title": "Abstract WP296: Prospective e-Diary Captures Elusive Oost Stroke-Symptoms as Patterned and Cyclical",
      "abstract": "Introduction: In the post-acute phase of a stroke, some of the most difficult symptoms (fatigue, headache, cognitive lapses, emotional outbursts, somato-sensory changes and dizziness) are often elusive and difficult to capture and quantify. Retrospective reports/scales lack sensitivity and specificity for neuro-psychological behavior intervention (BI) as a supplement to medication management. We hypothesized that symptoms occur in cycles, provoked by an activity pattern or circadian rhythm, which could be a focus for a BI. Method: Post-stroke patients were prospectively recruited to use electronic diary (e-diary) to quantify a primary symptom 3 times per day (TD), for each day of the week (DW), up to 12 weeks (n=30). Results: Cluster analysis shows a majority of patients (89%) to have a statistically significant cyclical pattern, specifically: 63% DW; 48% TD, 17% both; 89% either DW or TD, as shown in Fig 1. DW cyclical patterns can be simple (one high phase/week), or complex (2/week) with a relative risk of high to low phases of 2 to 1 or greater. A few patients (7%) demonstrated a “random” fixed pattern (i.e., non-cyclical 2 to 1 or greater high-low DW variations). Conclusion: Common cyclical patterns of elusive symptom expression post stroke can be reliably quantified and analyzed by prospective e-diary, like a “fitbit” for the brain. Recognition of these patterns for elusive symptoms can serve as the basis for formulating more effective BI as a supplement, or alternative, to medication management post stroke.",

      "title": "The long-term consequences of exposure to adverse experience on muscle physiology",
      "abstract": "Physical inactivity is a growing burden among society and is especially prominent in groups with psychological trauma including adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The prevalence of ACEs and PTSD are high across society and can considerably increase the risk of developing the deadliest chronic diseases through elevated inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in energy balance. The sedentary lifestyle can contribute to the same maladaptive physiological states and chronic diseases risk as ACEs and PTSD, and thus may be a mediating factor. However, it is currently not clear how exposures to adverse experiences may disrupt biological processes in manners that contribute to persistent physical inactivity. This thesis will detail some findings in rats on how exposure to adverse experiences might generate persistent maladaptive responses to muscle physiology that could contribute to persistent physical activity deficits. To that end, young adult male rats were exposed to a single episode of uncontrollable tail shocks (Stress, N=12) or left undisturbed in home cages (No Stress, N=12). Forty-eight hours later, half of the rats from each stress condition received free access to running wheels (Running) or remained in cages without running wheels (Sedentary) for 42 days. At the conclusion of the study, gastrocnemius muscle was taken, and Western Blots were utilized to measure protein biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and energy balance among the rats including HSP70, SIRT1, TNF-a, AMPk and total pAMPK, and IL-6. Results show that stress exposure caused a 4-fold decreased in wheel running distance that persisted for the entire 42-day access to wheels. Stress-induced deficits in wheel running were associated with a trend towards elevated TNF-a and lowered IL-6 in the gastrocnemius muscle. These data suggest exposure to adverse experience may generate persistent changes to inflammatory factors in muscle that may chronically impair physical activity output. Future studies are required for a more complete analysis of the immunological pathways involved, as it could be of central importance to understanding the development of sedentary lifestyles following exposure to adverse events.",

      "title": "Suicidal ideation resulting from severe Inflammatory Bowel Disease symptoms",
      "abstract": "IntroductionInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased prevalence of depression when compared to the general population. Studies have suggested that depression may be more pronounced in the early period of diagnosis, with the strongest association occurring within one year of diagnosis. It has also been documented that depression can amplify symptoms, decrease medication compliance, alter self-perception and worsen individuals' adaptation to their disease. It is recommended that all IBD patients be screened for depression. We present 2 cases of patients with IBD who were hospitalized with suicidal ideation at the time or shortly following their IBD diagnosis. These cases emphasize the need to screen for depression with assessment for severity.Case 1: A 45 year old man was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation with a plan. His psychiatric interview revealed that he was profoundly depressed as a result of ‘years' of chronic, frequent (50-60 times daily) diarrhea with blood, urgency, nocturnal awakening and fecal incontinence which had worsened in recent months. He had no history of depression or psychiatric disorders and a previous history of cocaine dependency was not thought to contribute to his depression. Gastroenterology consult was obtained and following an evaluation he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine, mesalamine, and tapering steroids (with discontinuation) resulted in clinical improvement of his gastrointestinal symptoms and resolution of his depression.Case 2: A 37 year old woman without significant past medical history transferred her care to our institution and presented to Gastroenterology clinic for a second opinion of rectal pain and bleeding following a hemorrrhoidectomy. Medical records revealed that she presented to an outside surgeon with complaints of hemorrhoids. Rectal fissures and a large hemorrhoid complex were noted and she underwent a fissurectomies and a hemorrhoidectomy which resulted in chronic fecal drainage and incontinence. A rectal exam under anesthesia revealed rectal ulcerations and a large nonhealing wound in the posterior midline which extended through her internal and part of her external sphincter. A colonoscopy revealed pancolitis with biopsies demonstrating chronic active colitis and noncaseating granulomas. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Two weeks following the diagnosis she was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation. Psychiatric interview revealed that her depression was related to her gastrointestinal symptoms and new Crohn's diagnosis. Improvement of her symptoms with oral and topical mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine and tapering steroids has resulted in improvement of her depression. The psychiatrists did not believe that her steroid therapy precipitated or exacerbated her depression. She is not maintained on antidepressants.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Este tratamiento del dolor, ya puede ser una manifestacion mas como respuesta a la devastacion psicotica, ya un efecto de la ingesta de la sustancia. Al no ser posible con los recursos actuales determinar rapidamente cuando se trata de una cosa o de la otra, sucede que, en ocasiones, son diagnosticados como psicoticos pacientes que no lo son, o viceversa, con la consecuente perdida de tiempo, de recursos y con riesgo de provocar efectos iatrogenicos. Es un objetivo de esta investigacion la deteccion precoz de esta diferencia. De alli que en nuestra hipotesis planteemos lo siguiente: El mecanismo de supresion toxica del dolor que contribuye al corrimiento del umbral fisico frente al mismo en consumidores de pasta base de cocaina (paco) es analogo al tratamiento del dolor en cuadros de crisis psicoticas\r\nPalabras clave\r\nPaco Toxicomanias Dolor Cuerpo\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nDIAGNOSTIC DIFFERENTIAL (NEUROSIS - PSYCHOSIS) OF THE WAY OF TREATMENT OF THE PAIN IN CONSUMERS OF PASTA BASE OF COCAINE In consumers of Paco the shift of the threshold to the physical pain in pursuit of the flash of the consumption contributes - among other things - to an accelerated and noticeable deterioration of the body. In tables of psychosis is an observable the exceed the thresholds of selfpreservation in relation to pain, as there is no body. This treatment of the pain, already it can be one more manifestation as response to the psychotic devastation, already an effect of the ingestion of the substance. On not having been possible with the current resources to determine rapidly when it is a question of a thing or of other one, it happens that, in occasions, they are diagnosed as psychotic patients who are not, or vice versa, with the consistent loss of time and resources. It is an aim of this investigation the precocious detection of this difference. Of there that in our hypothesis we raise the following thing: The mechanism of toxic suppression of the pain that contributes to the landslide of the physical threshold opposite to the same one in consumers of Paco is analogous to the treatment of the pain in psychotic crises.\r\nKey words\r\nPaco Toxicomanias Pain body",

One ought to make this diagnosis with its serious consequences only under the following conditions: --when it is a case of a mostly partial trauma of a nerve with considerable intermingling of sympathetic fibres; --when the pains have a burning and primarily superficial character; --when the pain appear soon (hours, mostly days or weeks, more rarely months afterward) after the trauma; --when the pains are accompanied by considerable vasovegetative symptoms (cold sweats, cyanosis, hyperhidrosis and others). Secondary algodystrophic changes (muscle, joints, bones, and skin) are to be considered. In quantitatively judging the effects, an over-evaluation, as well as an underevaluation, is to be avoided by all means.

Although the exact cause of bulimia nervosa is unknown, it is most likely complex. The binge-like conduct linked to this illness may be influenced by the anomalies in interoceptive function, notably of the insula. Although the exact origin is unknown, scientists think a combination of genetic, biochemical, psychological, social, and behavioral variables is to blame.

The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is still poorly understood. There are no organic causes found nor are there any functional changes observed that correlate with symptom occurrence and intensity and which could offer a satisfactory explanation for the symptoms and a basis for successful therapy. Mechanisms discussed include a disturbance of gastric motility and emptying, an increased sensitivity of the stomach to or hypersecretion of gastric acid, and infection by Helicobacter pylori. Recent research indicates visceral hypersensitivity of the gastroduodenal region to mechanical (distension) and chemical (nutrients or neuromodulators) stimulation to be a major factor in the aetiology of functional dyspepsia, potentially offering an explanation why dyspeptic symptoms are often related to food intake. The occurrence of dyspeptic symptoms in relation to food ingestion frequently prompts the gastroenterologist to the diagnosis of a motility disorder and subsequent therapy with prokinetic drugs. These substances may result in an improvement of gastric emptying, but not necessarily symptoms. It is apparent that the incompletely understood pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is one of the main reasons for the lack of an effective therapy for this common condition.",

      "title": "Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Clinicians have defined the term psychosis in different ways over the last two centuries. This term has been used variously as a synonym for \"gross impairment in reality testing\" or \"loss of ego boundaries\" sufficient to interfere with the capacity to meet the demands of daily life; to denote the presence of delusions and/or hallucinations; to indicate a category of psychiatric illnesses (\"the psychoses\"); to describe the severity of delusional and \"thought disorder\" symptomatology; and, more recently, to refer to a spectrum of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and motoric symptoms and signs, each of which varies in character and severity in any given patient (Arciniegas 2015). Briefly reviewing the history of the term psychosis , Arciniegas (2015) notes that by the mid-1990s, clinicians most commonly used the term to define a population of patients with severe social and personal impairment, characterized by social withdrawal and an inability to perform typical daily activities at home or in the workplace. He also notes that the American Psychiatric Association (APA; American Psychiatric Association 2013) and the World Health Organization (WHO; World Health Organization 1992) currently apply narrow definitions of psychosis to the diagnoses they recognize. Their definitions of psychosis require the presence of delusions, insight-impaired hallucinations, or both. Impaired reality testing remains central conceptually to psychosis in both of these definitions, where delusions are fixed false beliefs that are maintained despite evidence contrary to them and where hallucinations (perceptions occurring in the absence of corresponding external or somatic stimuli) are experienced without insight into their pathological nature. Although the APA and WHO acknowledge that \"formal thought disorder\" (i.e., thought blocking, thought derailment, severely disorganized thinking, or some combination of these disturbances) occurs commonly among persons with psychotic disorders, they also recognize that mildly disorganized speech is common and diagnostically nonspecific. Accordingly, their definitions of psychosis permit thought disorder to supplant the requirement for delusions and insight-impaired hallucinations only when formal thought disorder is accompanied by grossly disorganized behavior, catatonia (for schizophrenia and schizophreniform and brief psychotic and schizoaffective disorders), and/or negative symptoms (for schizophrenia and schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders but not brief psychotic disorder), and when the severity of thought disorder substantially impairs effective communication. For the purposes of this chapter, then, psychosis will be used as recommended by the APA and WHO and will refer narrowly to the presence of delusions or hallucinations without insight. This use will apply to psychosis arising as an idiopathic psychiatric disorder (primary psychoses) as well as psychosis developing in the context of a neurological condition (secondary psychoses). Clinical tradition in psychiatry and neurology generally divides the psychoses into two broad categories: primary and secondary. Primary psychoses define the schizophrenia spectrum disorders (e.g., delusional disorder, schizotypal disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) and arise in mood disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder) and other idiopathic psychiatric disorders. Secondary psychoses , in contrast, are associated with developmental, degenerative, and acquired neurological conditions such as adrenoleukodystrophy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body diseases, stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalidities, among others. As the science of psychosis evolves, it is increasingly clear that division of psychoses into primary and secondary types is artificial, at best. However, this division, nevertheless, remains useful for characterizing clinical phenotypes and ensuring that the underlying illness is optimally treated even when the psychosis itself must be a target of intervention. Although phenomenology does not always reliably differentiate between primary and secondary psychoses, certain differences are generally apparent. The primary psychoses usually (although not invariably) begin in late adolescence or early adulthood and often feature a family history of phenomenologically similar psychoses. The secondary psychoses usually (although not invariably) begin in late adulthood and are associated with a known or identifiable neurological illness. Hallucinations are predominantly (although not exclusively) auditory in the primary psychoses, and delusions are often bizarre and complex. In the secondary psychoses, hallucinations are more often visual, and delusions are often simpler and more contextually or environmentally dependent (e.g., delusions of theft in a patient with AD as memory impairment and executive dysfunction develop). Treatment of the primary psychoses usually requires antipsychotic medications, whereas treating the underlying disease process may be sufficient to diminish or ameliorate delusions and hallucinations in some (but not all) of the secondary psychoses.",

A razón de lo anteriormente expuesto se observa que, la AE es un término más complejo de lo que hasta ahora se ha definido, y que requiere una mayor reflexión, estudio e integración de los nuevos conocimientos en su acepción teórica y delimitación conceptual, que permita interpretaciones más acertadas de las implicaciones de este tipo de alimentación con miras de futuras investigaciones e intervenciones en favor de la salud física y psicológica que estén relacionadas con la AE.",

      "title": "The symptom of generalised fatigue",
      "abstract": "What is fatigue? It is a sensation that we all feel at times and which has a variety of synonyms such as tiredness, exhaustion, and weariness.1 In this article we are concerned with a general feeling of fatigue or exhaustion and not with fatigue specific to a part of the body; this is sometimes called central as opposed to peripheral fatigue.2 Although one may interpret a complaint of \"fatigue\" as meaning whatever the patient wants it to mean, it is useful to apply more precision by exploring exactly what the patient means by the term. For example, to differentiate the core concept of fatigue as a lack of ability to initiate or sustain activities because of a feeling of lack of energy, from other meanings such as the \"lack of interest and motivation\" that is typical of depression, and the \"tendency to fall asleep\" that is typical of sleep disorders. When is fatigue abnormal? Fatigue as a symptom must be differentiated from normal tiredness. Given that the severity of fatigue is continuously distributed in the population (fig 1), we need to draw some kind of cutoff to define fatigue of clinically important severity, in the same way that we do for blood pressure and depression. One approach is to define this as fatigue that has persisted for a period of time (say a month or more) and that is of sufficient severity to interfere with the patient's activities or to be otherwise severely troublesome. A patient with fatigue of this severity and duration may then be referred to as \"a case\" of clinically significant fatigue. Figure 1 The distribution of the complaint of fatigue in the population.

Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "EDITORIAL: Why do young women (donors) faint?",
      "abstract": "In humans, tolerance to orthostasis requires the successful integration of multiple elements of cardiovascular control. Syncope or near-syncope may occur when there is an abnormally large postural decrease in central blood volume, cardiac filling pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output or inadequate (or inappropriate) neurohumoral reflex responses to orthostasis, primarily tachycardia and vasoconstriction.1 Young women are more susceptible to orthostatic intolerance compared to similarly aged men; this sex difference is especially dramatic under hypovolemic conditions when circulating blood volume is reduced. For example, postflight syncope or near-syncope is greatest in women astronauts,2,3 and orthostatic tolerance decreases are greater in women than men after a period of head-down bed rest (i.e., simulated microgravity exposure)4 or after acute dehydration.5 Additionally, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (also called chronic orthostatic intolerance, in which patients are unable to stand or remain upright for prolonged periods of time due to intolerable light-headedness, weakness, and near-syncope) affects primarily young women,6 with perturbed blood volume regulation and reduced plasma volume in many of these patients.7 Circulating blood volume has a profound effect on arterial pressure during orthostasis in humans.8,9 Individuals with reduced vascular volumes exhibit subnormal cardiac filling pressure and the capacity to buffer orthostatic reductions in central blood volume is limited.8 In this issue of TRANSFUSION, Kamel and coworkers10 provide strong evidence of orthostatic intolerance in young women after blood donation. In this large retrospective study, the authors assessed 793,293 donors from 15 blood centers and identified risk factors for moderate or severe adverse reactions to blood donation. For the sake of clarity, we will use the term “neurally mediated” rather than “vasovagal” to describe these reactions because the relative contribution of sympathetic withdrawal (leading to vasodilation) and increased vagal tone (leading to bradycardia and reduced cardiac output) may be quite variable among individuals who faint. They found that low estimated blood volume, youth, and first-time donor status are major risk factors for both immediate and delayed reactions, while female sex is a better predictor of a delayed neurally mediated reaction. What are the clinical implications of these findings? As the authors state, the identified characteristics may shape policy and procedures intended to reduce the risks of adverse reactions to blood donation; understanding the physiologic basis of delayed reactions may lead to the development of appropriate interventions to reduce their likelihood. The observations made by Kamel and coworkers10 are novel. However, the mechanisms underlying sex differences in orthostatic tolerance are not completely understood. It is possible that certain sex-specific factors such as differences in some hormonal levels, which may affect the neurohumoral regulation of arterial pressure, or physical characteristics such as a smaller and less distensible heart,11 may affect orthostatic blood pressure control. Sex differences in arterial pressure have been suggested to be associated with the sex hormones. Among these, estrogen is proposed to be responsible for the lower blood pressure in premenopausal women. Meyer and colleagues12 showed previously that estrogen replacement attenuated resistance artery adrenergic sensitivity via endothelial vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostaglandins in female rats. It was also found that estrogen supplementation selectively attenuated vasoconstrictor responses in perimenopausal women.13 Conversely, recent data from healthy young women demonstrated that the fluctuations of female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone during the normal menstrual cycle did not alter arterial pressure and peripheral vasoconstriction in the upright posture,14,15 suggesting that the relationship between blood pressure and endogenous levels of sex hormones is complex and is probably affected by other factors. Sympathetic neural control plays an important role in arterial pressure maintenance through peripheral vasoconstriction during orthostasis in humans.16,17 When this compensatory mechanism fails or is overwhelmed, blood pressure will drop and syncope may occur.17 Sex differences in orthostatic tolerance have been suggested to be related to sympathetic neural control. One previous study with the microneurographic technique to directly measure intraneural efferent sympathetic nerve discharges demonstrated that healthy young men and women had comparable sympathetic neural responses during acute upright posture in normovolemic and hypovolemic conditions; in addition, vasoconstrictor responses to tilting were similar between sexes under both conditions.5 Recently, it was found that healthy young men and women had comparable sympathetic neural and vasoconstrictor responses during prolonged (i.e., 45 min) orthostasis.18 These results do not support the notion that an impairment of sympathetic neural control contributes to the high prevalence of orthostatic intolerance in young women. Orthostatic intolerance is the main circulatory expression of chronic failure of autonomic neural control of cardiovascular and sympathetic responses, but can also occur without apparent autonomic dysfunction, for example, in the setting of a decreased blood volume as occurs with blood donation.19 Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a key regulator of plasma volume, particularly in response to sustained orthostasis and/or hypovolemia,20 it may be possible that young women have less activation of this system in hypovolemic conditions than men. An earlier study by Vernikos and colleagues21 showed that young women exhibited greater plasma renin activity and aldosterone responses to standing before and larger aldosterone responses to standing after 7 days of 6° head-down bed rest compared with their male counterparts; these studies suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is actually greater, rather than smaller, in women than men in the face of “cardiovascular deconditioning” and hypovolemia. Young women usually have lower systolic pressure but similar diastolic pressure compared with young men,5,14 which is predominantly attributable to a smaller stroke volume.5,11 It has been found that cardiac size and/or mass is smaller in healthy young women than men even when normalized to body mass.22 A sex-specific smaller, and thus less distensible, left ventricle in women may result in a larger reduction in stroke volume for a decrease in cardiac filling pressure as a function of the Frank-Starling mechanism, leading to an excessive reduction in stroke volume during orthostasis11 and ultimately causing intolerance. It is highly likely that the smaller and less distensible heart in women increases their sensitivity to fluid shifts and/or a loss of blood volume. Numerous studies have demonstrated one clear sex-specific hemodynamic difference during orthostasis, namely, stroke volume, is smaller in women compared with men. This sex difference can be exaggerated under hypovolemic conditions.5 Stroke volume is the key variable in the heart rate–stroke volume–total peripheral resistance (triple product of arterial pressure) relation that is directly affected by gravity.23 Moreover, stroke volume is a direct, linear function of central blood volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.8 Results from our laboratory and others have provided strong evidence that women and men have comparable vasoconstrictor responses during orthostasis. Ultimately, orthostatic hypotension and syncope occur more in women because this vasoconstrictor reserve can be overwhelmed by reduced stroke volume and impaired cardiac filling during hypovolemic “shock.” The latter may also have contributed to reflex sympathetic withdrawal as the final common pathway to neurally mediated syncope in many patients. In the study by Kamel and coworkers,10 women and men donated their blood at the same “standard” amount (i.e., 525 mL). Therefore, the percentage of blood loss would have been greater in women than in men, since women generally have a smaller blood volume. Indeed, this practice seems to us to be the most glaring problem and the one which places small people (who are more often women) at greatest risk for a delayed, hemodynamically mediated faint. One simple approach would be to reduce the amount of blood donated by small women. However this solution is practically quite difficult since blood collection sets come with fixed amounts of preservative and anticoagulants that must be precisely matched to the donated volume. Even if the donations could be set to three different sizes: small, medium, or large, based on specific estimated blood volume cut points, this proposal would be preferable to the current “one size fits all” system, although we realize that there may be economic, procedural, and therapeutic hurdles. Other approaches are possible that might mitigate the risk of a delayed reaction based on the informative work by Kamel and colleagues. For example, the finding that first-time donors are most susceptible suggests that donor education may be beneficial. Development of printed, video, or electronic-based instructions that describe the symptoms associated with cerebral hypoperfusion or a neurally mediated reaction could be provided to first-time donors and perhaps repeat donors if they are small women or have had a previous reaction. Given the fact that most of the delayed reactions occur in young donors, it might even be possible to link the education materials to a cell phone attachment or personal video/music player. Maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, or hand-grip exercise with a rubber ball could be demonstrated and checked before leaving the area after blood donation to improve orthostatic tolerance and to reduce adverse reactions in donors (see http://www.stars.org.uk/patient-info/treatment-options/managing-your-syncope for details).24 Other simple strategies like increasing dietary salt and water intake and elevating the head of the bed at night during sleep 1 to 2 weeks after donation to expand plasma volume and blood volume could be helpful. It should be emphasized that drinking before blood donation, when neurohumoral volume regulatory mechanisms are operating to maintain the status quo,25 may not be as helpful as salt and water consumption begun during the donation and extended aggressively into the early recovery period. The practice of providing snacks that are predominantly sweet and carbohydrate based should perhaps be replaced with salty snacks combined with fluid/electrolyte replacement as noted by the authors. These hypotheses could be and should be tested in prospectively designed trials. Results obtained from these trials may lead to revision of the AABB guidelines and FDA requirements. In summary Kamel and colleagues provide important new data about fainting after blood donation, emphasizing a problem that occurs perhaps more commonly than previously recognized and with substantial morbidity. Fortunately, this informative analysis may lead the way toward developing creative approaches to limiting the occurrence of syncope in this setting and making the process of blood donation safer for all.

Compulsive behaviours resemble stereotypic movements seen in animals or cultural rituals. Cognitively, anticipating potential future risk scenarios may help in minimising threat, suggesting that obsessivecompulsive disorder may be a by-product of foresight. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is often linked to life events that require heightened vigilance for threat, including sexual maturation (puberty), pregnancy, and childbirth. While most individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder follow a ‘slow’ life-history strategy, cases with increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control seem to pursue a ‘fast’ life-history strategy.",

      "title": "Fatigue and brain arousal in patients with major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is considered a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), yet the term lacks specificity. It can denote a state of increased sleepiness and lack of drive (i.e., downregulated arousal) as well as a state of high inner tension and inhibition of drive with long sleep onset latencies (i.e., upregulated arousal), the latter typically found in depression. It has been proposed to differentiate fatigue along the dimension of brain arousal. We investigated whether such stratification within a group of MDD patients would reveal a subgroup with distinct clinical features. Using an automatic classification of EEG vigilance stages, an arousal stability score was calculated for 15-min resting EEGs of 102 MDD patients with fatigue. 23.5% of the patients showed signs of hypoarousal with EEG patterns indicating drowsiness or sleep; this hypoaroused subgroup was compared with remaining patients (non-hypoaroused subgroup) concerning self-rated measures of depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep. The hypoaroused subgroup scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory items “loss of energy” ( Z = − 2.13, p = 0.033; ɳ 2 = 0.044, 90% CI 0.003–0.128) and “concentration difficulty” ( Z = − 2.40, p = 0.017; ɳ 2 = 0.056, 90% CI 0.009–0.139), and reported higher trait and state sleepiness ( p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the non-hypoaroused group. The non-hypoaroused subgroup, in contrast, reported more frequently the presence of suicidal ideation (Chi 2 = 3.81, p = 0.051; ɳ 2 = 0.037, 90% CI 0.0008–0.126). In this study, we found some evidence that stratifying fatigued MDD patients by arousal may lead to subgroups that are pathophysiologically and clinically more homogeneous. Brain arousal may be a worth while target in clinical research for better understanding the mechanisms underlying suicidal tendencies and to improve treatment response.",

After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9.

      "title": "Depressão e comorbilidade: Um caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

Fatigue frequently presents early in PD, and its prevalence increases with disease progression, affecting up to 60% of patients. Fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is often associated with other nonmotor symptoms, including sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Only a few reports have been published on the treatment of fatigue in PD (methylphenidate, levodopa, and pramipexole). Further well-designed studies, including physiotherapy, are necessary to develop more effective treatments for PD-associated fatigue. A number of patients with PD lose weight because of loss of fat. However, the evolution and determinants of weight loss are not well established. Possible determinants of weight loss in PD include loss of appetite, impaired hand-mouth coordination, difficulty in chewing and dysphagia, nausea, intestinal hypomotility, and increased energy requirements because of muscular rigidity and involuntary movements. Noticeable weight gain has repeatedly been reported after subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Because low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poor prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

      "title": "[Current and emerging features of obsessive-compulsive disorder--trends for the revision of DSM-5].",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized as significant impairment of cognitive-behavioral inhibition, which is causally associated with cognitive processes evoking anxiety, along with increased desire for perfect control over the possible harm, at least in typical OCD patients who have compulsions in response to obsessions. However, OCD has been well conceptualized as a multidimensional and heterogeneous disorder apparently comprising a number of potentially valid subtypes. For example, OCD can be diagnosed by either obsessions or compulsions, and a certain type of OCD patient has only compulsions in response to rules that must be applied rigidly. They often become stuck as a result of rigid rules in every step of their daily working and social life. This type of compulsive behavior is often triggered by specific sensory phenomena such as sight, touch, or personal expression (e. g. need to express himself precisely in written or spoken words). Thus, such OCD patients usually perform their compulsions in order to relieve sensory phenomena such as feelings of incompleteness and urges to reach a specific sensation of feeling \"just right\", and are less likely to have obsessions or cognitive processes preceding the repetitive behaviors. This type of OCD has also been characterized as \"tic-related\" and tends to have comorbid conditions such as tic disorders, ADHD or skin picking. Indeed, there are some crucial and significant differences in the psychopathology, phenomenology, and putative biological bases between OCD patients with obsession-related compulsions (cognitive type) and those with compulsions repeated according to rigid rules (motoric type). Because of the substantial heterogeneity of OCD, it seems to be beyond the traditional learning model in which anxiety-driven obsessions entrain neutralizing compulsions and also beyond the essential features of anxiety disorders commonly characterized by psychopathological characteristics such as marked and persistent fear, expectant anxiety, fear conditioning, avoidance, and cognitive process to evoke anxiety et al. Eventually, it has caused dramatic changes of view on the core psychopathology of OCD that is based on \"preoccupation\" and \"repeated behaviors\" as a failure of behavioral (cognitive and motor) inhibition, which also constitutes a key characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) in process of the revision of DSM-5. The precise nature and compass of this spectrum remains to be fully elucidated, but a preliminary approach emphasizes that putative OCRDs have phenomenological (e.g. repetitive thoughts or behaviors), etiological, psychobiological or treatment overlap with OCD, differentiating OCD from other anxiety disorders. Therefore, OCRDs, including OCD, may be classified apart from other anxiety disorders in the revisions of DSM-5 or ICD-11. Nevertheless, recent neuroimaging evidence points to the critical involvement of the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdalo cortical circuitry, in addition to cortico-striatal circuitry, in the pathophysiology of OCD, suggesting the possibility that fear extinction, in addition to behavioral inhibition, might be impaired in OCD similarly to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, studies have investigated the relevant neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, and neuroendocrinology commonly underlying depression, anxiety disorders and OCRDs, and have explored the underlying genetic basis of and relevant intermediate phenotypes for developing these conditions. Thus more research is needed to elucidate the essential relationships among these disorders and to validate the future diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome Complicating Mitochondrial Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare cause of upper intestinal obstruction. It results from a compression by the SMA of the third portion of the duodenum against the aorta (1). Precipitating factors include a prolonged supine position, severe lumbar lordosis, and a marked loss of weight with a subsequent loss of mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat (2). Mitochondrial encephalopathy encompasses a group of disorders characterized by morphologic, biochemical, or molecular evidence of abnormal mitochondrial function, with multiple organ involvements. They include several, usually distinct, clinical syndromes-e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh disease, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)(3,4). Some patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy have symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement. Episodic vomiting is one of the well-known symptoms in MELAS, Leigh disease, and MNGIE(3,5). No previous reports of SMA syndrome associated with severe weight loss related to mitochondrial encephalopathy have been published. We present the first such case and discuss the predisposition to this syndrome in children with metabolic diseases, characterized by recurrent vomiting and severe weight loss. CASE REPORT The patient, a 15-year-old boy, was referred to our hospital because of severe vomiting and weight loss. His early medical history was uneventful. He had been born at term and weighed 3,200 g. There were no perinatal abnormalities. Mental and physical development were normal in early childhood. However, at age 7, he began to have unilateral seizures with ocular deviation, for which he received anticonvulsant drugs. His development had been retarded since then. Computed tomographic scan of the brain, performed when he was 8 years old, revealed bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia. Abnormal Q waves were observed on the electrocardiogram, and there was dilated cardiomyopathy. Funduscopic examinations showed generalized pigmentary retinopathy without ophthalmoplegia. At the age of 8, the patient's blood concentration of lactate was 2.01 mmol/l (normal, 1.00-1.78 mmol/l), and the level of pyruvate was 0.102 mmol/l(normal, 0.034-0.068 mmol/l). The cerebrospinal fluid level of lactate was elevated to 4.74 mmol/l (upper limit, 2.22 mmol/l); that of pyruvate was 0.181 mmol/l (upper limit, 0.227 mmol/l). The lactate-pyruvate ratio was 19.7 in peripheral blood (upper limit, 20) and 26.9 in cerebrospinal fluid (upper limit, 25), respectively. An open muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the left rectus femoris. Modified Gomori's trichrome staining showed ragged red fibers with no other abnormalities. Enzyme activities of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase(complex V) were measured in accordance with previously reported methods(6). The enzyme activity of complex I of the patient's mitochondria was within normal range, whereas the enzyme activities of complexes II, III, IV, and V of the mitochondria were several times higher than normal values. These high levels of enzyme activities are attributable to the increased number of mitochondria in the tissue, appearing as ragged red fibers. Because all subunits of complex II are encoded by nuclear genes, whereas some of the subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and V are encoded by mitochondrial genes, it seems reasonable to compare the ratios of the activities of other complexes with those of the activity of complex II. Complex I activity, relative to complex II activity in the mitochondria, was markedly lower (19%) than that in normal control subjects(Table). Subunits of complex I, III, IV, and V were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies, according to the method of Tanaka et al(7). Results of immunoblot analysis of the subunits are shown in Figure 1. The amounts of subunits of complex III, IV, and V in the mitochondria markedly increased. However, the amounts of complex I subunits were almost normal. Similar disproportionate deficiency of respiratory enzymes has been reported in other patients with mitochondrial diseases (8-10). These laboratory values established the diagnosis of a relatively deficient complex I. Mitochondrial DNA analysis (11) was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS, MERRF, and Leigh disease. Results of the analysis were normal at the following nucleotide positions: nt 3243, nt 3252, and nt 3271 in tRNA for leucine in MELAS; nt 8344 and nt 8356 in tRNA for lysine in MERRF; nt 8993 in the gene for subunit 6 of ATPase in Leigh disease. Episodic attacks of vomiting occurred, with and without overexertion and stress, and the patient required fluid supplementation for dehydration. When he was 15 years old, he consulted a local physician for recurrent vomiting, weight loss, and symptoms of ileus. His condition deteriorated, and he was referred to our hospital for complete examination and treatment. On admission, he was 142.7 cm tall and weighed 27.4 kg, approximately 68% of his ideal weight for height. His skin was dry, with a decrease in turgor. There was severe abdominal distension with a decrease in bowel sounds. Neurologic examination showed bilateral pyramidal signs. An abdominal radiograph showed a double-bubble sign, with diminished gas shadows in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. An upper gastrointestinal series was performed, using barium introduced through a nasogastric tube. We observed an abrupt termination of the contrast-filled column in the horizontal portion of the duodenum, with dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum and antiperistaltic flow of the contrast medium (Fig. 2). These results led to a definitive diagnosis of SMA syndrome. The patient was treated conservatively. After the gastric contents were aspirated, a nasoduodenal tube was passed beyond the site of the obstruction into the paroximal jejunum, which led to a cessation of vomiting. Initial enteral feeding of 720 kcal/day by nasoduodenal tube, which was increased gradually to 1,500 kcal/day, resulted in significant improvement in his nutritional status. After 3 months, his weight increased from 27.4 to 35 kg, or 87% of his ideal body weight. All nutritional parameters were improved: serum transferrin was increased from 1,880 to 3,070 mg/l, prealbumin was increased from 132 to 287 mg/l, and retinol binding protein was increased from 22 to 57 mg/l. An upper gastrointestinal series performed 3 months later revealed no duodenal obstruction. Therefore, the patient was allowed oral intake of the enteral preparation. After 1 month of oral feeding, the duodenal tube was removed. The patient was able to eat a normal diet, and his weight gradually increased to 40 kg. At 12-month follow-up, he had not experienced a recurrence of SMA syndrome. DISCUSSION We have described SMA syndrome in a child with mitochondrial encephalopathy. Disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are heterogeneous in clinical phenotype and biochemical abnormalities. Biochemical and immunoblot analysis in this patient showed relative complex I deficiency. Complex I deficiency is known to be present in such conditions as MERRF, MELAS, MNGIE, and Leigh disease. Episodic vomiting is common in MELAS. However, our patient could not be classified clinically as having MELAS, because he had not had stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS. The common point mutations at nt 3243, nt 3255, and nt 3271 were not seen in his lymphocytes. Calcification of bilateral basal ganglia suggest a possibility of Leigh disease; however, ragged red fibers usually do not appear in Leigh disease. The point mutation reported in Leigh disease was not detected. Ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, and leukoencephalopathy are clinical characteristics of MNGIE. Our patient had no peripheral neuropathy or ophthalmoplegia. Improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, by short-term conservative enteral nutrition showed that episodic vomiting is not attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction in itself. What would cause SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy? The horizontal portion of the duodenum passes in front of the abdominal aorta and behind the superior mesenteric artery, at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (i.e., the SMA may compress the relatively immobile third portion of the duodenum to produce a “nutcracker” effect[12]). Precipitating factors of SMA syndrome include a prolonged supine position, visceroptosis, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, abnormally high fixation of the duodenal fixture of the ligament of Treitz, an unusually low origin of the SMA, loss of muscle tone in the duodenum, and a marked loss of weight with an associated loss of mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat (13). Severe weight loss and malnutrition, caused by repeated episodes of vomiting associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, were the apparent precipitating factors in our patient. Radiographs of the upper gastrointestinal tract with use of contrast medium is the standard method for diagnosing the SMA syndrome. Hines et al. cited the following roentgenographic criteria for this syndrome: dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum, abrupt vertical and oblique compression of the mucosal folds, antiperistaltic flow of barium proximal to the obstruction producing to-and-fro movements, a 4- to 6-hour delay in transit through the gastroduodenal region, and relief of obstruction when the patient is placed in a position that diminishes the drag of the small bowel mesentery(2). Our patient met most of these criteria. There is a danger of missing a diagnosis of duodenal obstruction in mitochondrial encephalopathy because this disorder is also characterized by episodic vomiting. Therefore, SMA syndrome should be considered when making the diagnosis of duodenal obstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy. The syndrome may thus be associated with such metabolic disorders as mitochondrial encephalopathy that are characterized by recurrent vomiting.Fig. 1: .

According to DSM-IV, NE is defined as repeated voiding, accidental or on purpose, into clothing or into the bed, at least twice a week, for 3 consecutive months, in children older than 5 years, age in which the sfincterial control is acquired. The pathophysiology of NE is not fully understood. It has been suggested that NE is the result of a combination of osmoregulatory or urodynamic disturbances, disorders of arousal and genetic factors. The evaluation of a child with minctional disorders begins with a good history and a physical examination. Then laboratory analysis and instrumental investigations can be used. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for NE. The role of drugs is a short-term possibility that allows the child to recover confidence, or a temporary measure to tide him/her over nights spent away from home. For too long, NE has not been recognised as a severe condition, because there was no specific education at medical school and a poor involvement by the practitioners.

      "title": "Marchiafava–Bignami Disease: A Rare Finding in Alcohol Dependence Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Marchiafava–Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare demyelinating disorder, associated with alcohol consumption over a prolonged period of time and malnutrition. Diagnosis is often missed due to symptoms mimicking other acute neurological conditions and approximately 250 cases have been reported worldwide.[1,2] This disease is characteristically diagnosed on neuroimaging, which is demonstrated as demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum.[3] We present the case of a 27-year-old male who presented with a history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol. He sustained injuries to the face and head, which was also associated with a brief loss of consciousness followed by agitation, altered sensorium, slurred speech, and gait abnormality. There was no history of posttraumatic seizure, vomiting, headache, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and hemotympanum. However, the patient was agitated, ataxic, and dysarthric with mild impairment in consciousness and the Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation was 10/15 (E3V3M4). Pupils were noticed to be of normal size and were normally reacting. There was no autonomic instability and neurological deficits on clinical examination. Noncontrast computed tomography head revealed an undisplaced fracture of the body of the mandible near the left angle of the mandible. There was no evidence of traumatic brain injury on the computed tomography (CT) scan. Laboratory results revealed a normal hematological profile, but the liver function tests revealed increased Serum Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (SGGT) 163 U/L, Serum Glutamic- Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT)-85 IU/L, Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT)-322 IU/L, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly with Grade-1 fatty liver. The patient demonstrated progressively increasing psychomotor action and worsening altered sensorium (mini-mental state examination [MMSE]-24/30 and Montreal cognitive assessment [MOCA]-19/30) with poor ideomotor recovery. A history revealed progressively increasing alcohol consumption over a period of 7-year fulfilling criteria of alcohol dependence syndrome as per the International Classification of Diseases-10. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed hyperintensity in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side suggestive of Type B MBD [Figure 1]. The patient was started on high doses of injectable thiamine hydrochloride 1.5 g/day in an intravenous infusion and injectable multivitamins along with oral anticraving drugs in the form of acamprosate (333 mg 2-2-2) in conjunction with forced abstinence. The patient responded satisfactory to treatment with improvement of sensorium and restoration of normal psychomotor activity. After stabilization, he was imparted with structured Yoga and Meditation (YogNidra and Pranayam) therapy by a trained yoga therapist. Cognitive retraining with cognitive restructuring App (Luminous) along with individual and group psychotherapy by a clinical psychologist in a deaddiction center aimed at relapse prevention. Over the next 3 months, the patient's cognitive functions improved (MMSE - 30/30 and MOCA - 29/30). MRI brain repeated after 12 weeks of the treatment revealed complete resolution of lesions [Figure 2].Figure 1: MRI brain of the patient at initial presentation prior to the start of the treatment. (a) Axial T2-weighted MR image, (b) coronal T2-weighted MR image, and (c) axial FLAIR MR image reveal hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side, (d) sagittal T1-weighted MR image shows hypodensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum in the central part sparing peripheral most part showing \"Sandwich sign.\" MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, MR: Magnetic resonance, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryFigure 2: MRI brain of the patient after 3 months of treatment. (a) Axial FLAIR image, (b) axial T1-weighted image, and (c) axial T2-weighted image show no abnormalities of the splenium. MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryConsidering the history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol with facial trauma associated with mild impairment in consciousness, dysarthria, ataxic gait, and cognitive impairment in a patient with evidence of chronic alcohol use and the classical \"Sandwich Sign\" on MRI, the important differentials which considered were traumatic brain injury, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and MBD. The history of trauma associated with mild impairment of consciousness and orientation pointed toward a structural abnormality such as an extradural/subdural hematoma or intracerebral hemorrhage and diffuse axonal injury, but these were ruled out by the initial CT scan and MRI brain. The background of chronic alcohol intake over the last 7 years and the presence of the classical \"Sandwich sign\" on MRI, however, tilted the scales in the favor of possible MBD. In case of chronic alcoholics, Wernicke's encephalopathy needs to be considered; it presents with milder symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and a speedy recovery as compared to MBD. It further can be distinguished on MRI by the symmetrical involvement of the thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, and periaqueductal gray matter.[4] An absence of relapsing-remitting symptoms and absent periventricular white matter lesions on MRI excluded the diagnosis of Multiple sclerosis.[5] Studies suggested that B1-hypovitaminosis is the pathophysiology of the disease. Hence, early replenishment of thiamine may improve outcomes in MBD patients. Studies have shown that early initiation of treatment within 14 days of onset of symptoms with high-dose thiamine and multivitamins has proven to be statistically beneficial as compared to delayed treatment.[4] Better outcomes noted in MBD patient with parenteral administration of thiamine compared to oral administration might be due to delayed intestinal absorption and deranged hepatic uptake associated with chronic alcoholism.[6] In conclusion, MBD, though a rare clinical entity, is potentially reversible with an early diagnosis and prompt initiation of high-dose thiamine and supportive care along with adequate rehabilitation as seen in our patient.

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "Obesity has become a major health problem and epidemic. However, much of the current debate has been fractious and etiologies of obesity have been attributed to eating behavior or fast food, personality issues, depression, addiction, or genetics. One of the interesting new hypotheses for epidemic obesity is food addiction, which is associated with both substance-related disorder and eating disorder. Accumulating evidences have shown that there are many shared neural and hormonal pathways as well as distinct differences that may help researchers find why certain individuals overeat and become obese. Functional neuroimaging studies have further revealed that good or great smelling, looking, tasting, and reinforcing food has characteristics similar to that of drugs of abuse. Many of the brain changes reported for hedonic eating and obesity are also seen in various forms of addictions. Most importantly, overeating and obesity may have an acquired drive like drug addiction with respect to motivation and incentive; craving, wanting, and liking occur after early and repeated exposures to stimuli. The acquired drive for great food and relative weakness of the satiety signal would cause an imbalance between the drive and hunger/reward centers in the brain and their regulation.",

      "title": "Electrogastrography for Evaluating Neurologically Impaired Children with Recurrent Vomiting",
      "abstract": "Author's Reply To the Editor: We very much appreciate Dr. Bustorff-Silva's observations. As Dr. Bustorff-Silva implies, the major issue regarding vomiting in neurologically impaired children is the pathogenesis of vomiting itself. It is clear that primary gastroesophageal reflux can be particularly severe in these children because of several concurrent and aggravating factors (e.g., scoliosis, prolonged supine positioning, poor swallowing) that have been recalled in our report. It also seems clear that a central nervous system disorder involving the brainstem nuclei of cranial nerves or areas next to the area postrema and the \"vomiting centers\" may result in a severe and widespread disturbance of gastrointestinal motility or a persistent activation of the emetic reflex, thereby causing what should more appropriately be defined as \"secondary\" gastroesophageal reflux. Because disturbances of gastric motility, such as gastric dysrhythmia and delayed gastric emptying may occur in both cases (i.e., widespread motility disorder and activation of the emetic reflex), a distinction between the two mechanisms is not easy to draw. The simple clinical observation may provide some clues-for instance, the presence of retching and other autonomic manifestations, such as sweating, pallor, and tachycardia, would support the\"reflex\" rather than the \"reflux\" mechanism (1). Whether we are facing a motility disorder involving the gastrointestinal tract well beyond the lower esophageal sphincter or a persistent activation of the emetic reflex (or both), it seems clear that the Nissen fundoplication may not solve the problem, and in fact it may even make it worse. Dr. Bustorff-Silva rightly suggests that preoperative and postoperative electrogastrography should help clarify the issue of which patients would benefit from fundoplication. Indeed, we recently showed some preliminary evidence that patients in whom gastric electrical activity is normal before fundoplication tend to do well, whereas those who have gastric dysrhythmias beforehand tend to experience retching and severe postprandial discomfort after the fundoplication (2). Electrogastrography may thus contribute to the clinical and pathophysiological information that should be gathered and carefully evaluated in neurologically impaired children with \"refractory\" gastroesophageal reflux, so that the pharmacologic, nutritional, or surgical therapeutic interventions can be more successfully tailored to the individual patient.

This paper examines the nature of their relationship by reviewing clinical descriptive, family-genetic, treatment, and biological studies that relate to the issue. The studies confirm the prominence of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders in eating disorders. Other psychiatric syndromes which occur with less frequency, such as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders in anorexia nervosa, or personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse in bulimia nervosa, also play an important role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders. Since few studies have controlled for starvation-induced physical, endocrine, or psychological changes which mimic the symptoms considered diagnostic for depression, further research will be needed. The evidence for a shared etiology is not compelling for anorexia nervosa and is at most suggestive for bulimia nervosa. Since in contemporary cases dieting-induced weight loss is the principal trigger, women with self-critical or depressive features will be disproportionately recruited into eating disorders. The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to severe depression, with somewhat higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a specific pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "Five cases of dependence on popular analgesics containing barbiturates as the active ingredient have been presented. In all of these cases the patient developed the habit of using the drugs in the second or third decade of life in order to accomplish relief from headache. A rapid increase in tolerance took place in a few months, with most of the patients eventually requiring several times the usual dose. Symptoms of chronic intoxication were often milder than those with other habituating drugs. No antisocial acts as a result of the abuse were observed. Headaches as a manifestation of chronic intoxication may be considered to have played a role in establishing analgesic dependence. The abstinence syndrome developed a few hours after withdrawal: a generalized convulsion occurred first, followed by various disturbances of consciousness and then by a hallucinatory-delusional state. These symptoms cleared up in three days to a week, while a corresponding course was followed by the EEG findings. Withdrawal symptoms didn't appear at the time when allopyrabital as the active ingredient of popular analgesic preparations was replaced with cyclopyrabital but did appear in four cases at the very time when bromvalerylurea was substituted as the active principle of these preparations. Even at that time such a syndrome was not manifested in one case, suggesting the possibility of a cross-reaction of allobarbital and cyclo-barbital and of barbiturate and bromvalerylurea.",

Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

The attacks were not kinesigenic and occurred during wakefulness precipitated by physical exercise and during NREM sleep, spontaneous or upon arousal and awakenings. Paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis was excluded by the absent family history, and paroxysmal kinesigenic dystonia by the absence of triggering effects by sudden movements and efficacy of anticonvulsants. Pattern and duration of involuntary movements were not those typical of nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia. Our cases emphasize that overlap exists among the different clinical categories of paroxysmal dyskinesia.",

Excess saliva accumulates in the mouth because of decreased swallowing frequency.

The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system.

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep disorders all involve a problem in the timing of when a person sleeps and is awake.The human body has a master circadian clock in a control center of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).This internal clock regulates the timing of such body rhythms as temperature and hormone levels.The primary circadian rhythm that this body clock controls is the sleep-wake cycle.The circadian clock functions in a cycle that lasts a little longer than 24 hours.The circadian clock is \"set\" primarily by visual cues of light and darkness that are communicated along a pathway from the eyes to the SCN.This keeps the clock synchronized to the 24-hour day.Other time cues, know as zeitgebers, also can influence the clock's timing.These cues include meal and exercise schedules.Circadian rhythms and their sensitivity to time cues may change as a person ages.Each circadian rhythm sleep disorder involves one of these two problems:• You have a hard time initiating sleep.• You struggle to maintain sleep, waking up frequently during the night.• You tend to wake up too early and are unable to go back to sleep.• You sleep is nonrestorative or of poor quality. Types of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders• Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSP): DSP occurs when a person regularly goes to sleep and wakes up more than two hours later than is considered normal.People with DSP tend to be \"evening types\" who typically stay awake until 1 a.m. or later and wake-up in the late morning or afternoon.If able to go to bed at the preferred late time on a regular basis, a person with DSP will have a very stable sleep pattern.DPS is more common among adolescents and young adults with a reported prevalence of 7-16%.It is estimated that DPS is seen in approximately 10% of patients with chronic insomnia in sleep clinics.A positive family history may be present in approximately 40% of individuals with DPS.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

The treatment therefore most likely to be successful in modifying the violent behaviour is that most appropriate for the underlying condition, and much may be achieved in calming aggressive behaviour without using any medication at all. No drug is a specific ‘treatment’ for violence. In situations of acute crisis, however, short‐term control of violent behaviour is often achieved most speedily and effectively when medication is included in the treatment approach. The drugs best fitted for such purposes have calming qualities. Neuroleptics are generally among the first to be used, followed by barbiturates or benzodiazepines. The power of the way in which such drugs are administered; for example, in the timing, route of delivery or form of preparation is often underestimated. In particular, the potential value of depot neuroleptics of intermediate duration of action is discussed. Longer‐term control of violence term of such drugs as the mood stabiliser lithium, anticonvulsants (including carbarnazepine), other sedatives and beta blockers is also discussed.",

Patients with BED usually exhibit higher than expected rates of eating related and general psychopathology. The interest about the usefulness of anti-obesity agents in BED regained a renewed interest with the introduction of sibutramine to the obesity armamentarium. The improvement in binge eating frequency was associated with a significant and important reduction in body weight as well as a concurrent decrease in depressive symptoms. One might expect that interventions specially designed for BN or obesity may have a therapeutic effect in binge eating syndromes. Combining pharmacological agents with psychological and/or nutritional interventions is a strategy frequently used in treating patients with eating disorders.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "title": "Attachment and mentalization in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa",
      "abstract": "Gehechtheid en mentaliseren bij anorexia nervosa en bulimia nervosa. De voornaamste conclusie van dit onderzoek is dat voor duurzaam herstel van anorexia nervosa (AN) en bulimia nervosa (BN) naast verandering van eetgedrag een beter begrip van zichzelf en een grotere autonomie in relatie tot anderen belangrijk zijn. AN en BN zijn aandoeningen die zich kenmerken door afwijkend eetgedrag en een onevenredig grote invloed van het gewicht op de zelfwaardering. Vrijwel altijd spelen er negatieve gevoelens over zichzelf en over het contact met anderen. Ook is er naast de eetstoornis vaak sprake van andere psychische problemen zoals depressiviteit, angst, persoonlijkheidsproblematiek, autisme of ADHD. Ondanks behandeling herstelt een aanzienlijk deel van de patienten niet. De vertaling van negatieve gevoelens in een obsessie met eten en gewicht, die zo kenmerkend is voor AN en BN, zou kunnen samenhangen met onveilige gehechtheid en een beperkt vermogen tot mentaliseren. Een onveilige gehechtheidsstijl kenmerkt zich door moeite om emotionele gebeurtenissen te hanteren. Goed mentaliseren houdt in dat je je een redelijk correcte voorstelling kunt maken van wat er in jezelf en anderen omgaat. Een beperkt mentaliserend vermogen zou mee kunnen spelen in de sociale moeilijkheden die patienten met AN en BN ervaren en hun neiging zich op uiterlijk en gewicht te richten. Bij patienten met een borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis bleken onveilige gehechtheid en beperkt mentaliserend vermogen door psychotherapie te kunnen verbeteren. Mijn onderzoek had als doel om meer zicht te krijgen op de rol van gehechtheid en mentaliseren in het beloop van AN en BN, en zo mogelijk bij te dragen aan verbetering van de behandeling. Daartoe werden 50 patienten gevolgd die in psychotherapeutische behandeling gingen in een specialistisch behandelcentrum voor eetstoornissen, tot 1 jaar en 1,5 jaar later. Eerst werden ze vergeleken met gezonde controlepersonen. Vragen betroffen: 1. verschillen tussen patienten en gezonde personen qua gehechtheid en mentaliseren, en de relatie van gehechtheid en mentaliseren met symptomen; 2. veranderingen qua gehechtheid en mentaliseren in 1 jaar van behandeling, en de samenhang van deze veranderingen met vermindering van symptomen. Naast de eetstoornis werd ook gekeken naar bijkomende psychische problematiek. Uitkomsten waren dat patienten vaker een onveilige gehechtheidsstijl hadden en minder goed konden mentaliseren dan de gezonde controlepersonen, zonder dat dit verband hield met de ernst van hun eetstoornis. Wel was er verband met het voorkomen van zelfverwondend gedrag en van een borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis. Een jaar later deden 38 patienten opnieuw mee aan het onderzoek. Eetstoornis, depressie, angst, persoonlijkheidsproblematiek en gehechtheid waren verbeterd; mentaliseren, autonomie en zelfverwonding niet. 28% was na 1 jaar geheel hersteld van de eetstoornis. Herstel – ook bij 1,5 jaar follow-up - hing samen met een groter mentaliserend vermogen. De herstelde patienten waren in 1 jaar tijd in vergelijking tot hen die niet waren hersteld autonomer geworden: minder gevoelig voor anderen en beter in staat met nieuwe situaties om te gaan. Conclusies uit mijn onderzoek zijn dat gehechtheid bij patienten met AN en BN door psychotherapie kan verbeteren, en dat de tijdsduur van 1 jaar misschien te kort was om ook het mentaliseren te zien verbeteren. De uitkomst dat herstel van AN en BN samenhing met beter mentaliseren en met toegenomen autonomie suggereert dat beide zaken van belang zijn om van gestoord eetgedrag en een obsessie voor gewicht af te kunnen komen, en derhalve in behandeling aandacht dienen te krijgen.",

      "abstract": "The long term development of periodic syndromes among children is little known. Our research has revealed that about one third of periodic headaches, two thirds of cyclic vomiting and half the cases of recurring abdominal pain disappear either before puberty or during adolescence. Other Authors have shown that this also happens in most cases of early-onset vertigo. The remaining headache cases develop into migraines in adults. When there is persistent cyclic vomiting, the collateral neurologic phenomena (headaches, vertigo, pallor, hypotonia, drowsiness) become more intense. This also happens in some cases of abdominal pain and paroxysmal vertigo which start in late childhood. Other sufferers from acute abdominal pain develop ulcers, gastroduodenitis and colitis as adults. Altogether, some infantile periodic syndromes (in particular the multi-symptomatic ones) have a common outcome, i.e. develop into more or less typical migraine syndromes. In these cases one can presume a common pathogenetic mechanism. In those cases where the outcome is favorable the pathogenesis may be different. These cases may often be spotted in early childhood on account of the monosymptomatic nature of the complaint or the absence of collateral neurologic symptoms as well as of the infrequency of critical episodes.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) Constipation affects 30–40% of patients with MS, whereas at least 50% of patients with MS have FI. These two conditions often coexist and can be more severe in advanced MS. They are major limiting factors on quality of life. Disrupted sensation and motor function of the anorectum ... There is very limited evidence for the following interventions: ... Spinal cord injury All patients will need active bowel management after spinal cord injury. If the patient cannot manage independently, they might need community services. Constipation results from slowed peristalsis (nerve damage and immobility). FI often results if the patient does not have a bowel routine (no sensory or motor function). Need to balance avoiding both constipation and FI. Injury above the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12) Upper motor neurone or reflex bowel. Bowel management may use diet, establishing a routine, often nocturnal laxatives and/or suppositories/micro-enema, and/or digital stimulation ( p. 644). May need manual evacuation to complete evacuation. The anus is normally closed and FI is unusual unless the reflex is stimulated. Beware autonomic dysreflexia in injuries to T6 and above ( p. 642).",

      "abstract": "The term “addiction” is usually used to describe a substance use disorder. Essentially, addiction is a primary, complex brain disorder that affects cognitive processes, neural func­tions, the brain’s reward mechanism, and other biological, so­cial and psychological aspects of the individual. Clas­si­­fy­ing food addiction as a substance use disorder ver­sus an eating disorder is difficult. To highlight the pre­va­lence of food addiction and the factors influencing it, a questionnaire with three main items was used. The results did not find a link between the frequency with which pa­la­table foods are consumed and the prevalence of food ad­dic­tion.

Depression is mostly resulted from an imbalance in brain chemical that can be due to more typically thought of as strictly biochemical-based or emotionally-rooted. As a result, nutrition can play a key role in the onset as well as severity and duration of depression. Several micronutrient deficiencies adversely affect the brain and hence could aggravate mental disorders. It is important that proper attention to diet, and, when indicated, appropriate supplementation with vitamin C, folic acid, niacin, thiamine, iron, zinc, magnesium , potassium and sodium and omega-3 fatty acids. As the brain chemical (neurotransmitters) are made from chemical precursors, usually from an amino acid (protein) and other micronutrients (vitamin and minerals), it is clear to understand how deficiencies of these nutrients could lead to changes in the pattern of brain chemical neurotransmitter production leading to mental illness like depression.",

When there is no secondary cause, constipation is diagnosed as functional constipation. The first steps that should be taken to relieve symptoms are diet and lifestyle modifications, and if unsuccessful, laxative therapy should be initiated. If a patient does not respond to laxative therapy, diagnostic anorectal physiological tests are performed, though they are not routinely recommended. However, these tests may be considered earlier in patients strongly suspected to have a defecatory disorder. The revised guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation will undoubtedly aid the individualized management of chronic constipation in clinical practice.",

These comorbid conditions have a high impact on patients quality of life, including eating attitudes and body image perception. Nutritional implications, together with sleepiness and sexual asthenia, are the principal side effects of the pharmacological therapy. Actually, drugs may compromise the nutritional status of patients producing appetite increase, dry mouth, constipation, glucose and lipid metabolism abnormalities, metabolic syndrome, mild transient dysphagia and nausea. About 40% of GTS patients experience hyperphagia because of drug side effects, OCBs, ADHD, or poor impulse control. Consequently, in these cases an overweight status can occur, complicating the management of the symptoms. Therefore, an increase body weight should be considered one of the most relevant factors increasing GTS drug-related bad compliance, which may consequently cause in some patients the discontinuation/interruption of the pharmacological therapy.",

      "title": "Problemas para dormir—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Los problemas para dormir son comunes en los niños con y sin trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre la mitad y un tercio de los niños con TEA tienen problemas para dormir. Esto puede causar problemas durante el día, como falta de atención, irritabilidad o exhibición de más comportamientos repetitivos. La cantidad de horas de sueño durante la noche que necesitan los niños en edad preescolar, en general, es de 10 a 13 horas. A medida que crecen, el tiempo se reduce. Para los 13 años, la cantidad habitual de sueño necesaria es de entre 8 y 11 horas. Los problemas para dormir pueden afectar también a los padres y cuidadores, además del niño, porque los padres pierden horas de sueño al estar atendiendo a un niño que está despierto.Los niños con TEA pueden tener muchos motivos para no dormir. Las causas pueden ser médicas, de comportamiento o ambas. Las causas médicas de los problemas para dormir pueden incluir alergias, problemas para respirar y reflujo gastroesofágico (molestias estomacales).Los medicamentos también pueden afectar el sueño. Los motivos de comportamiento que causan problemas para dormir pueden ser cambios en las rutinas diarias o de la hora de acostarse, estrés en casa o en la escuela, cambio de cuidadores o cualquier otra cosa que rompa el patrón habitual de su hijo.El sueño tiene ciclos con distintos patrones de ondas cerebrales. Estos patrones pueden ser distintos en algunas personas con TEA. Es posible que las personas con TEA tengan el sueño más liviano y sueñen menos más tarde en la noche. Ese es el momento en que frecuentemente ocurre el despertar durante la noche. La hormona llamada melatonina es producida por el cerebro para controlar el sueño. Algunos estudios científicos muestran que las personas con TEA posiblemente no tengan la misma cantidad o actividad de melatonina.Algunos problemas para dormir incluyen:El médico de su hijo puede realizarle un examen físico general y obtener los antecedentes de problemas de salud y para dormir. Trate de llevar un diario del sueño durante un tiempo para ayudar al médico del niño a comprender los hábitos de sueño de su hijo. Informe al médico del niño si su hijo ronca fuerte o si tiene problemas de respiración por la noche y cualquier otra afección de salud que pudiera tener su hijo. El pediatra del niño podría pedirle pruebas si la historia clínica o el resultado del examen físico sugirieran que hay motivos médicos que causan los problemas de sueño.Los estudios han demostrado que las estrategias de comportamiento ayudan más que los medicamentos a mejorar los problemas para dormir. Estos son algunos pasos que pueden ayudar:En ocasiones, el solo hecho de crear buenos hábitos de sueño ayuda con los problemas para dormir, pero tal vez se necesiten otras medidas.Muchos niños con TEA responden a las órdenes y a las recompensas al intentar cambiar sus comportamientos. Repase junto a su hijo lo que espera que haga, con anticipación y nuevamente cada noche. Piense en la posibilidad de usar una tabla de imágenes o una historia para describir la rutina de la hora de acostarse. Si su hijo se ha quedado en la cama, ofrézcale una recompensa por la mañana, como un dulce que le guste, un juego o un ratito para usar pantallas.Si los problemas para dormir continúan después de establecer un buen lugar para que su hija duerma y una rutina para dormir adecuadas, tal vez desee agregar el paso de ignorarla cuando lo llame desde su cama. Cuando deje a su hija en la habitación, diga “buenas noches” y felicítela por irse a la cama. Luego vaya a controlarla en los momentos en que usted haya decidido hacerlo (generalmente cada pocos minutos) e ignórela entre los controles. Extienda el tiempo entre los controles durante la noche y en el transcurso de los días siguientes. Cuando vaya a controlar, échele un vistazo a la habitación. Si su hija está despierta, dígale que se duerma y luego váyase. No hay problema si su hija se duerme en el piso.Es muy importante que todos los cuidadores respeten este paso; hable con el resto de su familia sobre este plan antes de implementarlo. Si vive en un apartamento o condominio, tal vez también quiera hablar con sus vecinos. Los llantos y berrinches de su hija empeorarán durante varios días, pero con el tiempo mejorarán. Es fundamental que respete su plan y lo lleve adelante de la misma manera durante al menos 2 semanas, de principio a fin, para poder notar una diferencia. Tal vez necesite ayuda adicional para hacer esto, ya que puede ser difícil y agotador para padres y cuidadores.Algunos niños con TEA necesitan atención permanente para mantenerlos a salvo debido a sus comportamientos. Si su hija corre riesgo de lastimarse cuando no la esté supervisando y suele despertarse mucho durante la noche, pruebe las siguientes medidas de seguridad:El pediatra de su hija puede sugerir el uso de medicamentos recetados o de venta libre junto con el entrenamiento del comportamiento. Debe hablar con el médico de su hija antes de probar cualquier medicamento o suplemento herbal para su hija.Si aplicó este consejo todos los días durante 2 semanas y su hija sigue teniendo problemas para dormir, debe hablar con el pediatra de la niña. Hay otras intervenciones del comportamiento que se pueden usar.Los problemas muy difíciles deberán ser consultados con un experto en el sueño.La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "abstract": "Anxiety pervades every aspect of human activity and experience. It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

      "abstract": "Secondary depression is common among primary alcoholics. However, its aetiology is poorly understood.Forty men with primary alcoholism, abstinent for two weeks or more, with a secondary major depressive episode were compared with forty matched never-depressed primary alcoholic controls for risk factors for depression and recent life events.In the six months before the onset of depression depressed alcoholics had experienced significantly more life events, more life events with negative impact, more dependent events caused by alcohol, and more independent events. Significantly more depressed alcoholics than controls had a family history of depression, a family history of suicidal behaviour and had themselves attempted suicide.Having recent life events, particularly events with negative impact, and a family history of depression are risk factors for secondary depression in alcoholics.",

In this situation, seizures provoked by eating is a rare entity and the ictal semiology differs from patient to patient. Focal impaired awareness seizure is most commonly described. Diffuse cerebral damage is often noted on MRI. Reproduction of these seizures during EEG recording is often difficult as the stimulus is frequently complex, involving different components of eating, such as the sight of food, proprioceptive, olfactive or gustative stimulations, chewing, salivation, and gastric distension of eating. The case presented here was an eating epilepsy case triggered by bread eating and implicated, based on EEG and MRI.",

      "title": "Recovery of central and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue after exercise",
      "abstract": "Sustained physical exercise leads to a reduced capacity to produce voluntary force that typically outlasts the exercise bout. This \"fatigue\" can be due both to impaired muscle function, termed \"peripheral fatigue,\" and a reduction in the capacity of the central nervous system to activate muscles, termed \"central fatigue.\" In this review we consider the factors that determine the recovery of voluntary force generating capacity after various types of exercise. After brief, high-intensity exercise there is typically a rapid restitution of force that is due to recovery of central fatigue (typically within 2 min) and aspects of peripheral fatigue associated with excitation-contraction coupling and reperfusion of muscles (typically within 3-5 min). Complete recovery of muscle function may be incomplete for some hours, however, due to prolonged impairment in intracellular Ca2+ release or sensitivity. After low-intensity exercise of long duration, voluntary force typically shows rapid, partial, recovery within the first few minutes, due largely to recovery of the central, neural component. However, the ability to voluntarily activate muscles may not recover completely within 30 min after exercise. Recovery of peripheral fatigue contributes comparatively little to the fast initial force restitution and is typically incomplete for at least 20-30 min. Work remains to identify what factors underlie the prolonged central fatigue that usually accompanies long-duration single joint and locomotor exercise and to document how the time course of neuromuscular recovery is affected by exercise intensity and duration in locomotor exercise. Such information could be useful to enhance rehabilitation and sports performance.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia. Conclusions : It can be concluded that patients with psychasthenia complain of sinking because of a reduction in psychological tension or an effort to recover the reduction in tension.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "title": "Assessment of the swallowing function through High-Density surface EMG",
      "abstract": "Swallowing is one of the most important human functions in our daily life consisting in a coordinated sequence of events aimed at moving nutrients from the mouth to the stomach. Despite its relevance, it has been less investigated than other motor activities. This is likely due to the complexity of this sensorimotor task. Indeed, a single swallow involves the coordination of more than 30 muscles within 1 second, including voluntary and reflexive activities: manipulation of food, displacements of the hyoid bone, hyolaringeal elevation and tilting of the epiglottis. All these events are possible because of the contraction of specific muscles of the submental region and in the anterior portion of the neck, controlled by swallowing center of the brainstem. Any structural or neurological impairment along the swallowing pathway is referred to as dysphagia, a pathology with high impact on the quality of life. An objective evaluation of the swallowing disorders is potentially relevant to identify and classify the type of dysfunction and to evaluate the outcome of treatments. Nevertheless, the evaluation of disorders of swallowing has to be preceded by a correct understanding of the normal physiology of swallowing. Currently, several technologies can be used in order to assess different aspects (e.g. mechanical or electrophysiological) of the swallowing function: videofluoroscopy (VFSS), endoscopy (FEES), manometry, electromyography. In this study we designed an integrated measurement framework for non-invasive assessment of the swallowing function of healthy and dysphagic subjects. Specifically, the proposed experimental setup includes high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) for a spatio-temporal evaluation of the electrical muscular activity and accelerometry for the temporal segmentation of swallowing phases based on hyolaringeal excursion. An experimental study was carried-out to: (i) assess the validity of this innovative setup by comparing the accelerometer-based task segmentation with that obtained with the clinical standard (FEES), (ii) study the spatiotemporal evolution of EMG activity to refine the indexes used to describe the activation of muscles involved in the swallowing (e.g. symmetry indexes). The study was conducted on a group of 10 healthy subjects performing 15 swallowing tasks with 5 types of bolus: saliva (dry swallow), 3 and 10 ml of water, 3 and 10 ml of gelled water. Results indicate: (i) a good intra-subject consistency between the accelerometer- and FEES-based identification of the swallowing onset. In fact, the accelerometer-based onset occurred, on average, 250 ms before that obtained with FEES, with an inter-subject variability of 300 ms (interquartile range), regardless to the type of bolus. Moreover, no significant differences were found in EMG symmetry indexes estimated considering the FEES-based and accelerometer-based segmentation. (ii) The sequence of muscle activation can be mapped with HD-sEMG that provides a spatiotemporal variation of EMG activity which is consistent among healthy subjects. In conclusion, the present study proposed a possible, alternative method for the evaluation of swallowing function with a non invasive, easy to use and innovative setup. The application of the proposed method on subjects with swallowing impairments is ongoing in order to assess its reliability for the assessment and the treatment of dysphagia itself.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

(2) Rarely, in the patient with cluster headache a separate kind of pain develops, even more intense but tic‐like, possible arising from compromise of the trigeminal ganglion by the subjacent “carotid process”. (3) The major enigmatic tempo, clustering of attacks of headache separated by prolonged remissions, may denote fluctuations in autonomic vasomotor function, secondary in some individuals to changing life stress and in others to endogenous biologic rhythms. A search is warranted for biochemical evidence for cycles in activating or suppressor mechanisms, through serial assays, as of serum, in patients accessible to long‐term study.",

There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

      "abstract": "Impulsivity refers to a tendency to act rapidly without full consideration of consequences. The trait is thought to result from the interaction between high arousal responses to potential rewards and poor self-control. Studies have suggested that impulsivity confers vulnerability to both addiction and obesity. However, results in this area are unclear, perhaps due to the high phenotypic complexity of addictions and obesity. Focusing on impulsivity, the aim of this review is to tackle the putative overlaps between addiction and obesity in four domains: 1) personality research, 2) neurocognitive tasks, 3) brain imaging and 4) clinical evidence. We suggest that three impulsivity-related domains are particularly relevant for our understanding of similarities between addiction and obesity: lower self-control (high Disinhibition/low Conscientiousness), reward sensitivity (high Extraversion/Positive Emotionality) and negative affect (high Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality). Neurocognitive studies have shown that obesity and addiction are both associated with increased impulsive decision-making and attention bias in response to drug or food cues, respectively. Mirroring this, obesity and different forms of addiction seem to exhibit similar alterations in fMRI brain activity in response to reward processing and during self-control tasks. Overall, our review provides an integrative approach to understand those facets of obesity that present similarities to addictive behaviors. Additionally, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting inhibitory control may represent a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue in operational settings has many facets, as is discussed in various other contributions. A number of mathematical models has been developed to predict fatigue and performance under conditions of sleep loss and/or circadian misalignment. The net level of fatigue resulting from these two processes is modulated by a variety of other factors, which are subsumed under the broad categories of internal states and external states. Performance instability in particular makes fatigue problematic in operational settings, as it leads to human error at unpredictable moments in time. The normative way to control work times in order to manage fatigue involves promulgation of hours of service regulations, which typically prescribe maximum durations of duty time and minimum durations of rest. However, because hours of service regulations disregard sleep/wake history and circadian rhythmicity, they may at times be overly restrictive and inflexible, and at other times overly permissive and unsafe.",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

The former tend to be characterologically disturbed and socially disadvantaged.

The history, pattern of nausea and vomiting, associated symptoms, and physical examination provides clues as to etiology and may guide therapy. Continuous severe nausea unrelieved by vomiting is usually caused by medications or metabolic abnormalities, while nausea relieved by vomiting or induced by eating is usually due to gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, or small bowel obstruction. Drug choices are empiric or based on etiology. Metoclopramide has the greatest evidence for efficacy followed by phenothiazines and tropisetron. Corticosteroids have not been effective in randomized trials except in the case of bowel obstruction. Treatment of nausea unresponsive to first-line medications involves rotation to medications which bind to multiple receptors (broad-spectrum antiemetics), the addition of another antiemetic to a narrow-spectrum antiemetic (a serotonin receptor antagonist such as tropisetron to a phenothiazine), rotation to a different class of antiemetic (tropisetron for a phenothiazine), or in-class drug rotation. Venting gastrostomy, octreotide, and corticosteroids will reduce nausea and vomiting associated with malignant bowel obstruction.",

Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "Polypharmacy is the consequence of multimorbidity. Both phenomena may cause functional limitations and/or frailty and/or care dependency in older people. In the human body, a medicament undergoes at least 3 important actions: absorption, distribution and elimination. These actions may proceed aberrantly in older people. Following interaction with receptors, a medicament triggers a chain reaction in the human body. The receptors and each link of the chain reaction may be subject to changes due to diseases as well as ageing. This, particularly, is the case with regard to medications directed towards the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, interactions may occur between various medications mutually and between medications on the one hand and on the other hand food and water intake, self-medication with herbs, and diseases. Moreover, older people usually experience more adverse effects of medications when compared to younger people. This is due to altered body actions and reactions, polypharmacy and the many possible interactions. In older people, utilisation and intake of medications often give rise to problems that can be divided into medicament-related, patient-related, care- and care provider-related and other problems.Polyfarmacie is het gevolg van multimorbiditeit. Beide kunnen leiden tot kwetsbaarheid, functiebeperking en/of zorgafhankelijkheid bij ouderen. Een medicament ondergaat in het lichaam minimaal 3 belangrijke processen: absorptie, distributie en eliminatie. Bij ouderen kunnen deze processen afwijkend verlopen. Een medicament zet in het lichaam een kettingreactie in gang na interactie met receptoren. De receptoren en elk onderdeel van de kettingreactie kunnen door ziekten en veroudering veranderingen ondergaan. Dit speelt vooral bij medicamenten die werken op het centrale zenuwstelsel en het cardiovasculaire systeem. Daarnaast kunnen interacties optreden tussen verschillende medicamenten onderling en tussen enerzijds medicamenten en anderzijds voedsel- en waterinname, zelfmedicatie met kruiden en ziekten. Voorts ervaren ouderen doorgaans meer bijwerkingen van medicamenten dan jongeren. Dit komt door de gewijzigde lichaamsacties en -reacties, de polyfarmacie en de vele mogelijke interacties. Gebruik en inname van medicamenten leidt bij ouderen vaak tot problemen die te verdelen zijn in medicamentgerelateerde, patiëntgerelateerde, zorg(verlener)gerelateerde en overige problemen.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a complex syndrome with unique cognitive, psychomotor, and mood features. Mannerisms and stereotypies are catatonic signs that have been extensively observed and described in the literature, mostly in the context of movements or motor acts. Stereotypies are commonly described as repetitive psychomotor or verbal acts with the abnormality not inherent in the act but in its frequency. Mannerisms, like stereotypies, are repetitive psychomotor or verbal acts, but they are fundamentally odd in nature. Recently, several reports have described these phenomena in the context of complex behaviors, such as eating and drinking. Identification and appreciation of personal and cultural norms, in addition to a careful analysis of behavioral processes and actions, are important tools for clinicians to identify these potentially elusive and often missed patterns of behavior in patients with catatonia. We present the case of a 30-year-old male with a psychiatric history of treatment-resistant, recurrent major depressive disorder with psychotic features who presented to the inpatient psychiatric unit with signs of catatonia, including repeated, purposeless eating. The patient’s chart was reviewed, and a literature review was conducted using PubMed with the keywords catatonia , stereotypies , mannerisms , and hyperphagia . The patient, who was diagnosed with catatonia and expressed hyperphagia as a stereotypy, responded to lorazepam. This case shows that hyperphagia may present as a stereotypy in patients with catatonia.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "abstract": "In order to suggest therapy modifications with the aim of diminishing the risk of therapy-induced long-term distressful symptoms in cancer survivors, data are needed relating details of therapy to the long-term symptom situation. In this article, the concepts and means used to assess the latter while developing the Radiumhemmet scale for symptom assessment are described. The focus is on the subjective long-term situation, and symptoms as a perceived abnormality are defined. For conceptual clarity, one symptom at a time is considered, excluding scales in which items are summarized. Moreover, measures of disease occurrence in the population are translated (epidemiologically) into measures of symptom occurrence in an individual. Nature distinguishes one long-term symptom from another. Occurrence of a symptom in an individual is measured by an incidence (e.g. number of defecations per week) or prevalence rate (e.g. urinations with involuntary cessation divided by the total number of urinations). Any scale expressing symptom intensity is arbitrary, be it 'verbal' (no/little/moderate/much pain) or visual (analogue or with integers). A time period describes symptom duration. The relevance of a symptom to emotions and social activities, sometimes cited as the associated symptom-induced distress, is a separate issue from symptom occurrence, intensity, and duration.",

      "title": "How Long to Wait for an Antidepressant to 'Work'",
      "abstract": "Prevailing wisdom says it takes 3 to 4 weeks for an antidepressant to show effect. Historically, patients who improve in the first 2 weeks have been labeled (1) Several recent studies, however, demonstrate a real, drug-based in many patients as early as the first week of treatment, depending on the medication (Table). (2-5) In practical terms, these studies raise the question of how long you should wait for an antidepressant to work. Early indications. Here are some tips for gauging antidepressant response, depending on what you see in the first 2 to 4 weeks: * Obtain a pretreatment score on the Beck Depression Inventory or other depression rating scale, and repeat the assessment at least once between days 7 and 10 of treatment. If there is little or no improvement, consider a modest dosage increase. * Don't assume that a patient who responds to an antidepressant during the first 2 weeks is experiencing a placebo effect. It may be a drug-mediated response. Some patients will retain and build on this early response, whereas others' may wane over subsequent weeks. * No to an antidepressant during weeks 1 through 4 does not bode well for most patients, (5,6) although the data do not support giving up on an antidepressant after 1 to 2 weeks of nonresponse. Responses will accumulate during weeks 3 to 5 of treatment. (7) * Patients who show little during the first 2 weeks of treatment but experience some improvement during weeks 3 and 4 may be late responders. However, if the patient shows no improvement by week 3 or 4, consider switching to a different antidepressant, perhaps one from a different chemical class. (8) * Different neurovegetative signs and symptoms of depression may improve at different rates, with some requiring >8 weeks of treatment. Insight, for example, may not improve until the second month of treatment. (9) * Individualize treatment. Many treatment-refractory depressed patients--who failed to respond to 1 or more adequate drug trials--may require longer and more intensive treatment (>3 months) before showing a robust response. (10) * Onset of response does not equal clinical recovery, nor is an improved Hamilton Depression Scale score a proxy for high quality of life. Patients may need [greater than or equal to]2 months for clinically significant improvement in interpersonal, social, and vocational function. (11) References 1.

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS THROUGH AYURVEDA: A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "Non-pharmacological management refers to the management without the use of medications. Gastrointestinal disorders, especially Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs), are common disorders characterized by persistent and recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms due to abnormal functioning of the enteric nervous system where no structural or organic pathology is identified. FGIDs are associated with motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function, gut microbiota, etc. To fully understand the pathophysiology of FGIDs, it is important to comprehend the biopsychosocial behaviour, which focuses on understanding and treatment of the illness and the subjective sense of the patient's suffering. Globally, the most common FGIDs (irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) alone affect 16–26% of the population. The non-pharmacological management includes reassurance, lifestyle modifications including observance of dinacharya (daily regimen), gut hygiene, ritucharya (seasonal regimen), psychotherapy, dietary interventions like intake of pathyaahara, implementing sadvritta, the ideal code of conduct, performing yoga, etc. Since gastrointestinal disorders are highly prevalent and pharmacological modalities are limited in contemporary medicine. Thus, a non-pharmacological approach can be preferred in today’s era for sustainable results. Ayurveda follows a holistic approach and has never considered an individual's physical, physiological, and psychological aspects as separate entities. Hence, the management of different diseases has been given under three modalities: daivavyapashraya, yuktivyapashraya, and satvavajaya chikitsa. Thus, in the non-pharmacological management of FGIDs, Ayurveda played a magnificent role.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and functional constipation in the adult",
      "abstract": "In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an \"all or nothing\" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods, fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants, psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation, surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of them.",

Recognizing depression is difficult because patients present predominantly with somatic symptoms or because attention is primarily focused on the co-morbid physical disorder. The cases of depression presenting in primary-care settings are either not identified or treated with inappropriate drugs or inadequate doses of anti-depressants. To analyze current level of intervention done by non-psychiatrists to detect and manage depression in patients with chronic medical illnesses. A panel of nine specialists (Cardiologists, Neurologists, Endocrinologists and Psychiatrists) discussed current Indian scenario of management of co-morbid depression by non-psychiatrists. The panel agreed that • Prevalence of co-morbid depression in India is not well-documented except for few regional studies. • It is frequently witnessed but is hardly recognized or managed as a concurrent disease. • There is a need to differentiate between depressive 'feeling\" and 'disease\". • The clinicians should increase duration of history-taking to include questions like, 'Do you feel sad/low? Are you disinterested?\" in suspected cases. • There is a need for developing Indian consensus to identify co-morbid depression, to decide when to start an antidepressant drug, in what dosage and duration with special focus on the when to refer to a psychiatrist. Concrete steps are required towards large-scale data generation and development of Indian consensus on the management of co-morbid depression in patients with chronic medical illnesses for the non-psychiatrists to improvise patient health outcome.",

Stress has also been related to various metabolic and psychological aberrations in an individual. Obesity is currently one of the most prevalent health concerns globally which is directly associated with stress too. Study by Costarelli et al. (2009) have shown that overweight preoccupation is a significant factor in predicting disordered eating, which is in accordance with many other studies. Previous studies suggest that there's a number of Eating disorders which have been associated with chronic stress. A person can know a lot about nutrition, know what foods are not healthy, but can still make poor decisions when unable to recognize, reason, and solve problems based on emotional patterns,. For example, compulsive eaters may understand nutrition, but they may not realize their emotions affect their food choices. Therapy is often successful in teaching individuals with ED's to recognize the feelings that trigger the behaviour associated with their diagnosis. The current article aims at developing EI as a management tool for preventing the occurrence or managing existing eating disorders leading to obsessive dietetic limitations in an individual.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Headache is the most prominent side effect of nitrate therapy. Lack of compliance is usually associated with headache which has a detrimental effect on quality of life. In spite of the high frequency of this adverse effect, the headache characteristics, timing and risk factors are less known. On the other hand, intravenously administered nitroglycerin-induced migraine attack is a common human research model in migraine. AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY: to evaluate the headaches occurring after administration of therapeutic dose of sublingual nitroglycerin, in migraineurs and controls.Twenty-eight female migraine patients without aura and 14 healthy controls received 0.5 mg nitroglycerin. Headache intensity and characteristics have been investigated for 24 hours.two types of headache developed after the nitroglycerin administration: (1) an immediate headache that does not fulfil the criteria for migraine, mild and disappears spontaneously within 1 hour; (2) a typical migraine attack without aura develops several hours after the nitroglycerin administration (mean latency: 250 min), moderate or severe, and warrants antimigraine therapy. The two types of headache developed independently. The nitroglycerin-induced headaches have not been determined solely by the previous migraine diagnosis, although both immediate (p = 0.0045) and typical migraine headache (p = 0.00047) were significantly more frequent among migraineurs compared to controls. Moreover, those control subjects who experienced migraine attacks had predispositions to migraine. Previous results of the authors supported that lower platelet serotonin concentration and higher plasma CGRP concentration, during the headache free period, are risk factors that express greater susceptibility to develop both spontaneous and nitroglycerin-induced migraine attack.Authors suggest an accurate exploration of the headache case-history before nitroglycerin treatment. This makes it possible to give proper information to migraine patients and possible migraine patients, and thus suitable treatment can be offered if needed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

During episodes of somnambulism, appetitive behaviors are unusual and, when they do, occur, raise questions as to the true state of consciousness of the patient. This is the first report of somnambulistic sleepeating in which polysomnographic studies were performed to document the sleep-related nature of the nocturnal eating. During all-night sleep studies, three patients complaining of eating during sleep had episodic behavior in non-REM sleep, consistent with a somnambulistic etiology. In all three patients, a conscious preoccupation with food was present and two patients showed a high percentage of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest a concurrence of organogenic and psychogenic factors, that has been postulated previously to underlie somnambulism in adults.",

      "abstract": "PD is common neurodegenerative disease that has been traditionally thought to affect predominantly the motor system and result from substantia nigral dopamine cell loss. More recently, a broader view of PD has emerged, incorporating non-dopaminergic symptoms and wide spread pathology. Among the most common of these non-motor features is gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, which was noted by James Parkinson in 1817 in his original monograph. [1] Constipation is reported much more commonly in PD than controls. [2-4] In fact, constipation predicts the onset of PD motor features and is thus thought to occur in PD long before meaningful substantia nigral dopamine cell loss. [5] Decreased bowel movement frequency in PD probably results from prolonged colon transit time. [6-8] Gastric emptying time and small intestine transit time is also prolonged in PD, but in normal physiology passage of food through the esophagus, stomach and small intestine takes 4-6 hours, whereas colon passage takes about 24 hours. [9] PD patients also have difficulties with the volitional defecation process. This is most commonly caused by dyssynergy between sphincter / puborectalis muscles, which normally relax during defecation, and contraction of the muscles that increase intraabdominal pressure to propel the stool from the sigmoid colon to the rectum. [8, 10, 11] PD patients demonstrate marked neuropathology throughout the GI system. The majority of parasympathetic innervation that normally increases GI motility derives from the dorsal motor nucleus, a region of the brain heavily damaged early in PD. [12, 13] The peripheral enteric nervous system, including the Myenteric plexus, also show marked abnormalities in PD, including Lewy body deposition, alpha-synuclein deposition, and dopaminergic neuronal loss. [14-18] In fact it is now speculated that this may represent the initial pathology in PD. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that enhances a chloride-rich intestinal fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum that is approved for the treatment of chronic constipation. [19] Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating the chloride channel-type 2 (ClC-2), which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A-independent fashion. Systemic absorption of the drug is negligeble. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. [20] Lubiprostone has not been formally studied in constipation associated with PD. RESULTS",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children.

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

      "title": "Chronic stress in sheep: assessment tools and their use in different management conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic stress occurs when animals are unable to deal with a persistent stressor with species-typical responses, or when several stressors are present concurrently. Chronic stress is most frequently considered in intensive systems, but it may also be a welfare concern for extensively managed species, such as the sheep. Here we review behavioural and physiological responses of sheep to experimentally induced chronic stressors to determine relevant indicators of chronic stress. Neuroendocrine responses to chronic stress are difficult to interpret because initial responses are followed by an apparent normalisation. Thus, cortisol or catecholamines may be at or below pre-stress levels during chronic stress, but this varies with different stressors. Chronic stress can also affect reproductive function, impair body and wool growth and meat quality, reduce immune function, and is associated with greater parasite burdens in sheep. Chronic stress induces alterations in behaviour patterns, particularly activity and feeding, and circadian rhythms of behaviour. Stereotypic behaviours, however, are infrequent in sheep and may occur only in experimental conditions of social isolation. Behavioural and physiological data suggest that rough handling and sheepdogs may be sources of chronic stress for sheep. Social subordination and weaning also act as chronic stressors, leading to higher parasitism in these animals and a greater response to additional stressors. Lameness and parasitism are associated with physiological and behavioural responses indicating that these are severe forms of chronic stress in sheep. It is unclear whether environmental stressors, such as weather and food availability, induce chronic stress in sheep. Under-nutrition may, however, be a welfare concern through its impact on lamb survival. The existence of many sources of chronic stress in the management of sheep suggests that the welfare of this species requires more attention than it has currently received.",

Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient.

Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.",

      "title": "Summary Australian and New Zealand Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Anorexia Nervosa(2003)",
      "abstract": "Objective: To provide a summary of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Conclusions: Anorexia nervosa affects only a small proportion of the Australian and New Zealand population but it is important because it is a serious and potentially life-threatening illness. Sufferers often struggle with AN for many years, if not for life, and the damage done to their minds and bodies may be irreversible. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a deliberate loss of weight and refusal to eat. Overactivity is common. Approximately 50% of patients also use unhealthy purging and vomiting behaviours to lose weight. There are two main areas of physical interest: the undernutrition and mal-nutrition of the illness and the various detrimental weight-losing behaviours themselves. Basic psychopathology ranges from an over-valued idea of high salience concerning body shape through to total preoccupation and eventually to firmly held ideas that resemble delusions. Comorbid features are frequent, especially depression and obsessionality. It is inadvisable in clinical practice to apply too strict a definition of AN because to do so excludes patients in the early stage of the illness in whom prompt intervention is most likely to be effective. The best treatment appears to be multidimensional/multidisciplinary care, using a range of settings as required. Obviously, the medical manifestations of the illness need to be addressed and any physical harm halted and reversed. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of further treatments. There is a paucity of clinical trials, and their quality is poor. Furthermore, the stimuli for developing AN are varied, and the psychotherapy options to address these problems need to be tailored to suit the individual patient. Because there is no known ‘chemical imbalance’ that causes the illness, no one drug offers relief. There is a high rate of relapse, and some patients are unable to recover fully. Because AN is a psychiatric illness, a psychiatrist should always be involved in its treatment. All psychiatrists should be capable of assuming this responsibility. Because cognitive behavioural methods are generally accepted as the best mode of therapy, a clinical psychologist should also be involved in treatment. Because medical manifestations are important, someone competent in general medicine should always be consulted. The optimal approach is multidisciplinary or at least multiskilled, with important contributions from psychologists, general practitioners, psychiatric nurses, paediatricians, dietitians and social workers.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia--waking up during the night due to the urge to urinate and empty the bladder--is a serious problem for affected patients. In the past decades, nocturia has been primarily regarded as an irritative symptom of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). This symptom is however frequently not influenced by different BPH treatments. In the last couple of years one has come to the conclusion that the prostate is less involved and in part responsible for the symptoms since women are also frequently affected. For these reasons nocturia is looked at differently. It is a highly prevalent symptom which neither qualitatively nor quantitative differs between men and women. Many factors lead to nocturia. The following diseases are involved: coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus or insipidus, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), states of anxiety or insomnia as well as behavioural and environmental factors. Nocturia can be categorised in nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of nightly urine) or a diminished bladder capacity or a combination of both. These entities can be easily differentiated by arithmetic analysis, e.g., a 48-hour voiding diary. Only recently nocturia has been classified according to the aetiology and pathogenesis, making a differentiated treatment possible. However, even in the cases in which the underlying cause cannot be found behavioural changes can help. Nevertheless, pharmacological treatments are inevitable. Medical treatments include: desmopressin, anticholinergics and antimuscarinics, general-medical measures like support stockings, different time for the intake of diuretics or in specific cases the nasal CPAP artificial respiration (continuous positive airway pressure). In spite of the partly high effectiveness of these measures, treatment should be customised taking possible side effects in account.",

An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

Our own experience of 48 cases of seizures suspected to have been caused by benzodiazepine withdrawal and reported to the Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring Center (1979-1985) showed that a great variety of benzodiazepines with different half-lives were involved, those most frequently implicated being the most widely prescribed. The occurrence of seizures was not always related to the interruption of long-term treatment (from a few days to greater than 7 years) nor to high-dose treatment, the range of dosages being usually close to that recommended. However, in some cases, several benzodiazepines had been taken simultaneously. The time between the last intake of the drug(s) and the occurrence of the seizures was shorter when a short-life benzodiazepine had been used. Additional factors were frequently involved; these factors were present in 29 cases and were multiple in nine of them. The incidence of withdrawal seizures was related more to the presence of these additional factors than to either the pharmacokinetics of the drugs or the pattern of treatment.",

      "title": "Symptomkontrolle am Lebensende",
      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

Pharmacodynamic aggravation of epilepsy usually translates into both increased seizure frequency and increased interictal electroencephalographic changes. A doubling or greater in seizure frequency may be considered as evidence for seizure aggravation. Seizure aggravation can occur with virtually all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Somerville, 2002; Gayatri and Livingston, 2006). As the underlying mechanisms for antiseizure effects of AEDs are not fully understood, the mechanisms involved in seizure aggravation cannot be explained with certainty.",

      "title": "The Effect of Balance and Coordination Exercises on Quality of Life in Older Adults: A Mini-Review",
      "abstract": "The ability to control balance during activities of daily living (ADL) is impaired in older adults, as a result of deterioration in the sensory systems (i.e., vestibular, visual, somatosensory), the cognitive system (central nervous system), and the musculoskeletal system. Consequently, many older adults face a risk of falling during their ADL. In most cases, falls and related injuries impair the quality of life and result in physical limitations, anxiety, loss of confidence, and fear of falling. Among a variety of fall prevention interventions, adapted physical activity programs have been suggested for improving balance control during ADL. These programs challenge the sensory, cognitive, and musculoskeletal systems, while addressing balance constraints such as orientation in space, changes in direction, and the speed or height of the center of mass during static and dynamic situations resembling ADL. The above-mentioned elements can be dealt with through a combination of balance and coordination exercises that challenge the postural control systems in multiple dimensions – including vertical and horizontal changes of the center of mass, standing on unstable surfaces with a reduced base of support, and changing body directions. Consequently, such exercises require environmental information-processing. The combination of dual-task, function-oriented challenges while controlling balance stimulates the sensory and neuromuscular control mechanisms. Among older adults, these programs have been found to improve static and dynamic stability, as well as a number of aspects in the quality of life. Recently, they have also been found to improve cognitive functions such as memory and spatial cognition.",

Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

      "abstract": "This study describes the clinical features, natural history and treatment of 100 patients with narcolepsy. Over half had one or more affected relatives. Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "Dhatukshaya, or the depletion of bodily tissues, is a fundamental concept in ayurveda that highlights the progressive degeneration of the seven dhatus. Prameha progresses through stages linked to the tridosha: kapha in early stages, pitta in intermediate stages, and vata in advanced stages, exacerbating degeneration due to dhatu shitilata (tissue laxity) and obstruction in the srotas. The pathogenesis of prameha involves derangement of doshas, subsequent impairment of dhatwagni, and metabolic disturbances in the dhatus, which in turn disrupt normal carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. These further damages the tissues and impacts the mutravaha srotas (urinary system). Prameha progressively affects multiple dhatus (tissues) including rasa, meda, and majja, leading to symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, dryness, and neuropathy. Tissue depletion disrupts nourishment, fluid balance, and energy reserves, resulting in systemic complications over time. Diabetes Mellitus has become a major global health concern, causing extensive numerous cellular damages in different organs at various stages of the disease. Diabetes contributes or accelerates the process of degeneration by chronic hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), inflammation and immune dysregulation.",

Professionals who treat patients with an eating disorder need to have knowledge of the nutritional effects and physiological consequences of the illness. This is rare within a predominantly mental health setting. The extreme dieting behaviour in anorexia nervosa leading to the severe weight loss and symptoms of semi‐starvation; binge‐eating behaviour, seen in cases in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder; and the patient’s distorted beliefs about nutrition and dietary requirements all underpin the need for the expertise provided by dietitians. They now have an essential role within the multi‐disciplinary assessment and treatment programmes for all three major eating disorders.",

      "title": "Evaluación del efecto antidepresivo del secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas precondicionadas en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor",
      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

Dalam istilah medis enuresis adalah istilah untuk anak yang mengompol minimal dua kali dalam seminggu dalam periode paling sedikit 3 bulan pada anak usia 5 tahun atau lebih, yang tidak disebabkan oleh efek obat-obatan. Dari beberapa penelitian didapatkan kondisi enuresis terjadi pada usia 5 tahun, pada usia tersebut didapatkan angka enuresis sekitar 10-15% dimana anak masih mengompol paling tidak satu kali dalam seminggu. Kondisi enuresis pada anak tersebut dapat dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor diantaranya peningkatan volume urin, ketidakmampuan untuk bangun dan menahan berkemih saat kandung kemih penuh. Kondisi Enuresis dapat memberikan dampak terhadap perkembangan anak secara fisik maupun psikis, diantaranya akibat dari enuresis ini anak akan mengalami gangguan perilaku baik dari sisi internal ataupun eksternal. Adapun penanganan kondisi enuresis didasarkan pada 4 prinsip diantaranya adalah peningkatan motivasi dari anak, pengaturan perilaku dari anak, penggunaan enuresis alarm, dan farmakoterapi jika semua kondisi non farmakoterapi sudah dilakukan.

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "abstract": "We report the case of an adult psychiatric patient who developed new-onset focal bilateral motor seizures (FBMS) in the context of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. The patient was forced to interrupt chronic lormetazepam abuse and overdosed on amitriptyline (800 mg in an oral solution) before the onset of seizures. Typical signs of amitriptyline intoxication such as sedation and anticholinergic effects were not observed. Video-EEG recordings revealed a stereotypical ictal motor pattern with asymmetric tonic posturing and bilateral clonic movements of the upper limbs, but there were no abnormalities identified by EEG. Seizures recurred multiple times per day but resolved simultaneously when withdrawal symptomatology subsided eight days after onset. Nonepileptic seizures (NES) were considered in the differential diagnosis because of the patient's psychiatric history including preserved awareness during the bilateral convulsions, the absence of postictal confusion, and normal EEG. The present case indicates that FBMS may occur during benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients who overdosed on amitriptyline. The diagnosis may be challenging as FBMS may mimic NES in the absence of abnormal neurophysiologic findings. This may be especially challenging in patients with an underlying psychiatric disease.",

      "abstract": "Mania is one of the few emergent conditions in psychiatry. Vigorous treatment, aimed at achieving symptom control as promptly as possible while avoiding adverse effects, is therefore important. Strategies to accomplish this aim are possible, but differ for each of the three antimanic drugs principally employed. For lithium, uncomplicated manic patients can be started at 15 mg/kg of body weight, with dosage increase every 3 to 4 days until response, complicating adverse effects, or a serum level of 1.2 to 1.4 mEq/L occurs. Valproate, if administered as divalproex, can usually be initiated at a dosage of 20 mg/kg of body weight, which is associated with earlier improvement than that observed with lithium. Carbamazepine requires a relatively slow dosage escalation from an initial 200 mg once or twice daily, due to the possibility of neuromuscular and cognitive adverse effects. Adjunctive medications are frequently necessary and add to the importance of a thorough knowledge of the dosing strategies needed at different points in early therapy of bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders--anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) occur usually in young females. The significant pathogenic differences between patients who only restrict food, and patients with binge eating and compensatory behaviours, such as vomiting and purging were described. The prevalence of bipolar affective disorders--especially bipolar II and bipolar spectrum disorders (BS) may reach 5% in the general population. About half of the depressive episodes are associated with a \"mild\" bipolar disorder, and such a diagnosis is suggested by impulsivity and mood-instability. Previously, majority of research on the comorbidity between eating and affective disorders focused on depressive symptomatology, however difficulties in the reliable assessment of hypomania may obfuscate the estimation of the co-occurrence of eating disorders with BS. Epidemiological studies suggest the association between BS and eating disorders with binge episodes (bulimia nervosa, anorexia- bulimic type and EDNOS with binge episodes). Co-occurrence of such disorders with depressive symptoms probably suggests the diagnosis of BS, not recurrent depression. Bulimic behaviours, impulsivity and affective disorders might be related to the impairment of the serotonergic neurotransmission, which may result from the genetic vulnerability and early life trauma. Currently, the first-line pharmacological treatment of co-occurring eating disorders with binge episodes and BS are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However in some cases, the use of mood-stabilising agents as monotherapy or in combination with serotonergic drugs may be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "title": "Sympathetic activation by obstructive sleep apnea: a challenging ‘off-label’ meta-analysis",
      "abstract": "A single occurrence of obstructive apnea during sleep will trigger sequential hemodynamic, chemical and cortical perturbations that collectively elicit surges in central sympathetic outflow, neural norepinephrine release and blood pressure; these ebb once breathing resumes [1–3]. Left untreated over months or years, the cumulative burden of scores or hundreds of such events nightly elicits sustained autonomic after-effects, apparent during wakefulness [3]. Relative to healthy individuals, vagal heart rate modulation of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is reduced [4], their blood pressure variability is increased [4] and their muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is substantially greater than predicted by their age, sex, or body mass index (BMI) [3–6], with sympathetic firing incidence during quiet rest directly proportional to the frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI) [7], a conventional measure of OSA severity [8]. In a randomized trial in which continuous positive airway pressure abolished OSA, 1 month of treatment eliminated this daytime sympathetic excess [9]. This upward setting, by chronic untreated OSA, of MSNA during wakefulness has been attributed to long-term structural or functional neural adaptations to hypoxia and oxygen free radical generation evoked by recurring apneas and hypopneas during sleep. Such autonomic neuroplasticity involves both oxygen sensing components of the peripheral chemoreceptor and specific cortical and brain-stem regions participating in the generation or modulation of efferent vagal and sympathetic nerve discharge [10–17]. Peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity to hypoxia is augmented [10]. The left dorsal posterior insula thins, proportionate to hypoxia severity, whereas the left mid-cingulate cortex and both thalami thicken; the magnitude of such thickening correlates positively with MSNA burst incidence during wakefulness [17]. Current published literature concerning the MSNA of patients with OSA comprises case–control, mechanistic or interventional studies of relatively small cohort size. Many originate from the same laboratory, with each addressing a singular hypothesis. In a recent issue of the journal, Quarti-Trevano and colleagues [18] offered a systematic review and meta-analysis of such data, with three specific aims: to determine whether such daytime sympathetic activation coheres to OSA rather than concomitant co-morbidities also characterized by autonomic perturbations; if the magnitude of sympathetic activation is directly proportional to the AHI; and whether heart rate adds clinical value, as a surrogate to microneurography (essentially a research probe) as a signal of both sympathetic activation and OSA severity. Although the frequency and severity of apnea-induced hypoxia [19] and the frequency of arousal from sleep [20] are arguably more causal of chronic sympathetic excitation during wakefulness, the majority of microneurographic studies report only the AHI. Quarti-Trevano et al.[18] accomplished admirably all three aims, demonstrating: an incremental increase in daytime MSNA burst incidence with each grade of OSA severity; a significant positive correlation between MSNA and the AHI, independent of body weight or BMI; and direct significant correlations between heart rate and both MSNA and the AHI. They concluded that OSA is itself a state of chronic sympathetic activation, regardless of co-morbidities and therefore an appropriate target of interventions designed to restore autonomic equilibrium. These authors merit congratulation not only for establishing these concepts convincingly but in particular for their thoughtful subsequent management of the challenges encountered in the course of this endeavor [21]. Meta-analyses were initially designed, introduced to the clinical literature and adopted enthusiastically by practitioners because of their capacity to estimate effect sizes and confidence intervals of interventions evaluated in randomized controlled trials of cohort sizes that individually might have been insufficient to reject equipoise. Fundamental principles included the uniqueness of study participants and randomization, to minimize the influence of unknown but potentially important confounding variables. Later, non-randomized studies were introduced to meta-analyses, with the caveat that ensuing risk of bias was amplified and often inestimable. Quarti-Trevano et al.'s systematic review of the English language literature identified 16 pertinent cross-sectional studies, 7 prospective studies and 3 clinical trials, comprising 528 patients with sleep apnea and 268 healthy controls [18]. However, in the analysis and synthesis of such data, it transpired that these numbers were not singular. More often than not, the same patient and control data were presented in two or more studies (in once instance, the same 25 OSA patient data appeared in 5 publications concerning different mechanistic hypotheses; Vaughan Macefield, personal communication) – but the authors had no means of establishing such precisely and, accordingly, eliminating each redundant entry. To lessen the likelihood of duplication, they then excluded 12 of the 26 first-pass articles [21]. According to their Table S4 [21], if one sums the number of participants reported for each, the revisited meta-analysis comprises 365 OSA patients and 165 controls. But are all data in this smaller pool derived from unique individuals? Since several laboratories were represented by more than one publication (often reporting rather similar cohort mean data), likely not. The magnitude of redundancy within this residue cannot be established without access to primary source participant-level data. According to Table S4 in their updated work [21], the mean MSNA burst incidence in those with OSA (mean AHI 36.2 events/h) was 63.6 bursts/100 heart beats whereas in the control group (age difference) (mean AHI stated to be 1 event/h) this was 45.8 bursts/100 heart beats. Assuming, as a thought experiment, that these group means are not weighted by double or triple counting of specific individuals’ data points, let us then ask: is this differential excess of ∼40% on average an overestimate, an underestimate, or a fair approximation of the magnitude of central upregulation of sympathetic outflow induced by months or years of quotidian cycles of apnea, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and arousal during sleep? Because the control group was on average 5.4 years younger, normative data concerning the influence of age on MSNA [6] would posit an overestimate. Also, at their average age, any overestimate would be augmented if there were disproportionately more women in the control population than in the OSA cohort [6]. Biffi et al.[21] identified participant sex in their review of primary sources, but did not report separately the net number of men and women represented by these 14 publications. Conversely, considering the positive linear relationship illustrated in the authors’ revisited Figure 5 [21], had these controls more than 1 apneic event/h on average, the impact of OSA might have been underestimated. Of the 14 studies compiled, approximately 1/4 reported no controls; 1/4 selected controls based on good health and the absence of symptoms suggestive of OSA; 1/4 performed polysomnography on all participants but did not report the actual AHIs of those classified as controls, and 1/4 performed polysomnography on all participants and reported the AHIs of all participants. In the latter, a surprising number of community-based volunteers who had no symptoms or foreknowledge of sleep apnea had mild, moderate, or even severe OSA. Thus, 2 studies from 1 laboratory reported, for controls, mean AHIs of 7 [22] and 8 [23] events/h and mean arousal indices of 21 [22] and 21 [23] events/h; 2 publications from our program (with considerable participant redundancy) reported, for controls, mean AHIs of 6 [7] and 8 events/h [20] and a mean arousal index of 20 events/h [20]. On the basis of this finding of non-zero AHI from healthy asymptomatic individuals from two independent laboratories, it is extremely unlikely that the AHI of all of the control subjects, whether polysomnography was not performed, or performed, but the findings not disclosed, was zero. If the mean AHIs of these control cohorts were indeed >0, then both meta-analyses [18,21] may have underestimated the true impact of OSA on MSNA. Importantly, the present data are specific to the resting state. Combining blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging and microneurography, our group detected no difference between individuals with no or mild OSA and with moderate or severe OSA [7] in the magnitudes of increases in BOLD signaling in cortical autonomic regions or in sympathetic nerve firing when obstructive apnea was simulated by a brief series of Muller maneuvers [24]. These considerations aside, the four key insights from this arduous scholarly effort are: OSA is a condition of sympathetic excess during wakefulness, regardless of patient co-morbidities; the magnitude of daytime sympathetic excitation is directly proportional to the frequency of apneas plus hypopneas during sleep; it should not be presumed, without validation by polysomnography, that lean individuals, self-reported as healthy, are without OSA; and, when assembling the findings of multiple studies from the same laboratory, addressing, appropriately, distinctly different questions, the high risk of aggregating data that do not originate from unique individuals should serve as a caution for those embarking on similar meta-analyses.

This abandonment contributes to the big risk of unchain psychiatric pictures as depression, anxyet disturbs, drugs and alcoholic excessive consumption and alimentary disturbs. Obeses of the general population do not present more psychological or psychiatric symptoms than the clinical population of obeses (obeses under treatment), present more clinical and psychiatric problems, mainly compulsory alimentary standards.

      "title": "Eating Disorders and Psychosis as Intertwined Dimensions of Disembodiment: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Although psychosis is not one of the most commonly recognized psychiatric comorbidities of Eating Disorders (ED), there is an increasing empirical evidence of associations between these psychopathological conditions. Indeed, ED as well as early manifestations of schizophrenic psychosis emerge during developmental years and might present some affinities in the presentation at onset. For example, adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) may report psychotic-like eating-related symptoms such as delusional-like body image distortions and/or \"anorexic voice\". Conversely, early expressions of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability might involve altered bodily experiences, delusional ideation on food and eating as well as pseudo-anorectic behaviors. From a phenomenological perspective, this partial symptomatic overlap may lie on common features of disturbed corporeality in terms of disembodiment, although these alterations of embodiment are presumably rooted in distinct pathogenetic pathways (e.g., primary childhood ontogenetic pathway in schizophrenia vs. a secondary adolescent ontogenetic pathway in AN). A clinical-phenomenological attitude could be important not only to better discern potential overlaps and affinities between the two conditions, but also to better conceptualize and treat those background alterations of the embodied self. In particular, a phenomenological exploration of the experiential side of eating-related behaviors could be a decisive step to support early differential diagnosis and treatment appropriateness.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

      "title": "Role of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic plasticity in drug addiction",
      "abstract": "Substance dependence is characterized by a group of symptoms, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). These symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal, drug consumption for alleviating withdrawal, exaggerated consumption beyond original intention, failure to reduce drug consumption, expending a considerable amount of time obtaining or recovering from the substance's effects, disregard of basic aspects of life (for example, family), and maintenance of drug consumption, despite facing adverse consequences. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a brain structure located in the basal forebrain of vertebrates, and it has been the target of addictive drugs. Different neurotransmitter systems at the level of the NAc circuitry have been linked to the different problems of drug addiction, like compulsive use and relapse. The glutamate system has been linked mainly to relapse after drug-seeking extinction. The dopamine system has been linked mainly to compulsive drug use. The glutamate homeostasis hypothesis centers around the dynamics of synaptic and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate, and their impact on circuitry from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the NAc. After repetitive drug use, deregulation of this homeostasis increases the release of glutamate from the PFC to the NAc during drug relapse. Glial cells also play a fundamental role in this hypothesis; glial cells shape the interactions between the PFC and the NAc by means of altering glutamate levels in synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces. On the other hand, cocaine self-administration and withdrawal increases the surface expression of subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors at the level of the NAc. Also, cocaine self-administration and withdrawal induce the formation of subunit glutamate receptor 2 (GluA2), lacking the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) at the level of the NAc. Antagonism of the CP-AMPARs reduces cravings. It is necessary to pursue further exploration of the AMPA receptor subunit composition and variations at the level of the NAc for a better understanding of glutamatergic plastic changes. It is known that cocaine and morphine are able to induce changes in dendritic spine morphology by modifying actin cycling. These changes include an initial increase in spine head diameter and increases in AMPA receptor expression, followed by a second stage of spine head diameter retraction and reduction of the AMPA receptors' expression in spines. Besides glutamate and dopamine, other factors, like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can influence NAc activity and induce changes in dendritic spine density. BDNF also induces drug-related behaviors like self-administration and relapse. Neither apoptosis nor neurogenesis plays a relevant role in the neurobiological processes subjacent to cocaine addiction in adults (rodent or human). Different therapeutic drugs like N-acetylcysteine (NAC), modafinil, acamprosate, and topiramate have been tested in preclinical and/or clinical models for alleviating drug relapse. Moreover, these therapeutic drugs target the glutamatergic circuitry between the PFC and the NAc. NAC and acamprosate have shown inconsistent results in clinical trials. Modafinil and topiramate have shown some success, but more clinical trials are necessary. Based on the current review findings, it could be recommendable to explore therapeutic approaches that include synergism between different drugs and neurotransmitter systems. The discrepancy in the results of some therapeutic drugs between preclinical versus clinical trials for alleviating relapse or drug dependence could be linked to the scarce exploration of preclinical models that mimic polydrug abuse patterns, for example, cocaine plus alcohol. At the clinical level, the pattern of polydrug consumption is a phenomenon of considerable frequency. Finally, as a complement at the end, an updated summary is included about the role of glutamate in other neuropsychiatric disorders (for example, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and others).",

The assessment of SE is based on history (familial predisposition and emotional standpoint), sleep habits, and also on physical examination. There is a strong genetic influence in SE; when both parents suffer from SE, almost 75% of their children are expected to be also enuretic, while the prevalence of SE in the offspring of two parents who were not enuretic during childhood is only 15%. Several polysomnographic studies reported that children with SE have normal sleep architecture, in terms of proportion and distribution of sleep stages during night. The management of primary enuresis starts from the education of the patient and family including: supportive approach, evening fluid restriction, and sleep hygiene rules.",

Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

Assessment should cover domains such as body stores of energy and protein, food intake, performance status, and factors resulting in excess catabolism. Intervention should be early rather than late, informed by the assessment process and focused on a multimodal approach (nutrition, exercise, and pharmacological agents).

      "abstract": "Endocrine Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa Abstract. Anorexia nervosa is a perilous disease of unknown etiology that causes a variety of endocrine effects. Characteristic for anorexia nervosa are a reduced food intake and thus significant underweight, as well as the fear of gaining weight. Often sufferers also have a distorted self-perception, the urge to move and amenorrhea. AN is difficult to treat and often has a chronic course, and is associated with an increased mortality risk. The endocrinological changes occur in several endocrine axes, their extent is related to the degree of malnutrition. Low leptin levels, due to the underweight, signal a potentially dangerous lack of energy to the brain. There is a cascade of neuroendocrine adaptive responses to help the organism to survive. The effects of starvation are extensive, affecting the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, as well as the adrenal glands, gonads and bones. In positive cases, most dysfunctions are reversible; the compromised bone stability recovers only slowly.Zusammenfassung. Anorexia nervosa ist eine gefährliche Krankheit mit noch unbekannter Ätiologie, die eine Vielzahl von endokrinen Auswirkungen verursacht. Charakteristisch für Anorexia nervosa sind eine reduzierte Nahrungsaufnahme und dadurch deutliches Untergewicht, sowie die Angst vor Gewichtszunahme. Oft haben Betroffene auch eine verzerrte Selbstwahrnehmung, Bewegungsdrang und eine ausbleibende Regelblutung. Anorexia nervosa ist schwierig zu behandeln, hat einen oft chronischen Verlauf und ist mit einem erhöhten Mortalitätsrisiko verbunden. Die endokrinologischen Veränderungen treten in mehreren endokrinen Achsen auf, ihr Ausmass hängt mit dem Grad der Unterernährung zusammen. Ein niedriger Leptin-Serumspiegel, bedingt durch das Untergewicht, signalisiert dem Gehirn einen potenziell gefährlichen Energiemangel. Es kommt zu einer Kaskade von neuroendokrinen Anpassungsreaktionen, um dem Organismus das Überleben zu sichern. Die Auswirkungen des Hungerzustandes sind weitreichend und beeinträchtigen Hypophyse, Schilddrüse, Nebennieren, Gonaden und Knochen. Bei positiven Verläufen sind die meisten Dysfunktionen reversibel; die kompromittierte Knochenstabilität kann sich nur zögerlich erholen.",

Observandose que no es un proceso unitario y que no afecta por igual a todos los pacientes. Se aplico a una muestra de 38 participantes (media edad: 48,69 De: 8,70) que sufrian de negligencia visuoespacial tras un ictus hemisferico derecho una bateria de exploracion visuoespacial, dividiendolos en tres perfiles de afectacion (leve, moderado y grave) mediante clustering jerarquico. Aplicandose un paradigma experimental denominado Paradigma de Atenciones Multiples en conjuncion a un eye-tracker tanto a los participantes del grupo experimental, como a un grupo normativo formado por 21 sujetos (media edad: 45,57 De:10,17) sin afectacion cognitiva. La aplicacion de este set experimental de paradigma y eye-tracker se realizaba antes y despues del tratamiento neurorehabilitador realizado en el Institut Guttmann. El paradigma experimental consistia en la respuesta manual ante un estimulo (una X de color negro) de aparicion repentina en diferentes posiciones en el espacio (a lo largo de 5 columnas). Con este paradigma experimental y la tecnologia de eye-tracking se buscaba estudiar la capacidad de captura atencional, asi como la velocidad de captura y respuesta que se muestra afectada tras un ictus hemisferico derecho. En el analisis pre-tratamiento los tres perfiles muestran respuesta diferentes, siendo el perfil grave el que tiene una peor captura atencional y menor velocidad de respuesta ante estimulos en el hemicampo izquierdo. Sin cambios en la velocidad de captura y en la rectitud de busqueda de un estimulo. Mostrando estos participantes diagnosticados de negligencia espacial una capacidad de captura atencional en el hemicampo izquierdo, pero diferente en funcion de su grado de afectacion atencional. Tras el tratamiento neurorehabilitador intensivo se observa una mejora de la captura atencional en el hemicampo izquierdo de todos los perfiles, con un incremento de la captura y mejora de la velocidad de repuesta del perfil grave en el hemicampo izquierdo. Los resultados de este estudio indican la importancia de la clasificacion del grado de afectacion de la negligencia espacial, ya que no todos los pacientes diagnosticados de negligencia espacial se comportan de similar manera. Asi mismo estos sujetos muestran una diferente capacidad de captura atencional y velocidad de captura y respuesta que no es observada en las pruebas de exploracion neuropsicologica. Siendo necesaria una valoracion de estos aspectos debido a su influencia en el sindrome de negligencia y en su rehabilitacion.

      "title": "Children Who Starve Themselves: Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Although the 15 children in this study fit into the classic picture of anorexia nervosa, the title of the report is a misnomer, since none of the patients experienced marked anorexia. The failure to eat resulted from fear of eating, rather than loss of appetite. Previous workers are in agreement that this disorder represents a syndrome rather than a disease entity and that it may occur in people with various types of personalities and various degrees of ego strength. While many bizarre fantasies are associated in the patients' minds with the eating disturbance, the literature does not contain information about why, in these patients, such fantasies become associated with enough anxiety and guilt to require the defense of not eating. Our patients denied that they were starving themselves to the point of emaciation, were greatly preoccupied with food during their illnesses, and often served food to the other children on the ward. Preconscious and conscious fantasies relating to food and eating included animistic ideas about food, delusions that certain kinds of food were poisonous, fear of oral impregnation and gastric pregnancy, ideas of anal birth, orally aggressive and sometimes cannibalistic impulses, and the equation of not eating with a lifelong childlike dependent status. We had expected to find more evidence of repression of the fantasies connected with eating. We now believe isolation of affect was the chief defense mechanism that permitted such bizarre ideas to remain accessible to awareness. Open conflict between the mothers and grandmothers of many of our patients was a prominent factor during the patients' infancies. The children often recreated this conflict, using food as the bone of contention, while they were ill. The anxiety-laden fantasies about food and eating, preoccupation with food, fear of adult sexuality, and reluctance to give up the child's dependent status that were present in our patients often paralleled identical fantasies and attitudes of their parents. Contrary to our expectations, we obtained a history of early feeding disturbances in only 8 patients and have discussed the possible significance of this finding. The events that precipitated anorexia nervosa in these children do not differ from those associated with other psychological disorders. The connection between the precipitating events and the specific symptom of not eating only becomes evident in the context of the child's fantasies or the family myths shared by the child. None of these girls menstruated during anorexia; starvation is not the major factor in producing the amenorrhea. Our patients showed a high degree of anxiety about the menses and other sexual functions. The link between menstrual function and anorexia appeared most typically as amenorrhea pregnancy, or amenorrhea and not eating equals regression to babyhood. Manifest depression, present in all but 2 patients, differs from classic clinical depression. This finding is consistent with previous observations that children, in general, do not show classic depression. Efforts to formulate the anorexia syndrome exclusively in terms of the dynamics of depression have failed. Regression is as characteristic of anorexia nervosa as is depression. While regression is characteristic of children with psychiatric disorders in general, and also of children with physical illnesses, our patients seemed more deeply regressed than children with any other psychological disorder (except psychosis) and also more deeply regressed than other physically ill children. We have discussed how the particularly severe ambivalence present in the parents of these children may foster a particularly deep regression in the child. Lastly, we have noted some factors that seem related to the outcome of this syndrome.",

Potential etiologies of unresponsiveness with shaking or stiffening include seizure (whether provoked or unprovoked), convulsive syncope, and psychogenic spells. Epileptic seizures tend to be highly stereotyped and sporadic, unpredictable, and brief, with the majority lasting less than 1–2 minutes. The labored and slow postictal breathing and the location of this patient's tongue injury are consistent with a generalized tonic or tonic-clonic seizure; however, the history is not sufficient to differentiate a primary versus secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The differential diagnosis in this patient therefore includes focal seizures that evolve to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure such as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy versus a genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) such as juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, or epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA).",

      "title": "Fluoxetine Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "ANOREXIA NERVOSA IS A SEVERE,TREATMENT-RESISTANT illness primarily affecting women. It has one of the highest all-cause mortalities, and the highest suicide rate of any psychiatric illness. Restriction of food intake, refusal to maintain adequate body weight, and disturbed thinking about food, weight, and body image are hallmarks of this illness. A prominent associated feature is profoundambivalenceabout therapeuticefforts (whethernutritional, psychological, or pharmacological) aimed at weight restoration. In addition to the classic pattern of extreme food restriction, a subset of patients also report binge eating and purgingbehaviors (the“binge-purgesubtype”).Co-occurring psychopathologyiscommon,especiallydepression,obsessivecompulsive disorder, and other anxiety disorders. In severely malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa, nutritional rehabilitation with weight restoration is the cornerstone of treatment, and this intervention often requires hospitalization. Psychotherapy is also a regular part of treatment. Preliminary evidence supports use of a specific familybased psychotherapy in adolescents with anorexia nervosa who still reside at home; effective alternative psychotherapies for adolescents have not yet been determined. For adults with anorexia nervosa there is some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy, and other potential psychotherapies for adults are in development. Psychopharmacology is also a common treatment strategy, although the evidence base for psychopharmacologic approaches for anorexia nervosa is quite limited. The existing literature on pharmacotherapy for anorexia nervosa is modest in size and striking for the diversity of medications that have been studied. Agents as diverse as lithium, various antipsychotics, cyproheptadine, tricyclic antidepressants, and tetrahydrocannabinol have been examined with generally negative results in small trials. This wide diversity of agents is clearly an indication of the remarkable challenges inherent in treating individuals who have anorexia nervosa, and also reflects the generally negative results to date in pharmacotherapy trials for this illness. Recently, there has been much interest in the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for acute treatment and relapse prevention in anorexia nervosa. Trials of acute treatment (ie, while patients are still at low weight) with fluoxetine have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit. Modestsized studies of fluoxetine for anorexia nervosa relapse prevention (after an initial weight gain) have shown both positive (n=35) and negative (n=33) results. In this issue of JAMA, Walsh and colleagues report the results of a placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in the relapse prevention treatment of anorexia nervosa. Participants were 93 women aged 16 to 45 years who were completing multimodal inpatient or day hospital treatment and had weight restoration to a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of at least 19.0. The patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or fluoxetine, with a dosage goal of 60 mg/d (with decreases permitted for adverse effects and an increase to 80 mg/d permitted for clinical deterioration). A total of 12 months of treatment was provided, during which time all patients also received cognitive behavioral therapy. Relapse was defined as weight loss to a body mass index less than 16.5 or development of medical complications or imminent suicide risk or the onset of another severe psychiatric disorder. The results of the trial by Walsh et al did not support efficacy for fluoxetine in relapse prevention for anorexia nervosa. Response to fluoxetine was not different from placebo, whether measured in time-to-relapse, percentage of patients maintaining a body mass index of 18.5 or higher, or the percentage of patients meeting modified Morgan-Russell criteria for at least fair outcome (Morgan-Russell criteria provide a slightly broader assessment of anorexia nervosa treatment outcome, extending beyond simple weight restoration). Responsebysubtypeofanorexianervosa(restrictingvsbingepurge) was also examined. The authors note that since a previous fluoxetine trial with positive findings enrolled only participantswith therestrictingsubtypeofanorexianervosa, perhaps this subtype would respond to fluoxetine.

It is divided into two parts: nerve conduction studies, and needle electromyography. It is possible that pain can be present in the absence of neuromuscular disorders as in soft tissue or arthritic pathologies. The nerve conduction studies are entirely objective and do not require active participation by the subject. During this procedure, the nerves are stimulated at different current intensities with a handheld stimulator. There are two components to the definition of malingering. First, the symptoms must be invented or exaggerated. Second, that this is done deliberately for the purposes of gain. The only component of the electrodiagnostic exam, which is affected in cases of hysteria or malingering, is the firing pattern of the motor unit potentials: either there is no activation at all, or they fire in decreased numbers at a slow rate or in poorly synchronized groups in a tremorous fashion.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang.

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "title": "Cyclothymic temperament and/or borderline personality disorder",
      "abstract": "Many patients within the Bipolar spectrum, especially when recurrence is high and the inter-episodic period is not free of affective manifestations, may meet criteria for personality disorders. This is particularly true for cyclothymic patients, who are often misclassified as borderline personality disorder because of their extreme mood instability and reactivity. In patients with cyclothymic temperament, lifetime comorbidity with anxiety disorders, in particular panic disorder-agoraphobia, bulimia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, alcohol and substance abuse disorder and both cluster C (anxious) and cluster B (dramatic) personality disorders, is the rule rather than the exception [1]. In particular, a large proportion of these patients meet DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorders. Cyclothymic-bipolar II-borderline patients display a long-lasting hyper-reactivity to many psychological (i.e, rejection, separation) and physical (i.e., food, light, drugs) stimuli. This marked reactivity of mood could also explain the frequent concomitance of impulse control disorder and substances and alcohol abuse. An analysis of the explanatory power of affective temperaments and personality disorders for each of the criteria of BPD (Perugi et al., in press) revealed that the presence of cyclothymic temperament explains much of the relationship between bipolar II disorder and BPD. The diagnosis of BPD in these patients was favored by the coexistence of an affective cyclothymic temperamental dysregulation coexisting with anxious-dependent traits. We find no reason to separate bipolar II with cyclothymic instability from the stable instability of the borderline type, because mood lability is a common characteristic of both sets of disorders. Further, correlational analyses [2] indicate that in bipolar II atypical depressives mood reactivity and interpersonal sensitivity traits might be related constructs with a cyclothymic temperamental matrix.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

Recently non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed more often, among which stimulus control. One of the stimulus control instructions is the advice not to nap in the daytime, based on the assumption that napping affects sleep quality the following night, due to a decrease of sleep need. This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep. Consequently, the assumption on which the advice against napping is based is wrong.",

      "title": "Chronobiology and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Binge eating disorder(BED) is the most common eating disorder that mainly affects young women. BED often occurs in the patients with psychiatric disorders and relates to the impairment in psychosocial functioning (home, work, personal life, or social life). Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for the BED patients. However, only 50% of BED patients can benefit from psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy has less effect than psychotherapy. Here, we report a case with extremely severe BED, whose discomforts were almost disappeared after taking only herbal formula based on Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) for 2 months. Case presentation The case reported was a man aged 73 years who fitted the diagnosis of extremely severe BED. He ate a lot every meal, didn’t stop eating until he felt the extreme discomfort of abdominal distension, and ate more than ten meals every day. Only could an enema every day improve his constipation and the extreme discomfort of abdominal distension. He was transferred to dozens of hospitals because of the disease and had tried a variety of treatments, which had no effect on him. Here, we described in detail his medical history and treatment process. At last, his clinical symptoms were controlled and had no side-effect. Conclusion Besides psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, herbal formula based on TCM can be an alternative therapy for severe intractable BED patients. Level of evidence Level V, case report.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

      "abstract": "Mental health' and 'mental illness' are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. Amental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples' lives in different ways. Just as it's possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it's entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That's because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times ('episodes') of ill health and times of better or good health. With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they dene well—and nd meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals. Objectives 1.To identify the knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness in community among the ASHAworkers in Kasaba Bawada, Kolhapur. Methodolgy: A non-experimental descriptive survey design was used for the study. Non probability purposive sampling technique was used to select 60 samples. Data collection was done using structured knowledge questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using descriptive (mean, S.D, Frequency and Percentage). The majority of the workers 40 (66.67%) belonged to the age group 31-40 years and minimum 08 (13.33%) workers belong to age group 41-50 years. The maximum of the workers 54 (90.00%) belonged to Hindu religion, and the remaining 6(10.00%) belonged to Muslim and Other religion. Maximum workers 56(93.34%) were married, and remaining 4 (6.66%) were widowed. Majority of the workers 28 (46.66%) studied till SSC and minimum 2 (3.34%) studied till graduation. Maximum 46 (76%) workers have poor knowledge and 13 (22%) have average knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness. Conclusion:The project work concludes that maximum workers have poor knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness, so there is need to focus on awareness of mental health among all the ASHAworkers.",

It is defined as the persistent intake of non-nutritional substances for at least one month, in an inappropriate way from an evolutionary perspective, and provided that its practice is not culturally banned. Many animal species, including primates, have this behavior. Documented from antiquity, in most cases it has been considered a symptom of another related disorder rather than as independent condition. Its prevalence is unknown. It is mainly described in mentally disabled people, pregnant women, autism, mentally ill patients, children, and others. The ingestion of earth, ice, starch, ropes, wood, and other products has been observed, although some authors also include the obsessive and reiterative consumption of eatable substances. Geophagia is considered a cultural phenomenon, although sometimes may lead to disease, and an form of paleomedicine or paleonutrition. The etiology of pica is unknown and it has no markers. Sensitive, digestive, nutritional, psychological, and psychiatric factors have been implicated in its origin and maintenance. Although the morbimortality is unknown and difficult to study, we may highlight intoxications, parasitic diseases, and surgical abdomen with serious complications. Finally, as in other eating behavior disorders, the global management of this entity requires a coordinated intervention of different health care professionals.",

The initial stable levodopa benefit, termed the “long-duration response,” begins to give way to responses increasingly tied to each dose, the so-called “short-duration response.” During the initial treatment years when long duration responses predominate, the timing of the doses is not important, except for taking them without food; doses can be missed without a decline in benefit. However, after several years or longer, the benefit begins to fluctuate; the response develops within an hour or so after each dose, persists for a few hours or less, and then declines. This concept is graphically depicted in figure 17.1. Occasional patients with long-standing Parkinson’s disease (PD) will experience responses lasting only 1–2 hours, which mirrors the plasma levodopa half-life of 1.5–2 hours.",

However, a robust neural system need not be a rigid circuit. Neuroplasticity enables appropriate adaptations to frequent or chronic disturbances that initiate active modifications in respiratory control such as weight gain or loss, altitude exposure or injury [1]. Studies of respiratory plasticity are intended to reveal how and why experience or changing conditions influence the control of breathing. Further, the respiratory system provides an ideal model to explore fundamental mechanisms of neuroplasticity for at least two reasons. First, the respiratory neural control networks produce a spontaneous rhythmic and quantifiable motor output under a wide range of in vivo and in vitro conditions. Second, clear functional significance can be ascribed to respiratory motor output: it represents breathing. Many influential models of neuroplasticity (e.g., hippocampal long-term potentiation; [2,3]) lack these advantages.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal drowsiness during the day is defined on the basis of three criteria: 1. subjective feeling of increased tiredness, 2. objective observation of attacks of falling asleep, 3. detection of premature falling asleep in the multiple sleep latency test. About 3 to 4% of the population of modern industrial countries complain of this symptom which very quickly leads to inability to work in numerous occupations (driving instructors, lorry drivers, airline pilots). In many cases, the symptoms can be eliminated by effective methods of treatment. Early diagnosis and therapy is hence an important task of physicians. Clinically suitable tools and methods of measurement for appraising the phenomena are at present: 1. the multiple sleep latency test (Richardson et al., 1978), 2. the multiple staying awake test (Mitler et al., 1982), 3. the vigilance test according to Quatember and Maly from the Vienna test system. In neurophysiological terms, an attempt is made to differentiate between: REM drowsiness, non-REM drowsiness, hypofunction of the arousal systems of the reticular formation, and hyperfunction and overstimulation of the arousal systems of the reticular formation (over-aroused tiredness). Approaches to a clinical typology of abnormal drowsiness are available from two points of departure: 1. Forms of permanent somnolence which are not alleviated but intensified by a brief restorative sleep and resemble the 'oversleeping syndrome' of the healthy individual. 2. Attacks of imperative falling asleep in narcoleptic patients. The characteristic of this form of abnormal drowsiness during the day is that in the interval between the attacks of falling asleep patients can take on any healthy person with regard to alertness, reaction capacity and ready wit. After a brief restorative sleep of less than 5 min., they immediately feel fresh, alert and fit again.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "abstract": "Extract Differential diagnosis True emergencies Urgent presentations Timely assessment Introduction Alternatively referred to as convulsions or seizures, fits are a symptom not a condition. Patients often present as an emergency due to the sudden spontaneous onset and anxiety the fit may cause in witnesses. Fits occur as a result of sudden disorganized electrical activity in the brain. They normally last between 30sec and 2min. The effect upon the individual will depend on the area and extent of the brain involved. Most authors prefer the term ‘seizure’ as the word ‘fit’ has differing connotations; ‘to have a fit’ may be used to describe anger or loss of temper. There are many causes of seizures which can be classified into five main groups: 1. Cerebral irritation 2. Metabolic disorders 3. Substance withdrawal 4. Idiopathic 5. Pseudo-seizures Regardless of the classification all seizures require a consistent approach to assessment. Key signs and symptoms The symptoms of seizures vary widely between individual patients. They may include:",

      "abstract": "Introduction: \"Swasthasya Swasthya Rakshanam, Aturasya Vikara Prashamanam,\" or \"Maintaining the normal health status of the body and curing the diseased,\" is the original purpose of the science of Ayurveda.A person may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms that point to various diseases.Thorough examination of patients not only help physician to diagnose the disease but also help in planning the treatment as well as predicting the prognosis.In Ayurveda Prameha is generally key symptoms like Prabhoota Mutrata, which means increased frequency and volume of urination, and Avila Mutrata, which means murky urine.Prameha is considered as Chirakaaleena vyadhi (chronic disease) which is Anushangi [1] (recurring) in nature.It is due to vitiation of tridoshas (vata-pittakapha) especially Kapha dosha which can be considered as important components of protoplasm [2] which governs all the activities of body and also represents the physico-biological characteristics of substances created by combining distinct Panchamahabhootas, namely Akasha (space), Vayu (electrons), Teja (energy), Jala (proton), and Prithvi (neutron) [3].Arista lakshanas are the warning signs and symptoms that death is imminent or that something fatal is close at hand.Understanding this Arista is crucial for good therapy since only when one is properly informed on the Ayu (life span) of the patient is the treatment effective.If a doctor uses Arista lakshanas to treat patients, this will have an impact on the doctor's Dhana (Money/Property), Yasha (Success/Fame), and Vidhya (Knowledge).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an uncommon clinical syndrome characterized by short‐term memory loss and disorientation that resolves in 24 h. Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

      "title": "Delayed Muscle Soreness: A Review",
      "abstract": "There are two generally recognized types of muscular pain or soreness associated with severe exercise. These two types are a) acute soreness and b) delayed soreness. Acute soreness or pain occurs during and immediately following exercise. This condition is short-lived and is alleviated when exercise is discontinued. Acute soreness is thought to be associated with lack of adequate blood flow or ischemia to the active muscles. The more serious problem associated with severe exercise is delayed muscle soreness, i.e., pain and soreness that occurs 24 to 48 hours after exercise. Four popular theories of the etiology of this condition are: lactic acid accumulation, spasms, torn tissue, and connective tissue damage. These theories are discussed in light of current biochemical and morphological findings. From recent studies designed to induce delayed soreness, it has been found that the degree of delayed soreness experienced with exercise is related to the type of muscle contraction performed. Maximum soreness is associated with eccentric types of contractions. A possible explanation for this finding is presented.",

Tonic seizures are usually short duration (less than 1 min), and characterized by rapid onset, and increased muscle tone in extensor muscles. This causes a fall if the patient is not seated. Postictal depression is common, with associated headache and confusion. Tonic seizures are a frequent feature of the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, along with other seizure types. The Lennox–Gastaut syndrome represents as many as 4% of all childhood epilepsies (Kramer et al. 1998). Tonic seizures are the most prevalent seizure type in Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, accounting for more than one-half of seizures (Aicardi 1988).",

The condition may cause an internal fever, stomach pains, and possibly great thirst. Children suffer the most from this folk illness because they may not chew their food well, swallow gum, or otherwise not eat well. Some believe it can be caused by forcing children to eat food they don’t like. It is not an illness that is caused or can be treated by witchcraft. This condition is not always recognized by Western doctors, and Mexican Americans may seek the help of a curandero, or a sobador, a person who knows how to massage. A sobador may massage the abdomen or the back behind the stomach to dislodge the food that is stuck. Usually, family members know how to treat a condition like empacho, by either giving a laxative to clean out the stomach, giving an herb tea such as yerba buena (mint) or manzanilla (chamomile), or stroking the stomach with olive oil.",

It is due to a jelling process that occurs during rest and that must be reversed before normal function can be resumed comfortably. I interpret the manifestation, which may be named postinertial dyskinesia, to be indicative of a ligamentous reaction rather than a bone abnormality. If one were to watch a group of persons arise after a card game or watch passengers get out of a bus or auto after a long, uninterrupted ride, he would observe that a certain number of them move about in a stiff, awkward, and frequently painful manner. This postinertial dyskinesia is very common in persons over 60 years of age after physical activity such as golf. The condition persists for a variable",

      "title": "MCQ on Neonatology",
      "abstract": "Theme: Neonatology 1. A 25-day term male baby with a birth weight of 3 kg came to the emergency with the mother complaining of vomiting and sudden episodes of bizarre head and neck movements with complete arching of the back lasting for few seconds, mostly during or after feeding, since day 2 of life. His physical, neurological examinations, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis? Infantile torticollis Infantile spasm Sandifer syndrome Kernicterus. Answer: C-Sandifer syndrome. Explanation Sandifer syndrome is presented with spasmodic torsional dystonia with arching of the back and rigid opisthotonic posturing, associated with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, or hiatal hernia. The stiffening episodes are shown to be temporally associated with food intake and characteristically absent during sleep. Barium swallow study can be done to look for gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia. Nonpharmacological measures as the positioning of the head, feeding modifications, and drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be given. In case of failure of medical therapy, surgical correction with fundoplication can be done.[1] Although infantile torticollis also presents with dystonia, it has no relation with feeding in particular. In infantile spasm, a form of epilepsy, abnormal movements occur in clusters each lasting 5–10 s most commonly just after a baby wakes up. It is associated with developmental impairment and characteristic EEG changes of hypsarrhythmia. In kernicterus, the baby is icteric with abnormal neurological examination. 2. Gastric juice pH of newborns is: 1.4 2.1 5.0 7.0. Answer: C-7.0. Explanation At birth, due to ingestion of amniotic fluid, which has a neutral pH, irrespective of gestational age (preterm or term), the pH is alkaline and is maintained at 7.05.[2] 3. A 6 days old is being examined, while checking reflexes, a brisk Moro reflex is noted. Which of the following may be a cause? Kernicterus Stage 3 HIE Hypoglycemia Erb’s Palsy. Answer: C-Hypoglycemia. Brisk Moro reflex is usually associated with neonatal hypoglycemia: other rare causes being neonatal withdrawal syndrome, microcephaly, and hydranencephaly.[3] In kernicterus and HIE 3, Moro reflex is absent whereas Erb’s palsy results in asymmetrical Moro with inhibition of the reflex on the affected side. 4. A 4 weeks old exclusively breastfed infant came with complaints of persistent jaundice. On evaluation, the baby is icteric up to legs, alert, afebrile, and gaining weight with total serum bilirubin of 12.8 mg/dL (direct-0.6). Most appropriate management for this child Start phototherapy and stop breastfeeding Reassure mother and continue breastfeeding Perform liver function test and ultrasound of abdomen HIDA scan. Answer: B-reassure mother and continue breast feeding. This is a case of breast milk jaundice. It is a type of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in well-growing term infants which usually begins after the first 3–5 postnatal days, peaks by 2–3 weeks, and gradually resolves by 4–12 weeks. It does not cause kernicterus. It is thought to have a genetic predisposition and/or also related to b-glucuronidase present in breast milk that deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption. The benefits of breast milk outweigh the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and cessation of breastfeeding is not recommended.[4] 5. Enzyme replacement is done for: Niemann pick’s Gangliosidosis Gaucher’s disease Phenylketonuria. Answer: C–Gaucher’s disease. Explanation Gaucher’s disease is due to an inborn error of metabolism due to enzyme betaglucosidase deficiency leading to failure of degradation of glucocerebrosides. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) balances low levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme with a recombinant enzyme imiglucerase. However, it is effective against Type-I Gaucher’s disease and reverses the hematologic and visceral manifestations. Skeletal disease is slow to respond and pulmonary involvement is relatively resistant. This enzyme breaks down glucocerebroside, the fatty chemical that accumulates in the body of patients with Gaucher’s disease. (This compensates for the missing enzyme, which is why the therapy is called enzyme replacement.). Patients receive ERT through intravenous infusion, which usually takes 1–2 h. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first ERT in 1991.[5] 6. A term newborn with clear airways[11] [Figure 1], correctly positioned, and heart rate (HR) above 100/min is having labored breathing. Next step in management is:Figure 1: Courtesy: Department of Pediatrics, KIMS, KIIT, DU Start positive pressure ventilation Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Start chest compression Deep pharyngeal suction. Answer: B-Continuous positive airway pressure. Explanation As per recent NRP guidelines for babies with no apnea/gasping and HR >100/min with labored breathing suctioning of the airways with the attachment of a pulse oximeter is needed. Either oxygen through prong or CPAP can be then administered.[6] Deep pharyngeal suctioning is not advocated as it can damage tissue and stimulate a vagal response leading to apnea and bradycardia. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is recommended if after the initial steps, the baby is apneic/gasping or has HR <100/min. Even after the 30s of effective PPV when HR remains below 60/min, it warrants for bag and tube ventilation with chest compression. 7. A full term lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) born, previously healthy, 2-week-old female patient was brought to our outpatient department with bilateral breast enlargement and redness since birth and a history of some clear, nonbloody, and milk-like discharge from both the nipples. There was no history of maternal infections during the pregnancy. The neonate was afebrile with stable vitals. Bilateral breast examination showed a palpable, nontender mass with mild redness of the overlying skin with no nipple discharge. Sepsis screen was negative. What is the most appropriate next step in management? Milking of the enlarged breast Surgical intervention Hormonal estimation in neonate Re-assure parents and observe. Answer: D-Re-assure parents and observe. Neonatal mastauxe[12] is the benign proliferation of glandular tissue of the breast [Figure 2]. The crossing of maternal estrogen across the placenta into the fetal circulation or a normal response to dropping estrogen levels in the maternal circulation towards the end of pregnancy, which may trigger the secretion of prolactin from the neonate’s pituitary gland, is considered the etiological factor. It is asymptomatic or physiological in 60%–90% of cases and can be unilateral or bilateral, more frequently bilateral. It usually presents in the 1st week of life and resolves spontaneously within 6 months of age but may take longer in some babies. Less often, there can be some liquid secretion from an enlarged breast, called the witch’s milk, which may disappear with time without treatment. This nipple discharge can be bloody at times due to mammary duct ectasia. Management mainly involves simple observation and reassurance to the parents as the breast tissue involutes and resolves by its own.[7] As it is a self-limiting condition, hormonal estimation or surgical estimation is usually not done. Milking of the breast can lead to further worsening and hence to be avoided.Figure 2: Courtesy: Department of Pediatrics, KIMS, KIIT, DU8. In C-reactive protein (CRP), the C stands for: Canavallin A Cellular Chondoitin Sulfate C polysaccharide of Streptococcus. Answer: D–C polysaccharide of Streptococcus. Explanation CRP is an acute protein released in the early phase of inflammation against a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. CRP binds to phosphocholine expressed on capsular polysaccharide (C-polysaccharide) from Streptococcus pneumoniae. It activates the complement system and increases the release of interleukin-6 and cytokines.[8] 9. A 2-day-old term appropriate for gestational age baby presented with severe respiratory distress and cyanosis. On examination, SpO2 is 60%–70% with wide split S2 and chest X-ray as shown. What is the most probable diagnosis? Obstructed Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Large atrial septal defect (ASD). Answer: A–Obstructed TAPVC. Explanation Obstructed TAPVC is a surgical emergency that presents in the early neonatal period with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac output. Prostaglandin E1 is typically contraindicated in this critical congenital heart defect and immediate surgical repair is needed.[9] VSD and ASD are acyanotic heart diseases which are usually present at 4–6 weeks of life. TOF is a cyanotic congenital heart disease which usually presents in late infancy and has oligemic lung fields in chest X-ray. 10. A newborn term male infant is found to have bruising and petechiae on his limbs on the 4th day of life. He is not dysmorphic and his liver and spleen are not enlarged. The newborn infant is well. His complete blood count shows a hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL, total WBC of 8000/mm3 and platelet count of 5000/mm3. A blood smear confirms a very low platelet count and is otherwise normal. His mother had a history of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that required splenectomy when she was a teenager. Her platelet count is 250,000/mm3. What is the likely diagnosis in this case? Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Kasabach–Merritt syndrome. Answer: A–Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Infants of mothers with ITP who have been splenectomized may have transient neonatal ITP even though the maternal count is normal. This reflects the passage of circulating platelet autoantibodies from the mother to the infant during pregnancy. The platelet count in such infants is often at its lowest level a few days following birth. Infants with neonatal ITP generally respond well to high-dose immunoglobulin-G therapy with or without concomitant corticosteroids. The response to random donor platelets in such a case would likely be poor, and exchange transfusions to remove platelet autoantibodies are an invasive procedure in the newborn.[10] In neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, there is no maternal history of thrombocytopenia. Kasabach–Merritt syndrome is a rare but life-threatening coagulopathy of infancy which presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of a rapidly enlarging vascular tumor. In DIC, the baby is very sick with uncontrolled bleeding, simultaneous with uncontrolled clotting, set into motion by an inappropriate activation, and consumption of clotting factors resulting in a hemorrhagic state due to inadequate hemostasis.

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

It is proposed that patients with anorexia nervosa (SEED-AN) or bulimia nervosa (SEED-BN) that requires the regular attention of a multidisciplinary team and is of a duration known to have a low recovery rate should be included in the SEED group. These patients present with a combination of severe symptoms and long-term illness, and may experience serious chronic physical sequelae (e.g. osteoporosis and renal failure), marked social isolation and stigma. Their carers suffer from the stress of caring for them over a prolonged period. Symptoms, treatment and crisis management of SEED-AN are discussed. SEED is a relatively recently described area of eating disorders psychiatry that requires research and service development so that patients and carers are helped to cope with very serious chronic, but not incurable, conditions.

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

      "title": "“Infantile Colic” as the Sole Manifestation of Gastroesophageal Reflux",
      "abstract": "“Infantile colic” is a colloquial term that is used to designate frequent prolonged bouts of fussing, crying, restlessness, and increased motor activity for no apparent reason, in an otherwise healthy infant (1). Tradition has it that “infantile colic” tends to improve and disappear after 3-4 months of age, but in reality the condition is also noted to persist well into the second half of the 1 st year of life (2). A variety of conditions have been proposed to cause the clinical array that is labeled “infantile colic,” among them intrafamilial problems (3), malabsorption of sugar(s) (4), cow's milk protein allergy (5), neuroendocrine factors (6), depending on the specific viewpoint from which the condition is studied, and the modes of treatment vary accordingly. Bouts of crying, irritability, and restlessness can also be manifested by infants who have pathological gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (7). From accruing experience with lower esophageal pH monitoring, it has emerged that pathological GER can exist without overt evidence of regurgitation, vomiting, or respiratory disturbances (“silent” reflux), while still causing esophagitis (8), and evoking episodes of bitter crying and restlessness that may be construed as reflecting “infantile colic.” In effect, in the course of our experience with esophageal pH monitoring, we detected significant GER in infants whose sole clinical manifestations were episodes of fussing, crying, and restlessness, which had been diagnosed by the primary physician as “infantile colic.” We therefore undertook to perform esophageal pH studies in a prospective series of babies with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” that was severe and persistent enough to induce referral to our Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-six consecutive babies, ages 2-9 months, had been labeled as having “infantile colic,” which featured daily prolonged episodes of bitter crying, with irritability, restlessness, and increased motor activity that included drawing up of the legs and stamping movements. The events went on for more than 4 weeks, and had not responded to parental reassurance, dietary manipulations, defoaming agents and herbal teas. There had been no deviation from normal health and development, and no apparent source for the distress. After a detailed history and physical examination, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was performed with a pH-sensitive electrode placed 4 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter and connected to a Digitrapper MK III recording and digitizing device (Synectics AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The test was performed and interpreted in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (9). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents. Infants whose pH-metry indicated significant GER (9), primarily by a finding of esophageal pH < 4 for longer than the upper percentile value for age (9), received oral treatment with cisapride (0.2 mg/kg, q.i.d.) and cimetidine (10 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Cisapride was given throughout the 3 months of follow-up and beyond, whereas cimetidine was discontinued after 4 weeks. The infants with GER were followed up during a period of 3 months, by daily event-reports handed in by the parents every 10 days, and a monthly evaluation of the infants during a visit at the outpatient clinic. RESULTS Of the 26 infants, 14 were male and 12 were female. Their ages ranged between 2 and 9 months (median 4.8 months), and the age at onset of the symptoms was 3 weeks to 4 months (median 1.8 months). The time from onset of symptoms to performance of pH-metry ranged between 5 weeks and 6 months, and had been longer than 2 months in 21 of the infants. Pathological GER was detected by pH-metry in 16 of the 26 infants (61.5%) (Table 1). Treatment with cisapride and cimetidine of these 16 infants, who were referred with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” but were found to have pathological GER, induced a reduction in the frequency and in the severity of the events within 5 days in 12 of the infants, whereas after 14 days of treatment all the infants with GER were free of any symptom that could be regarded as a manifestation of “infantile colic.” In the remaining 10 infants, those who did not have GER on pH-metry, the picture of “infantile colic” gradually resolved over a period of 4-6 weeks, throughout which family-intervention measures were continued. DISCUSSION The pattern of the clinical constellation that is termed “infantile colic” tends to be fairly stereotypic, in spite of the diversity of conditions that have been proposed as causative agents. A specific cause cannot be discerned in most instances of genuine(?) “infantile colic.” The initial therapeutic measures that the primary physician will undertake are largely influenced by the contention that overproduction of gas by malabsorbed sugars (4) and food allergies (5) are major causes of “infantile colic,” and will most often consist of parental reassurance and dietary manipulation, perhaps with the addition of a defoaming agent such as simethicone, which has been shown to be no more effective than placebo (10). Our study indicates that the differential diagnosis of “infantile colic” should include GER, which can manifest solely as bouts of crying and restlessness, in the absence of any of the other clinical features that are traditionally associated with GER. In our series of 26 infants, who were studied by esophageal pH monitoring while they were having only attacks of crying and restlessness that were labeled “infantile colic,” 16 (61%) were found to have significant GER. The administration of medications that are recommended for the management of GER disease, namely, H2 block-age (cimetidine) and a prokinetic drug (cisapride) (11), induced a dramatic improvement and disappearance of the “colic” features within 5-14 days. GER that causes symptoms is pathological, and requires appropriate therapy that will allay the symptoms, reduce reflux, heal the esophagitis, and prevent long-term complications (11). We are aware that our series consists of selected patients whose seemed to be refractory to the usual therapies, and that our observations are not based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We are also aware that “infantile colic” may resolve spontaneously with time. However, we may regard our group of infants with GER as being their own controls, inasmuch as the rapidity of resolution of their “infantile colic” following initiation of anti-reflux therapy is strongly suggestive of a putative role for GER in evoking the repeated episodes of inconsolable crying and restlessness. We conclude from our observations, that GER can fully mimic the clinical array termed “infantile colic.” Awareness of this association is warranted in view of the damaging potential of pathological GER that is left untreated (8). It might even be justified to propose that severe “infantile colic” be managed by addressing the possibility of GER, whereas other modes of treatment become warranted if no improvement is apparent after 10 days of antireflux medication.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder that describes repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to increased work of breathing, blood gas derangements, intrathoracic pressure swings, autonomic imbalances, and fragmented sleep.Even though the body is undergoing many physiologic disturbances (measured in exquisite detail over many hours), we continue to define the disease by one metric-the apneahypopnea index, or AHI.The AHI quantifies the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, regardless of associated hypoxemia, hypercarbia, arousals, hemodynamic changes, etc.An AHI ≥ 5 events/h diagnoses OSA, and an AHI ≥ 30 events/h arguably arbitrarily defines \"severe OSA\".However, as anyone who reads sleep studies appreciates, not all apneas or hypopneas are the same (between individuals or even within an single night; Figure 1).By distilling OSA into this single metric, we disregard other potentially impactful disease characteristics, such as event duration, hypoxemia burden, arousal intensity, heart rate variability, sleep stage, or body position dependence.][5] Several studies have attempted to identify polysomnographic traits that may better predict cardiovascular disease.For example, Oldenburg et al 6 showed the amount of total sleep time with SpO 2 < 90% (TST90) better predicted all-cause mortality in OSA patients with heart failure even after adjustment for confounding factors.In their study, the risk of death increased by 16% for every hour of TST90.Azarbarzin et al 7 computed a measurement of \"hypoxic burden\" by measuring the area under the oxygen desaturation curve during an obstructive event.They found that hypoxic burden from OSA was better than AHI at predicting cardiovascular endpoints.Butler et al 8 found that shorter duration of obstructive events predicted allcause mortality over and beyond that predicted by the AHI.Event duration is a heritable trait reflecting arousability.Those who tend to have shorter obstructive events may be prone to greater sleep fragmentation and sympathetic activity, which are detrimental to cardiovascular health.Finally, data is amassing to suggest that the pathogenesis and sequelae of OSA are sleep-stage dependent.Obstructive events during",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is essential for the growth and maturation of many target tissues, including the brain and skeleton. As a result, abnormalities of thyroid gland function in infancy and childhood result not only in the metabolic consequences of thyroid dysfunction seen in adult patients, but in unique effects on the growth and /or maturation of these thyroid hormone-dependent tissues as well. In most instances, there are critical windows of time for thyroid hormone-dependent development and so the specific clinical consequence of thyroid dysfunction depends on the age of the infant or child. For example, newborn infants with congenital hypothyroidism frequently have hyperbilirubinemia, and delayed skeletal maturation, reflecting immaturity of liver and bone, respectively, and they are at risk of permanent mental retardation if thyroid hormone therapy is delayed or inadequate; their size at birth, however, is normal. In contrast, hypothyroidism that develops after the age of three years (when most thyroid hormone-dependent brain development is complete) is characterized predominantly by a deceleration in linear growth and skeletal maturation but there is no permanent effect on cognitive development. In general, infants with severe defects in thyroid gland development or inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis present in infancy whereas babies with less severe defects or acquired abnormalities, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, present later in childhood and adolescence. In the newborn infant , thyroid function is influenced not only by the neonate ’ s own thyroid gland but by the transplacental passage from the mother of factors that affect the fetal thyroid gland.",

Patients suffer multiple comorbid medical and psychiatric problems; moreover, deficits in treatment motivation are commonly seen, which causes a high rate of dropout from treatment programs. Thus, recent studies have focused on the etiology in order to develop efficient treatment options, as this can become a life-threatening problem. Prevention programs are also gaining attention, since full recovery can take a significant time and resources nevertheless may not be available for all cases. In this chapter, a brief history and basic diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa will be summarized. A review of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions will be addressed. Prominent theories regarding its etiology and treatment options will be discussed in terms of a biopsychosocial approach. Finally, prevention studies will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

      "abstract": "Generalized periodic patterns with triphasic wave morphology, long referred to as triphasic waves [TWs], had been associated with metabolic encephalopathies, although other neurologic and systemic causes have since been identified. In a recent classification of periodic patterns, TWs were formally grouped with the generalized periodic discharges, which are often associated with ictal activity. The interpretation of generalized periodic patterns with TWs as nonictal can have significant implications in the management of comatose patients in nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Electrographic characteristics that help distinguish nonictal periodic patterns with TWs from generalized periodic discharge ictal patterns include (1) TWs in long runs of periodic bilaterally synchronous and symmetric discharges, maximal in frontocentral or posterior head regions with and without a frontal-to-occipital lag or posterior-to-anterior lag, respectively; (2) recurrent spontaneous and/or low-dose benzodiazepine-induced attenuation and/or suppression of the periodic pattern and replacement with a diffuse slow wave activity throughout a prolonged EEG recording; and (3) stimulation-induced activation and/or increase in frequency and/or organization of TWs. We coined the term of status triphasicus to describe the electrographic periodic pattern of TWs with these three distinct characteristics. In this article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of keeping the status triphasicus pattern as a distinct electrographic entity different from periodic ictal generalized periodic discharge patterns. We discuss the circumstances in which a status triphasicus pattern can be associated with ictal activity and propose a simple pragmatic classification of status triphasicus that encompasses the different clinical scenarios it can be associated with.",

      "title": "The LSD syndrome. A review.",
      "abstract": "lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful bio-active substance related to serotonin in structure. Its actions generally affect autonomic, sensory and psychological functions. Autonomic stimulation is varied. Sensory responses are usually visual, involving heightened and distorted color perception and fusion of sensory impressions. Psychological responses include a feeling that a unique experience is occurring; feelings of depersonalization; pronounced fluctuation of mood; time and space distortions; autistic phenomena; fluctuation of aggressive drives (usually reduction); and spontaneous reoccurrence of the lsd experience. THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES CAN BE RELATED TO THREE BASIC PHENOMENA: (1) expectation; (2) loss of characteristic modes of perceptual and cognitive patterning; and (3) hypersuggestibility. THE MAJOR ADVERSE REACTIONS ARE: (1) chronic drug dependence including subsequent personality changes and depressive reactions; and (2) acute ego dissolution. These reactions usually occur in already emotionally ill people. Most of these users fall into two groups, those with unresolved identity problems and those with severe ego abnormality. The majority of adverse reactions are of the chronic drug dependence type and are usually seen in adolescents and young adults who have not negotiated the age-appropriate tasks of forming and integrating the various identities that are the composite of their life experiences.lsd helps alleviate these stresses via some of its psychological properties as discussed. It also provides a nidus for the formation of a subculture where goals for social, sexual and vocational achievement are lower and idiosyncratic modes of adaptation are better tolerated. A smaller group of users who have serious reactions such as psychosis, rage reactions, homicidal and suicidal ideation are usually found to have preexisting ego abnormality such as ambulatory schizophrenia, chronic impulse disorders and borderline states. Although adverse reactions most often appear to be related to pre-morbid psychopathology, this is not invariably so. Further, there is as yet no reliable method to determine who will have an adverse reaction and what the nature of that reaction will be.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

For similar reasons, the suicidal behavior was not included in the depression table. It is possible that the admixture of suicidal ideation with the manic episode (if not literary license) represented a mixed affective condition, since the author does report marked mood swings (eg, \"My happiness and sadness was all out of proportion to anything that was happending.\"<sup>1(p108)</sup>).",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by deterioration of cognition, memory and physical functions. Social isolation (SI) or insufficient contact with others can exacerbate memory deficits. Malnutrition and weight loss are frequent complications of AD. Protein malnutrition (PM) was reported to predict rapid cognitive decline and progression of AD. Physical and mental activities (Ph&M) influence the rate and prevalence of cognitive decline and may protect against dementia; their role especially in the presence of AD risk factors is still under investigation. Two major groups of rats each of 8 subgroups were used and treated for either 4 or 5 weeks as following: 2 groups received saline either alone or with Ph&M; 2 groups subjected to both SI&PM (10% casein) either alone or with Ph&M and 4 AD groups received every day 70mg/kg of ALCl3,IP; one group served as AD model while the other 3 groups were subjected to Ph&M, SI&PM or both of them. Swimming and forced swimming tests were performed each for one time/week during the 4 or 5 weeks of the experiment for maintaining Ph&M. Histopathological changes in different brain regions as well as biochemical changes in Aβ, Tau, β-secretase, ACHE, monoamins (DA, NE, 5-HT), inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β), oxidative parameters (MDA, SOD, TAC), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and DNA fragmentation were measured for all groups. Brain neurological damage characterizing AD or PM associated with SI was more pronounced when AD is associated with PM&SI in rats and the severity increased by time. By maintaining Ph&M; Aβ, β-secretase, Tau, ACHE, MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and DNA fragmentation were significantly decreased while SOD, TAC, DA, NE, 5-HT and BDNF were increased. The protective effect of Ph&M against brain neuronal damage was clearer by time especially when AD is associated with PM&SI. These results were confirmed by the histopathological examinations. Maintaining Ph&M can protect from brain neuronal degenerations induced by AD especially when associated with the risk of PM&SI. The protection was more marked in AD associated risk factors especially during the disease progression.",

Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46‐year‐old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5 mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37 °C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm 3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm 3 . Serum sodium was 134 mmol/l, potassium 6.4 mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3 mmol/l, urea 30 mmol/l, creatinine 998 μmol/l, glucose 5.16 mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4 mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen‐associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was &gt;600 ng/ml (therapeutic range 80–400 ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (&lt;200 ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4‐h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72 h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low‐dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

It is present in a large proportion of patients in their 20s but also in their 30s and 40s.

A less consistent picture suggesting affective instability and impulsivity has emerged from the assessment of subjects with bulimia nervosa. Considerable heterogeneity exists within eating disorder subtypes, however, and a number of special problems complicate the interpretation of personality data in this population. These include young age at onset, the influence of state variables such as depression and starvation sequelae, denial and distortion in self-report, the instability of subtype diagnoses, and the persistence of residual problems following symptom control.",

Most individuals have bowel movements at regular intervals, and although the frequency varies from person to person, stools should pass without significant straining or discomfort. Functional constipation is often described as difficult or infrequent bowel movements/ deviation from normal frequency, painful defecation, the passage of hard stools, and/or sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool.

      "abstract": "While gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation due to organic causes can be identified by various investigations, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), on the other hand, are multi-symptomatic conditions that have no underlying mucosal or structural abnormalities. They are diagnosed based on a collection of symptom complexes. Functional Gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are quite common in children. The exact cause remains unknown; however, it has usually been referred to as multifactorial. Noninfectious causes affecting the gastrointestinal tract early in life, such as cow’s milk allergy (CMA), can predispose to the development of FGID later in childhood. There are three common concepts for FGID: (1) no known structural cause, (2) no symptoms due to stress disorders, or (3) due to a motility disorder. Although FGID have a great impact on patient morbidity and time off work, some physicians deny or belittle their existence, while other physicians exhibit negative attitude toward such patients. Over the past 2 decades, researchers have started to unravel the underlying mechanisms behind these conditions. For example, impaired gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion, along with enhanced visceral sensitivity, have been shown to be key abnormalities associated with the characteristic symptoms of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits as experienced by patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Gastrointestinal motility disorders that are due to altered physiological factors lead to altered physiological function. In recent years, these factors stem from the brain-gut axis interaction and dysfunction. Gastrointestinal motility can be measured and abnormal patterns can be identified using tests for different part of the gastrointestinal tract which provide information to help with diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial factors, through the brain-gut axis, affect the physiologic function of the gut, which in turn alters motility and sensation, modulating inflammation, which may be caused by or associated with altered bacterial flora.",

Onset occurs before the age of 18 months and in some cases there are neonatal symptoms such as abnormal eye movements, especially nystagmus, and dystonic or tonic seizures. Attacks of hemiplegia, which disappear during sleep, begin before the age of one year. These symptoms can initially be taken for an epileptic disorder.We describe the study of two male patients whose clinical symptoms appeared at the age of 6 months, with tonic seizures, upward deviation of gaze, without loss of consciousness, which occurred with a recurrence rate of between one and two attacks a week or several times a day. They were initially treated with antiepileptic drugs (AED), although the complementary tests, including electroencephalogram (EEG), computerised axial tomography (TAC), magnetic resonance (MR) scans and metabolic tests, were all normal.Since, to date, no specific test has been confirmed for the disease, diagnosis is essentially clinical and by exclusion. Treatment is symptomatic using flunarizine. In one of our cases, administration of a single 10 mg/day dose this drug at night lowered the frequency of the attacks of hemiplegia. The possibility of treating a patient who is a carrier of an AH with AED makes early knowledge and identification of this disease necessary in order to be able to improve the patient's prognosis.",

      "title": "The possible association between COVID-19 and postural tachycardia syndrome",
      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves other body organs besides the lungs. In recovered patients, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 may include dysautonomia, in which changes in functioning of ≥1 components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) adversely affect health. This viewpoint focuses on the dysautonomia postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS is characterized by a sustained heart rate increment of ≥30 beats/min within 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt. Cardiologic symptoms include chest pain, palpitations, exercise intolerance, and orthostatic intolerance. Other symptoms may include fatigue, \"brain fog,\" gastrointestinal issues (e.g., abdominal pain, bloating, gastroparesis, and nausea), chronic pain (e.g., headache, temperomandibular joint disorder, and fibromyalgia), and sleep abnormalities. Comorbidities include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, sensory neuropathy, or autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus and Sjogren syndrome). These aspects extend beyond cardiology. Both post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and POTS manifest as multi-system, multi-disciplinary syndromes. Thinking in terms of the \"extended ANS\" (EAS) may help comprehend how these syndromes come about and how to test for and treat them.1Goldstein D.S. The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar The ANS has been defined by 3 components: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and the enteric nervous system. The EAS expands the meaning of \"autonomic\" in 2 ways, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune. Cannon taught that activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland in emergencies helps maintain homeostasis, a word he invented. Since then, other neuroendocrine systems have been described that are closely linked to components of the ANS. These include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), and the arginine vasopressin system. Across a variety of stressors, responses of plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels are more closely tied to those of adrenocorticotropin (the anterior pituitary hormone of the HPA axis) than of norepinephrine (NE, the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic noradrenergic system (SNS)). These findings support a close association between the sympathetic adrenergic system (SAS) and the HPA axis. The SNS and SAS in turn are closely connected to the RAS. Occupation of β1 adrenoceptors in renal juxtaglomerular cells releases renin, adrenomedullary chromaffin cells possess angiotensin receptors that when occupied evoke EPI secretion, and there is a central neural renin-angiotensin system that participates in the regulation of sympathetic outflow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 converts angiotensin II (AII) to angiotensin 1–7, which opposes the effects of AII. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2. In addition to being a pressor and the body's main water-retaining hormone, in the brain vasopressin augments baroreflexive restraint of sympathetic outflows. A second aspect of the EAS is neuroimmunity. Cortisol is well known to be the major anti-inflammatory compound of the HPA axis. The cytokine interleukin 6 activates the HPA axis2Path G. Bornstein S.R. Ehrhart-Bornstein M. Scherbaum W.A.

A cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway involves cytokine-induced increases in vagal afferent traffic and vagal efferent inhibitory effects on inflammasomal cytokine release.3Tracey K.J.

The central autonomic network: functional organization, dysfunction, and perspective.Mayo Clin Proc. 1993; 68: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar The central autonomic network is the source of outflows to ANS components including the SNS, SAS, and PNS. When the central stress system is activated, PNS outflows generally decrease, which would be expected to promote tachycardia. Other manifestations of PNS inhibition include decreased gastrointestinal motility, decreased salivation and lacrimation, and decreased urinary bladder tone. Acute COVID-19 is associated with several central nervous system abnormalities including stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, anosmia, anorexia, headache, nausea, and delirium. A meta-analysis of the literature from previous epidemics (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome) noted high frequencies of confusion, depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory, and insomnia.6Rogers J.P.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management.J Intern Med. 2019; 285: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar There are several pathophysiological mechanisms that might be associated with post-COVID POTS. They are not mutually exclusive, and to date there is no published evidence supporting any of them. One mechanism is hypovolemia. Fever, anorexia, nausea, excessive nocturnal sweating, and prolonged bed rest might operate together to decrease blood volume and secondarily increase cardiac SNS outflow. In POTS, deconditioning can be part of a vicious cycle involving low stroke volume, high SNS or SAS outflows, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These findings have been called \"Grinch heart.\"8Fu Q. Vangundy T.B. Galbreath M.M. et al.Cardiac origins of the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.J Am Coll Cardiol. 2010; 55: 2858-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar Second, SARS-CoV-2 might infect and destroy extracardiac postganglionic SNS neurons, secondarily increasing cardiac SNS outflow in a manner analogous to neuropathic POTS. This might include splanchnic venous pooling or a failure of reflexive mesenteric vasoconstriction during orthostasis. Third, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the brainstem and alter functions of medullary centers, resulting in increased central sympathetic outflows in a manner analogous to takotsubo cardiopathy.9Akashi Y.J. Goldstein D.S. Barbaro G. Ueyama T. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a new form of acute, reversible heart failure.Circulation. 2008; 118: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar Centrally mediated increases in sympathetic noradrenergic and SAS outflows as part of stress system activation might be associated with psychiatric morbidity such as anxiety or depression. There could be alterations in brain perfusion manifesting with \"brain fog.\" Fourth is autoimmunity. In response to a viral infection, immune responses targeting the virus are regulated in a complex, dynamic way, balancing attacking the virus vs attacking the host's own cells. There is substantial literature describing autoimmune markers and autoantibodies in POTS; however, there is insufficient evidence of pathogenicity. Considering the survival advantage of molecular mimicry by a virus and the novelty of COVID-19, POTS could result from disruption of this delicate balance—\"dyshomeostasis.\"1Goldstein D.S. The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar The first reported patient with COVID-associated POTS10Miglis M.G. Prieto T. Shaik R. Muppidi S. Sinn D.I. Jaradeh S. A case report of postural tachycardia syndrome after COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar awoke with palpitations and shortness of breath on day 7 of her acute illness. On day 22 she noted hyperactivity, pressured speech, and a feeling of inner restlessness and on day 24 episodic \"adrenaline surges\" characterized by diarrhea, tremors, and worsening restlessness. On day 45 she had episodic facial flushing, dermatographia, and nonpruritic hives. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent formal ANS evaluation. The testing confirmed excessive orthostatic tachycardia, normal or even exaggerated increases in blood pressure in late Phase II and Phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver, and large pressure oscillations without hyperventilation during 10 minutes of head-up tilting. Plasma NE with the patient supine was normal at 379 pg/mL and was 310 pg/mL when she was upright (time upright not reported). The workup was insufficient to identify hypovolemia, sympathetic noradrenergic neuropathy, increased SAS outflow, or autoimmunity as pathophysiological mechanisms. Autonomic function testing that applies the EAS concept would include evaluations not only of Langley's ANS but also of the neuroendocrine component (SAS, HPA axis, RAS, and vasopressin) and the neuroimmune component (both humoral and cellular).

COVID-19 does not only disturb our social rhythmHeart RhythmVol. 18Issue 4PreviewWith 10 vaccines currently approved and another 81 potentially to be approved in the coming months, the focus on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed from confinement to elimination. However, it is a known viral law that when the going gets tough, the tough get going, with natural selection bringing forth the most favorable mutations. Among these, the most worrying were found in South Africa, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, of which the latter initially has been designated as a \"variant of concern.\" Early research shows that mutations in these variants might (partly) escape the immune response.

Sleepiness is experienced as a subjective difficulty maintaining alertness accompanied by a rapid entrance into sleep when the person is sedentary. Often this leads to decrements in quality-of-life, cognitive impairment, and increased accidents (2,3). Each year in the United States greater than 50,000motor vehicle accidents are attributed to driving while drowsy (4). Sleepiness has many causes including insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, medical and neurological illness, and medication side effects. This chapter focuses on sleep disorders where excessive sleepiness is the primary symptom; this includes narcolepsy (sporadic and secondary), idiopathic hypersomnia, hypersomnia due to medical conditions (posttraumatic hypersomnia), recurrent hypersomnia, and behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness.

The International Continence Society (ICS) published a new standardization of terminology of lower urinary tract function in 2002. Storage symptoms include increased daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency and incontinence. Of incontinence, stress, urge and mixed incontinence are the major symptoms, and ICS has also defined enuresis, continuous incontinence and giggle incontinence as other types of incontinence. Urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, can be described as overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, urge syndrome, or urgency/frequency syndrome. These syndromes suggest urodynamically demon- strable detrusor overactivity, but may be due to other forms of urethro-vesical dysfunction. Overactive bladder is an empirical diagnosis used as the basis for initial management after assessing lower urinary tract symptoms, physical findings urinalysis, and other indicated evaluation. Voiding symptoms include slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining and terminal dribble. micturition symptoms include a of incomplete and post micturition dribble. The feeling of incomplete emptying symptom was formerly categorized as either a storage symptom or a voiding symptom, but has been categorized among the post micturition symptoms in the new ICS terminology. Post micturition dribble is the term used when an individual describes the involuntary loss of urine immediately after he/she has finished passing urine, usually in men after leaving the toilet. Thus this symptom is not incontinence, and is categorized among the post micturition symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder commonly encountered after hemisphere stroke, most often in the right hemisphere. Neglect patients fail to attend and respond to stimuli presented on the side of space opposite to the brain lesion. Neglect implies a complex dysfunction in the co-action between perception, motor behavior and the environment where the patients attentive capacities and the environmental space are of special importance. Patients difficulties can be seen in that they do not eat from the left side of the plate or omit words to the left when asked to read. Commonly patients do not have a complete insight into their neglect problems. Neglect in stroke patients has been associated with poor outcome on functional activities. Signs of neglect are not always obvious but can be explored and assessed quickly by bedside neuropsychological testing. Neglect is often more unclear to an observer than, e.g. if a patient suffers from paresis or aphasia. Education for patients, their relatives and others are therefore important.",

      "abstract": "In legal practice it is assumed that the ordinary man intends the natural consequences of his acts. When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

Peripheral neuropathy is manifested as pain in the extremities, and it may progress to a severe motor neuropathy. Measurement of por‐phobilinogen in the urine gives a prompt diagnosis during acute attacks. Attacks are often induced by precipitating factors such as drugs, alcohol, infection, fasting or changes in sex‐hormone balance, and they should be eliminated when a patient is treated during an attack. Heme, the end biosynthetic product, is the most effective therapy for restoration of porphyrin biosynthesis to normal, and it is usually infused at 3mg/kg daily for 4 days. Adequate calories are necessary and parenteral nutrition with carbohydrates may be necessary. Attacks may also require therapy for hypertension, pain and epileptic seizures. Strict avoidance of all precipitating factors may not be necessary in the asymptomatic phase.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

This paper reviews current literature, considering its physical effects, its prevalence, and problems in its definition, diagnosis, and measurement. Models of its causation and current treatment strategies are reviewed. It appears that there is a need for further systematic research in the area. There is considerable disagreement regarding what bulimia nervosa is, how prevalent it is, how it should be assessed, what causes it, and how best to treat it. Whether bulimia is a single problem or a common behavioural outcome of a number of problems is also unclear. Directions for further research which might clarify these basic disagreements are suggested.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee.

      "abstract": "This paper reviews two learning theory-based models of experiential contributions to depression: response contingent positive reinforcement and learned helplessness. The authors argue that these models connect to a phenomenon that may explain why symptoms of behavioral excess (e.g. rumination) often occur in depression that is otherwise marked by symptoms of behavioral deficit (e.g. anhedonia). Specifically, the authors illustrate that that concept of schedule strain (or low rates of response contingent reinforcement giving rise to low frequencies of behavior) unites these models. Depression is more likely, or more severe, when schedule strain conditions occur in situations containing reinforcers important to the individual and/or when they simultaneously occur in a number of situations. Conditions of schedule strain are known to give rise to adjunctive behaviors: apparently irrelevant, easy behaviors that deliver immediate reinforcement. This paper suggests that, for some depressed individuals, behavioral excess symptoms like rumination and overeating might serve adjunctive functions. Implications of this hypothesis are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is abnormal, persistent pain that is caused by injury to the somatosensory system. It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia.

      "abstract": "We report a case of 26 years old gentleman diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder who developed mania after one week of initiation of quetiapine at 200mg/d. Induction of mania in our patient is keeping with the literature regarding induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at a lower dose of quetiapine. Hypomanic or manic symptoms at a low dose of quetiapine are brief and seem to reverse the effect by either discontinuing the causing agent or increasing it dose. Quetiapine being an atypical antipsychotic possess antidepressant property at low doses as well as mood stabilizer at higher doses. At lower dose, due to its serotonergic antagonism property, quetiapine appears to induce or worsen hypomanic or manic symptoms. As the dosage increases its dopamine antagonistic activity become more prominent and the medication acts as a mood stabilizer. This is one of the possible explanations of disappearing of manic or hypomanic symptoms at a higher dose.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

Obesity can be “catalogued” into four phenotypes: hungry brain (abnormal satiety for alteration of gut–brain axis), emotional hunger (hedonic eating), hungry gut (abnormal duration of satiety for faster gastric emptying) and slow burning (slowing of the metabolic rate). Phenotypes are grafted onto this complexity, the recognition of which allows for personalized medicine and increasingly targeted therapies. Although there are no standardized treatment protocols, we present management options consisting of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies. Nutritional advice and encouragement of adequate physical activity lead to increased self-efficacy and promote a sense of well-being when coupled with psychological approaches involving mindful eating.

La prise en charge therapeutique repose sur une restriction energetique, une augmentation de l’activite physique et un soutien psychologique. La stabilisation de l’exces ponderal, ou sa simple reduction sans que l’indice poids/taille 2 ne diminue, doivent etre considerees comme de veritables succes therapeutiques.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that are challenging to address; however, the primary care setting provides an important opportunity for critical medical and psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., includes updated diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (e.g., elimination of amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion) and for bulimia nervosa (e.g., criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an average of once per week). In addition to the role of environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical signals contribute to the development of eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte abnormalities requires prompt intervention. Family-based treatment is helpful for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, whereas short-term psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy, is effective for most patients with bulimia nervosa. The use of psychotropic medications is limited for anorexia nervosa, whereas treatment studies have shown a benefit of antidepressant medications for patients with bulimia nervosa. Treatment is most effective when it includes a multidisciplinary, teambased approach.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "abstract": "Background : Abnormal eye movements can occur in patients with neurological diseases. These have been described in unconscious patients due to anoxic coma and often disappear as the patient regains consciousness. Ocular dipping movements are rarely seen in practice in pediatric patients. Methods : A one year old male patient was brought unconscious with electrocution injury. With resuscitation, he became hemodynamically stable. He could not recognize his mother or respond to visual/auditory stimuli; and had generalized hypertonia. Cranial nerves were normal. He showed abnormal involuntary conjugate vertical saccadic eye movements, consisting of slow downward movement (for 1-2 seconds) followed by a relatively faster return to the primary mid-position. These persisted continuously for 48 hours at irregular intervals of 1-2 seconds. The patient was awake but non-responsive and not interested in surroundings. Results : These eye movements are called ocular dipping (OD) . In a normal person, saccadic movements are meant for stable fixation and are maintained by pause-cell neurons positioned in the pontine raphe. These prevent the occurrence of unwanted saccadic pulses by inhibiting the saccadic premotor burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation and midbrain. Injury to pause cells leads to extraneous saccades without fixation. It appears that cortical and basal ganglia malfunction causes ocular dipping. OD is mainly seen in anoxic coma and creuztfelt Jacob disease. A 53-year-old man developed ocular dipping following prolonged hypotension.Our patient was in vegetative state with normal respiratory and cardiac function suggesting that major midbrain and medullary centers were intact. Conclusion : The self limiting nature of OD suggests that these are caused by diffuse dysfunction rather than a single structural locus.",

      "title": "Depression and Pain",
      "abstract": "Dartmouth Medical School, Dartmouth College, Lebanon, New Hampshire. edgar.a.romero-sandoval@dartmouth.eduA LARGE population of patients concomitantly experiences chronic pain and depression or symptoms of depression (52% in pain clinics, or 85% in chronic facial pain dental clinics, for example).1How these two syndromes coexist, interact, reinforce each other, and/or are maintained is poorly understood. It is not known whether pain itself can directly cause depression; if so, whether depression or its symptoms start concurrently with pain or develop while pain is perpetuated is not clear. Is it possible that the treatment of a depressive mood is sufficient to allow patients in chronic pain to return to normal activities and enjoy activities that used to make them happy? In this issue of ANESTHESIOLOGY, Wang et al. describe that acute or chronic pain (rather than stress or inflammation) causes depression-like behaviors in rats.2The authors show through pharmacologic means that the mechanisms by which pain and depression are maintained differ and are partly independent. Ketamine, in doses that did not affect evoked pain-related behaviors (10–20 mg/kg), effectively reduced depression-like behaviors (immobility using the forced swim test, and reduced sucrose preference using the sucrose preference test). Interestingly, ketamine's effects on depression-like behaviors lasted at least 5 days, far outlasting its presence in meaningful concentrations in blood or tissue. In addition, ketamine did not relieve hypersensitivity to tactile stimuli after peripheral nerve injury and yet recovered the rats' normal response to physically react to certain situations and the ability to choose a sweet solution (supposedly pleasurable) over plain water.It seems that, at least in rodents or in the rodent model of chronic pain that the authors used, depression does not contribute to evoked peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-related behaviors. However, in humans depression can exacerbate3or generate pain,4suggesting that the treatment of depression will affect pain in patients. This discrepancy may be due to a difference between our current animal pain models and pain states in humans, or that we measure responses to evoked stimuli in rodents but measure spontaneous pain in patients. It is also possible that other types of rodent chronic pain models correlate better with clinical situations in terms of evoked pain and depression-like behaviors. Likewise, depression is the result of complex processes that are difficult to mimic or determine in rodent models or rodent behaviors. Therefore, the return to normal behavior after ketamine under stress situations may not necessarily reflect a more proper response to such stimuli, or the preference for sucrose solution over water may not necessarily reflect the regain of pleasure for enjoyable activities. Nevertheless, these models are affected by clinically used antidepressants, and Wang et al. observed that these depression-like behaviors in rats were blocked by ketamine, a drug that reduces symptoms of depression in patients.5This finding is indicative of the potential benefits of treating symptoms of depression in patients in pain.This study suggests that depression or symptoms of depression (transient or chronic) are an integral part of the affective or emotional component and a consequence of acute and chronic pain conditions. One wonders to what extent the symptoms of depression contribute to the unpleasantness of pain. Is it possible that patients with chronic pain can improve their quality of life if depression is successfully treated separately? Perhaps effective treatment of depression will allow patients (still in pain) to enjoy their daily life and resume their normal activities, or allow them to perform other activities that enhance the chances to relieve their pain (physiotherapy or exercise). These intriguing conjectures seem less provocative in light of data demonstrating that patients with major depressive disorders have an altered brain processing of pain (increased emotional reactivity in pain anticipation).6Is it possible that under a nondepressed state of mind patients in pain are able to cope better? Perhaps the low efficacy to effectively treat patients with chronic pain7or postoperative pain8will improve if clinicians take the mood of patients in chronic pain more seriously. Should we earnestly consider whether the elimination of a depressive mood has to be a concomitant strategy in the current therapies for pain? In psychiatry the standard of care in managing depression considers that a complete remission of depression is obtained only when all emotional, vegetative, and painful symptoms are treated.4Chronic pain may mask depressive disorders, suggesting that we may have a larger proportion of patients with chronic pain and depressive disorders in our clinics. The benefit of including a comprehensive treatment of depression in patients with chronic pain may have additional implications because depression is one of the most important risk factors for suicide or suicide ideation, and patients with chronic pain have higher rates of suicidal ideation.9,10This study does not rule out the possibility that the effective treatment of pain will result in an improvement of symptoms of depression. Further investigation is warranted. Certainly, in some patients antidepressants reduce both chronic pain and depression. Moreover, even though their maintenance mechanisms can differ, both pain and depression may exacerbate each other in a feedback vicious cycle in some patients, which suggests that the treatment of pain will affect depression. Ketamine seems to act differently from current antidepressants (norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors) because ketamine acts faster as an antidepressant. In addition, ketamine reduces pain. Therefore, one can argue that ketamine may be able to prevent or disrupt more efficiently the interdependence of pain and depression.The study of Wang et al. sheds light on possible improved treatments for chronic pain and sets the foundation to test whether ketamine may play a role in improving the quality of life of this patient population. They have demonstrated that low doses (subanalgesic, which minimized the appearance of undesirable side effects) can produce significant and long-lasting (at least 5 days) effects in depression-like behaviors in rats undergoing nerve injury-induced behavioral hypersensitivity. Ketamine, which may produce enduring antidepressant effects in humans,5has been in clinical use for more than three decades in the United States, and more than 50 yr in Europe. Whether it is safer or more effective than traditional antidepressants for chronic therapy is unknown. Therefore, testing of the Wang et al. hypothesis in patients seems an important next step.",

      "title": "Muscular Fatigue: Considerations for Dance",
      "abstract": "Muscular fatigue can be defined as the failure to maintain an expected power output. It is a multifaceted phenomenon that incorporates metabolic, neural and neuromuscular components, among others. Metabolic causes of fatigue are associated with the ability to maintain energy supply during exercise, the speed at which homeostasis is achieved post-exercise, and the effects of high intensity exercise by-products on the peripheral neuromuscular system. Research has indicated that the central nervous system plays a protective role in preventing catastrophic muscle damage by reducing the intensity and frequency of propagation founded on biofeedback from the muscle cells. The duration and particularly the type of physical activity play a role in the development of muscle fatigue, with impact or weightbearing exercises, such as dance, producing increased symptoms compared to non-impact or non-weightbearing equivalents. The effects of prolonged exercise and the associated increased levels of muscle fatigue that may lead to compromises in neuromuscular propagation need to be considered in dance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disclosure: C.N. Plaza Mejias: None. W. Medina Torres: None. L. Valerio Pérez: None. M. Pérez Mitchell: None. R. Revilla Orellano: None. I. Jiménez Velázquez: None. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a complex endocrine disorder characterized by inadequate hormone production or impaired function, crucial for maintaining physiological equilibrium. Manifestations vary from subtle nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening complications, with diverse causes including autoimmune destruction, infections, and medication-induced suppression. This abstract details a case of a staggered presentation of signs and symptoms of AI with normal laboratory results, making the diagnosis a challenge. The patient, an 80-year-old female patient with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 with neuropathy, and an unspecified neurocognitive disorder, presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain for several days. Patient was admitted for severe hyponatremia after her condition was complicated by altered mental status and a seizure episode requiring administration of 3% NSS. On evaluation, the patient was found awake, alert, and oriented only in person (baseline as per family members), hemodynamically stable, and in no acute distress. Examination was remarkable for dry oral mucosa and poor skin turgor. Normal saline 0.9% was provided to restore volume status. Laboratory work-up revealed decreased serum osmolarity, and elevated urine osmolarity and sodium, suggestive of euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia and raising suspicion for the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). Exclusion of possible etiologies such as traumatic brain injury, surgery, tumors, or medications, narrowed down the source to an infectious process, considering the patient's recent periodontal procedure. Following the elimination of other causes of hyponatremia such as hypothyroidism and thiazide use, the Endocrinology service initiated salt tablets and fluid restriction. Despite initial management, the hyponatremia persisted, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. The absence of hypotension, hyperkalemia, salt craving, skin hyperpigmentation or other classic signs or symptoms, made glucocorticoid deficiency less likely. Cortisol levels and ACTH were relatively within normal range. New onset of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes followed by hypotension prompted reassessment. A trial of steroids led to notable improvement and recurrence of symptoms after discontinuation, pointed towards the diagnosis. DHEAS was obtained, and prednisone therapy was reinitiated. This case highlights the insidious nature of AI and its diagnostic challenges. It emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance particularly when patients present with unexplained and nonspecific symptoms that mimic other medical conditions. In conclusion, a comprehensive approach to differential diagnosis is essential to facilitate diagnostic accuracy and timely intervention to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "title": "Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy — A Maturation Syndrome Coming of Age",
      "abstract": "Myoclonic Seizures: As noted above, myoclonic movements are one of the main symptoms of JME and consist of generalized seizures which are brief, irregular jerks of the head, trunk, and limbs that can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and may involve isolated regions of the body or the whole body.They usually predominate in the upper limbs (mostly distal muscles), although they occasionally involve muscles in the abdomen, paraspinal distributions, and lower extremity [27].It is not uncommon for myoclonic seizures to be so subtle or brief that they are perceived as benign \"inner shocks\".As subtle as the may be, patients tend to more readily notice asymmetric jerks involving the dominant upper extremity because such movements noticeably impair daily functioning.The jerks, if violent, may cause the patient to drop or throw objects, or fall to the floor-which may be mistaken for nonpathological clumsiness.Myoclonic seizures can manifest as discrete, single events or they may occur in clusters.They are usually not associated with loss of consciousness but it is not uncommon for patients to lose awareness during the jerks.Moreover, clusters of myoclonic events can evolve into a GTCS and cause post-ictal confusion.They can occur during transition to sleep or during awakening from sleep, usually in the early morning hours [28].This early morning pattern of seizures is associated with an increase in cortical excitability during that time of day, which has been noted in other patients with GGE, but to a greater extent in JME patients [29].Developmentally, these jerks often subside in the fourth decade of life, although GTCS or absence seizures tend to persist [30].Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures: About 80% of the patients with JME have GTCS.These seizures are also more likely to occur if precipitated by sleep deprivation or alcohol intake.Usually, these events are immediately preceded by a series of myoclonic jerks and associated tongue biting prior to generalization.Because, as noted above, myoclonic events are often insidious, patients first seek treatment following an initial GTCS and are then subsequently diagnosed with JME.Typically, upon further evaluation, such patients acknowledge also that they have experienced myoclonic jerks, a description which adds additional clinical support for a JME diagnosis.Due to this association, some authors have proposed that clinicians should",

      "title": "The Consequences of a Week of Insomnia II: Patients with Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

The three categories of failure to thrive is based on anthropometric measurements of weight, length, and head circumference for age. Type 1 category, inadequate growth or loss of body weight with relatively normal height and head circumference, is the failure to gain weight due mainly to malnutrition. Most of time, the failure to gain weight is detected in a routine visit to the pediatrician. Many parents do not seem to notice the situation until it is brought to their attention. In most instances, the failure to gain weight is insidious and gradual. If malnutrition becomes severe and chronic during the first year of life, the child's neurologic development may be permanently affected, making early recognition and prompt intervention critical. This review may introduce a clinical approach to failure to gain weight in infants visiting out-patients clinic. (Korean J Pediatr 2004;47:355-361)",

      "abstract": "Inborn errors of organic acid metabolism are relatively recently recognized diseases with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms: ranging from asymptomatic, normal appearing children to death during first few days of life.In my presentation I will try to explain some of the most common clinical presentation of these disorder with stress on neurologic findings. Organic acidemia usually have three clinical manifestations Severe neonatal form, Intermittent late-onset form and chronic progressive form. Recurrent coma, The main feature of these disorders is due to accumulation of toxic metabolites in Central Nervous system with direct effect on the function, while chronic accumulation of these materials may interfere with CNS development or cerebral metabolism leading to developmental delay.Severe neonatal formsFollowing a symptom free interval of a few days from birth, poor sucking and difficult feeding appears in the newborn, followed by unexplained and progressive coma. Seizures may appear during the course of the disease and EEG may show a burst-suppression pattern. During this stage most infants have axial hypotonia with peripheral dystonia, choreoathetosis, episodic opisthotonus and some repetitive bicycling and boxing movements.Associated biochemical abnormalities including metabolic acidosis, ketonuria and hyperammonemia also is usually present. The overall short-term prognosis with recent advances in medical care is improving. But later in life acute intercurrent episodes triggered by a stress often occur, which can be occasionally fatal.bulging fontanelle and cerebral edema may mimic CNS infection in these babies.Intermittent late-onset formsRecurrent attacks of coma or lethargy with ataxia can occur in childhood or even in adolescence or adulthood. These episodes may be frequent, though in between these the child is entirely normal. These attacks are precipitated by conditions that enhance protein catabolism (trauma, infection etc).Sometimes these episodes can lead to death or severe sequel. Seizure disorder is one of these sequels which is generalized in type with myoclonic seizure in infancy and childhood and later tonic-clonic and atypical absence seizures predominate. Also many of the survivors have acute or progressive extra pyramidal syndrome due to bilateral necrosis of basal ganglia.Chronic progressive formsNon specific Developmental delay, hypotonia, muscular weakness, microcephaly and seizures are rarely the only revealing signs in organic acidemia without any acute presentation.Seizures may become refractory to Anti Epileptic Drugs. In addition many asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infants have been identified during tandem mass spectrometry newborn screening program. Cognitive deterioration associated with movement disorder such as dystonia or chorea may be caused by any form of organic aciduria.",

      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

Therapy in constipation mainly relies on the use of bulk-forming agents, in addition to a change in behaviour. Dietary fibre, particularly bran, appears to be effective in diverticular disease. Bowel atony is largely caused by increased sympathetic activity, and thus frequently responds to sympatholysis. In the irritable bowel syndrome, amelioration is achieved by taking bran and omitting badly tolerated food; antispasmodics and psychotherapy are also probably beneficial. Diarrhoea and incontinence may be treated by opioids, such as loperamide. Recent progress has been mainly in the understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders, but rapid therapeutic advances are now taking place.",

      "title": "The Natural History and Diagnosis of Nicotine Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addicted smokers experience nicotine withdrawal anytime they go too long without smoking. Withdrawal presents as a continuum of symptoms of escalating severity described by smokers as \"wanting,\" then \"craving,\" and eventually \"needing\" to smoke. These may be followed by irritability, impatience, moodiness, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and sleep disturbances. This spectrum of intensifying withdrawal symptoms creates a compulsion to smoke that makes quitting difficult. The compulsion to smoke is the core feature of nicotine addiction accounting for its clinical course, physiological characteristics, prognosis, and behavioral manifestations. A compulsion can develop quickly, having been experienced by one third of youth who have smoked only 3 or 4 cigarettes. Its physiologic basis is evident in neurophysiological measures and its recurrence after each cigarette at a characteristic interval. At first, a single cigarette can keep withdrawal at bay for weeks, but as addiction progresses, cigarettes must be smoked at progressively shorter intervals to suppress withdrawal symptoms. The physiologic need to repeatedly self-administer nicotine at shorter intervals explains a full spectrum of addictive symptoms ranging from the prodromal symptom of wanting, to chain smoking. The early process of nicotine addiction is recognized if a person experiences regular wanting for a cigarette. When symptoms include craving or needing, the now addicted patient is experiencing a compulsion to smoke. This simple diagnostic approach covers the full spectrum of addiction in smokers of all ages and levels of tobacco use, and is more valid than a clinical diagnosis based on the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria.",

      "title": "Psychosis: impact on the patient and family.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

In addition to these comorbidities, repeated sexual abuse and a major depressive episode are also presents (ICD-10). Sexual abuse in addition to being more frequent in patients with disabilities (PC included) also seems to be, according to the literature, related to eating behavior disorder.

A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

Rather, these patients usually have a functional gastrointestinal disorder (functional nausea and vomiting).This article describes the three important syndromes in adults that clinicians need to recognise: cyclic vomiting syndrome, functional vomiting, and chronic idiopathic nausea.Cyclic vomiting syndrome presents with stereotypical episodes of acute nausea and vomiting that may be severe. Patients are generally well between attacks. Cannabis use can cause a similar syndrome. Patients may respond to antimigraine therapy or low dose tricyclic antidepressant treatment. Functional vomiting is rare and presents with more frequent vomiting episodes. Rumination needs to be distinguished from functional vomiting by careful history taking. Tricyclic antidepressants are also useful in functional vomiting whether or not there is associated depression. Chronic idiopathic nausea refers to patients with bothersome nausea occurring several times a week usually not associated with vomiting. Its treatment is poorly defined but a trial of antidepressant therapy anecdotally can be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Of 230 adults admitted for self poisoning over two months, 153 (67%) had previously been taking a total of 309 prescribed drugs. Of these patients, 119 (78%) had been given psychotropic drugs (usually benzodiazepines), 81 (53%) obtained them on repeat prescription, and 47 (31%) had been prescribed multiple psychotropic drugs, often in seemingly illogical combinations. The use of these drugs increased progressively with age and most patients took the same drugs in overdosage as they had been prescribed. Psychotropic drugs were prescribed for more than a third of patients with no psychiatric illness and a normal personality, nearly half of those with existing alcohol or drug abuse problems, and for most of the unemployed. Fewer than a third of the patients suffering from depression were prescribed antidepressants but half had been given benzodiazepines and other potentially depressing drugs. Psychotropic drug use, psychotropic polypharmacy, and the repeat prescribing of these drugs were strongly associated with repeated overdosage and, under certain circumstances, with personality disorder, alcohol or drug abuse, unemployment, and conflict with the law. In the long term psychotropic drugs are unlikely to benefit most self poisoners, and they may do positive harm by inducing apathy and depression and predisposing to self poisoning. The incidence of self poisoning (and repeat overdosage in particular) might be reduced by more care and restraint in the prescribing of these drugs.",

      "abstract": "Feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are serious mental health disorders that cause impairments in physical health, development, cognition and psychosocial function and can go undetected for months or years. They are characterised by disturbed eating behaviour associated with concerns about weight and shape or by disinterest in food, phobic avoidance or avoidance due to sensory aspects of food. Restrictive forms of FEDs lead to significant weight loss requiring intervention. Without specific knowledge of these conditions, they can evade detection, delaying time to diagnosis and treatment and potentially influencing outcome. This review article focuses on the key factors involved in the psychiatric assessment and treatment of four feeding or eating disorders (EDs): anorexia nervosa, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. They have been chosen for discussion as they are most likely to be encountered in both a psychiatric and paediatric setting. It emphasises the importance of a family-focused, developmentally appropriate and multidisciplinary approach to care. It does not address aspects of medical assessment and treatment. Other feeding or EDs not included in this article are pica, rumination disorder, other specified feeding and eating disorder and unspecified feeding and eating disorder.",

Muscle dysmorphia is a specifier (subtype) of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) characterized by pathologic preoccupation with muscularity and fear or anxiety about not being big or muscular enough, despite having an objectively normal or muscular body—or even a very muscular build. It is most often seen in males; average age at onset is before the end of the second decade. This preoccupation with body image often compromises social and occupational functioning, in part because of compulsive and meticulous exercise and dietary regimens. Individuals may avoid bodily exposure because of shame associated with perceived small body build. There is significant comorbid medical, social, and psychological disease burden, including disordered eating, other forms of BDD, anxiety, and substance use disorders (often steroid abuse). Treatment is challenging, as many patients do not present to a clinician.",

Sabemos que los TCA se encuentran comúnmente asociados a los trastornos por abuso de sustancias, especialmente al trastorno por abuso de alcohol. Parece que ciertos factores sociodemográficos, ambientales y genéticos, así como mecanismos neurobiológicos o rasgos de personalidad, contribuyen a dicha comorbilidad. En este sentido, cabe destacar patrones de activación cerebral similares y características como la impulsividad, la inestabilidad emocional o los antecedentes de trauma. Presentamos el caso de una mujer de 26 años, vecina de un pueblo de Asturias que vive con sus padres y sus dos hermanos menores. Soltera, sin hijos. Fisioterapeuta de profesión, se encuentra en situación de interrupción laboral temporal desde hace unos meses. Clínica compatible con TCA desde los 14 años, en un inicio el cuadro encaja con un patrón restrictivo pero progresivamente empiezan a predominar los atracones y conductas purgativas. Durante los últimos años, coincidiendo con el curso de sus estudios superiores y el inicio de su vida laboral, lleva una vida desorganizada, carente de hábitos y rutinas, con niveles altos de inestabilidad y conductas autodestructivas. Además de lo concerniente a la comida, se recogen consumo perjudicial de alcohol en patrón \"binge-drinking\", relaciones sexuales de riesgo, sobreingestas medicamentosas y cortes autoinfligidos, así como episodios de heteroagresividad. La paciente ingresa en la unidad de hospitalización de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria tras meses aislada en el domicilio con atracones y vómitos diarios. Durante el mismo, revela una historia de abusos durante la infancia, perpetrados por un pariente lejano. En este caso, concurren varios de los factores de riesgo citados. Ahondar en la investigación de estas asociaciones podría mejorar el abordaje y tratamiento de este tipo de pacientes.",

      "title": "The effect of leucotomy in intractable adolescent weight phobia (primary anorexia nervosa)",
      "abstract": "Summary Anorexia nervosa is best construed as a phobic avoidance response to the psychosocial maturational implications of adolescent weight. Within this state, surrender to the impulse to eat and consequent weight gain is associated with panic, depression and sometimes specific intense fear of loss of control. So long as the avoidance posture can be maintained the experience of such turmoil is largely avoided. Complicated ritualistic behaviour may arise to promote and secure the posture. However, its unrewarding and lonely nature still increasingly leaves the individual liable to the experience of depression. Established treatment procedures often assist recovery from the illness but intractable cases arise and it is amongst these that the majority of deaths occur either from inanition or suicide. The basis for the changes characteristically induced by leucotomy is complex. The procedure often leads to reduced tension and release of appetitive behaviour. This is taken to be due to some direct effect of the cerebral lesion and possibly the intervention may also be construed by some patients as a licence to behave differently. In patients with anorexia nervosa such appetitive release can be expected to promote considerable weight gain. However, the adverse psychological implications of such weight gain for the patient do not appear always to be so immediately or easily relieved. They may still experience panic, shame or depression and new patterns of social avoidance, or vomiting behaviour may develop. Intensive help of a psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative kind is then still required if the patient is to have the best chance of adjusting healthily to her newly found potential for a more normal nutritional status. Four patients who have undergone such treatment are described in this paper. It is concluded that leucotomy has a small but definite place in the treatment of patients with intractable anorexia nervosa.",

We report on a 9 month-old infant with myoclonic attacks, which consisted of frequent clusters of up to 10 symmetric jerks affecting mainly the arms and the head occurring as reflex responses to unexpected auditory stimuli. There was no family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Ictal EEG demonstrated a typical 3 Hz spike-wave pattern, while there were no abnormalities, either in wakefulness or during sleep. The neurodevelopmental examination was unremarkable and MRI of the brain was normal. The attacks disappeared 3 weeks after initiating sodium valproate, and have not reappeared since then (follow-up 3 years and 3 months); today, at 4 years of age, the patient has normal psycho-motor development. RMEI should be considered as an age-dependent, idiopathic, generalized epileptic syndrome with an apparently good prognosis[Published with video sequences].",

      "abstract": "Insomnia has numerous, often concurrent etiologies, including medical conditions, medications, psychiatric disorders and poor sleep hygiene. In the elderly, insomnia is complex and often difficult to relieve because the physiologic parameters of sleep normally change with age. In most cases, however, a practical management approach is to first consider depression, medications, or both, as potential causes. Sleep apnea also should be considered in the differential assessment. Regardless of the cause of insomnia, most patients benefit from behavioral approaches that focus on good sleep habits. Exposure to bright light at appropriate times can help realign the circadian rhythm in patients whose sleep-wake cycle has shifted to undesirable times. Periodic limb movements during sleep are very common in the elderly and may merit treatment if the movements cause frequent arousals from sleep. When medication is deemed necessary for relief of insomnia, a low-dose sedating antidepressant or a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic may offer advantages over traditional sedative-hypnotics. Longterm use of long-acting benzodiazepines should, in particular, be avoided. Melatonin may be helpful when insomnia is related to shift work and jet lag; however, its use remains controversial.",

The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Acute symptomatic seizures are those caused or provoked by an\r\nacute medical or neurological insult and it is as common as epilepsy in the\r\nmedical wards. Acute symptomatic seizures differ from epilepsy in several\r\nimportant aspects. First, unlike epilepsy, these seizures have a clearly\r\nidentifiable proximate cause, to the extent that one can never be certain of\r\na causal association. When one considers the temporal sequence of acute\r\nsymptomatic seizures (e.g.uremia, head injury, or stroke immediately\r\npreceding a seizure), the biologic plausibility (acute disruption of brain\r\nintegrity or metabolic homeostasis) and in many cases the dose effect\r\n(severity of injury correlated with the risk for seizures) all quite\r\ncompellingly indicate causation. Although a risk ratio for the immediate\r\nassociation between cause and effect has not been calculated, it must be\r\nenormous. Second, unlike epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures are not\r\ncharacterized by a tendency to recur. The risk for subsequent epilepsy may\r\nbe increased in individuals experiencing such insults; in general, one does\r\nnot expect seizures to recur unless the underlying condition recurs. \r\nThe maximum incidence of seizures occurred in the age group of 60\r\nto 70 years in the study.\r\nCerebrovascular disease was the most common etiology observed in\r\nour study. Among cerebrovascular disease, ischemic cerebral\r\ninfarction was the most common cause. Central nervous system\r\ninfections, was the second most common cause followed by\r\nmetabolic causes in our study. So all efforts should be taken to\r\nevaluate the patients who presented with seizures in the elderly\r\npatients to identify the etiology, for accurate management.\r\nPartial seizures was the most common seizure type encountered in\r\nthe study.\r\nImmediate non contrast CT brain was useful, for emergency\r\npatients, presenting with seizures to guide appropriate acute\r\nmanagement. MRI Brain was useful in detecting lesions, which were\r\nmissed in CT Brain. Both CT Brain and MRI Brain were\r\nindispensable in patients with acute symptomatic seizures in the\r\nelderly.",

      "abstract": "The decrease in deaths from the inhalation of toxic fumes may be related to the gradual effect of legislation in some countries on the banning of toxic substances in furnishing items.The continued substantial death rate from carbon monoxide poisoning is disappointing but may be related to the fact that although smoke alarms are more readily found in dwellings, they are often non-functional.The decline in mortality from drug poisoning may be due both to more effective treatment and possibly to the more widespread use of less toxic antidepressant drugs. Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation. F.2 Primary assessment and resuscitation in poisoningz Respiratory rate: the rate may be increased in poisoning from amphetamines, ecstasy, salicylates, ethylene glycol and methanol z Acidotic sighing respirations: this may suggest metabolic acidosis from salicylates or ethylene glycol poisoning as a cause for the coma z Heart rate: tachycardia is caused by amphetamines, ecstasy, β-agonists, phenothiazines, theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); bradycardia is caused by β-blockers, digoxin and organophosphates z Blood pressure: hypotension is commonly seen in serious poisoning; hypertension is caused by ecstasy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors z If heart rate is above 200 beats/min in an infant or above 150 beats/min in a child, or if the rhythm is abnormal, perform cardiac monitoring.QRS prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are seen in TCA poisoning z Depression of conscious level suggests poisoning with opiates, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), antihistamines and hypoglycaemic agents z Pupillary size and reaction should be noted.Very small pupils suggest opiate or organophosphate poisoning; large pupils suggest amphetamines, atropine and TCAs 10.",

      "abstract": "Delay discounting, the belief that rewards decline in value over time, is a phenomenon observed in several clinical disorders, including Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), substance abuse disorders, and other impulse control disorders. Delay discounting behavior is characterized by a tendency to choose smaller, more immediate rewards over larger, more delayed rewards. This tendency has been associated with behavioral impulsivity and inability to delay gratification observed in the aforementioned clinical disorders. It has been suggested that time perception may be a salient feature of delay discounting. If the larger, longer-term reward is perceived as being more temporally remote, its relative value decreases and is associated with greater cost, and one becomes more likely to choose the more immediate reward over the longer-term (though optimal) choice. Time perception has been studied in clinical populations, with increased variability of responses as well as both under-production and overestimation of time intervals observed in those with ADHD and other disorders",

      "abstract": "Pathological gambling is classified as a disorder of impulse control, though many of its diagnostic criteria parallel those found in substance use disorders. A number of unitary and complex biopsychosocial conceptual models have been postulated to account for the multifactorial nature of gambling pathology. These models have implications for varied treatment approaches in the management of pathological gambling. Recovery is a diffused concept that has been variously and inconsistently determined by the remission or absence of clinical symptoms, the absence of diagnostic criteria, or the achievement of personal development, independence, and function. The lack of conceptual clarity and definitional precision make it difficult to ascertain the actual efficacy of interventions or their relative effectiveness when compared to similar treatments in different population settings or to different treatment approaches. Future investigations should clearly conceptualize the concept of recovery to evaluate the nature and extent of improvement along a spectrum that includes measurement of (a) decreases in frequency of and the time spent gambling, (b) abstinence or controlled gambling that meets financial obligations, (c) absence of symptoms of impaired control and cross-addicted behaviors, and (d) absence of negative consequences and improved quality of life over time.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Koro syndrome is a culturally related disorder characterized by intense anxiety that the penis (vulva or nipples in females) is shrinking or retracting and will recede into the body. Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

      "title": "Compulsive behavior in fur animals",
      "abstract": "Fur animals kept indoors, due to partial limitation of their natural behavior, are more likely to develop behavioral disorders. This is due to negative emotions associated with inability to satisfy certain needs or achieve a particular purpose, which leads to frustration or deprivation in animals. This condition can lead to the emergence of compulsive behaviors, which are often a form of coping with stress. Compulsive behaviors in fur animals are usually stereotypical: animals walk along the cage, catch their own tail, gnaw fur (trichotilomanie), or bite the trellis or the claws. The environmental factors resulting from the maintenance conditions and social relations of the animals in the group play an important role in the emergence of this type of behavior. Another factor that is equally important in causing compulsive behavior is mental strain resulting from disease..",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) is characterized by recurrent obsessions or compulsions causing marked distress. The lifetime prevalence of OCD in general population is estimated about 2~3%. OCD can usually be distinguished from psychosis by the facts that the patients recognize the irrational nature of the symptoms. OCD is also different from obsessive-compulsive personality in that the patients suffer from obsessions and compulsions which accompany marked distress. The etiology of OCD is not know yet. However, numerous studies suggest that OCD may be associated with several psychological and neurobiological factors such as functional abnormalities of cortico-striatal circuit and serotonin.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI) are the first-line drugs for the treatmemt of OCD. Approximately 50~80% of OCD patients improved with these anti-obsessional drugs with average reduction in symptoms between 30~70%. Benefits may not appear for 2 or more weeks. Continuing a medication for more than 10 weeks is required to determine the anti-obsessional efficacy. Maintenance treatment is usually required for more than several months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy also proved to be effective, particularly for patients with prominent compulsions. Therefore, it is a logical choice to combine pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. For extreme cases electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) or stereotaxic neurosurgery may be considered. However, at present, neurosurgery is recommended only for a few patients who remained severely disabled even after years of sufficient treatments.",

      "abstract": "Embitterment is seen in reaction to injustice, vilification, or humiliation. Similar to anxiety, it is known to everybody, but it can also occur in the context of mental disorders and even become an illness in itself. The goal of the present study is to describe the spectrum of the types, rate, intensity, and clinical context of embitterment manifestations.The posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED) self-rating scale was used to screen for reactive embitterment in 1,479 psychosomatic inpatients. Of these, 489 patients showed increased scores and were interviewed with a standardized diagnostic interview investigating embitterment and the life events that elicit it.Feelings of embitterment, irrespective of intensity, were known to 86.5% of the sample and associated with impairment in daily life. Four different types of patients could be identified: (a) nonreactive embitterment or embitterment-prone personality (i.e., increased embitterment without reports about specific negative life events), (b) complex embitterment (i.e., increased embitterment in the context of multiple negative life events), (c) PTED in reaction to a single traumatic event, and (d) secondary embitterment (i.e., increased embitterment in the context of other mental disorders).Embitterment is part of the normal spectrum of emotions, but it is also relevant in mental disorders. Increased embitterment can be part of other mental illnesses, such as personality disorders, but it also constitutes a state of illness in itself in the form of embitterment-prone personality, PTED, or complex PTED.

Second, constipation has a multifactorial and complex etiology, including not only anatomical and functional, but also dietary, psychological, and cultural factors. Third, this symptom is still surrounded by misconceptions and taboos, which hamper an objective evaluation and determine self-medication, not always innocuous to the patient.

      "abstract": "Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is plagued by many artifacts, that sometimes closely mimic pathology.[1] We review the most common artifacts in clinical practice.[2] 2.1 Motion artifacts Optic neuritis is characterized by T2 hyperintensity of the optic nerves [Fig. 1a]. Similar changes can also be produced by motion artifacts [Fig. 1b], which are recognizable by the associated blurring of nerve outlines and ghosting [Fig. 1b and c]. Repeating the scan with the patient fixing the gaze removes these artifacts [Fig. 1d].Figure 1: (a) Bilateral optic neuritis, (b) Eye motion during scanning causes motion artifacts, (c) Motion also produces ghosting and blurring, (d) Repeat MRI of the patient in Figure 1b during eye fixation2.2 Partial volume artifacts Signal changes similar to optic neuritis [Fig. 2a] can occasionally be seen in normal optic nerves [Fig. 2b]. This occurs when the nerves are tortuous and the MR section includes adjacent fat, which artifactually increases signal in the nerve [Fig. 2c]. Fat suppressed sequences [Fig. 2d] are immune to this artifact.Figure 2: (a) Right optic neuritis, (b) Similar changes in both optic nerves produced by partial volume artifact, (c) Genesis of partial volume artifacts, (d) Fat saturated scan shows normal optic nervesSimilar phenomena can affect the extraocular muscles. Extraocular muscles are enlarged and show T2 hyperintensity in disorders such as orbital myositis [Fig. 3a] and thyroid ophthalmopathy. However, even normally, the lateral rectus muscles can appear bulky and hyperintense to rest of the muscles on coronal images [Fig. 3b]. Oblique orientation of lateral rectus muscles to the coronal plane makes them more susceptible to this phenomenon [Fig. 3c].Figure 3: (a) Orbital myositis, (b) Bulky, hyperintense lateral rectus muscles in a normal individual, (c) Obliquity of lateral rectus makes it more prone for partial volume artifact2.3 Susceptibility artifact Signal changes produced by disorders affecting the inferior rectus muscle, such as myositis [Fig. 4a] can occasionally be seen on fat saturated sequences, in individuals with metallic dental implants [Fig. 4b]. Disturbance of the magnetic field along the floor of the orbit by dental implants or air in the maxillary sinus interferes with fat saturation and creates a false appearance of edematous changes [Fig. 4c]. The artefact is recognizable as it extends beyond the muscle boundaries and is worst inferiorly. A similar artefact can be seen when the patient uses eye makeup (mascara) containing metallic iron particles.Figure 4: (a) Inferior rectus myositis, (b) Susceptibility artefact due to dental implants (*) causes hyperintensity of all tissues along the orbital floor, (c) Magnetic field disturbance by the metallic dental implant extends into the orbital floor (dotted line)2.4 Chemical shift artifact The appearance of tumor deposits along the optic nerve [Fig. 5a] can be seen even in normal individuals [Fig. 5b] as the so-called \"Chemical shift artifact.\" This artifact is typically seen at the interface between fluid and fat containing structures (such as optic nerve and retroorbital fat) as a band of dark signal intensity on one side (along the frequency encoding direction). This is caused by \"mis-mapping\" (shift) of the signal from retroorbital fat, in relation to the perioptic fluid [Fig. 5c]. Fat suppressed sequences [Fig. 5d] are immune to this artifact.Figure 5: (a) Leukemic deposits on left optic nerve, (b) Curvilinear bands of bright and dark signal along superior and inferior aspects of optic nerves in a normal individual, (c) Illustration of chemical shift artifact, (d) Fat saturated scan in the same individual shows normal optic nervesThis artifact is also seen at the margin of fat containing structures surrounded by fluid (e.g., silicone oil in the globe or intracranial lipomas) and fluid containing structures surrounded by fat (e.g., cysts or hemangiomas within the retroorbital fat). Presence of this artifact gives vital clues in the diagnosis of these conditions. 2.5 Financial support and sponsorship Nil. 2.6 Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

Athletes suffering from NFOR/overtraining syndrome (OTS) might not present with 'textbook symptoms'; instead, they could be asymptomatic, display a myriad of individualised symptoms or exhibit normal symptoms of acute fatigue. The protocol involves two graded exercise tests to exhaustion with a 4-h rest between bouts and involves measures of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and prolactin (PRL), measured at four time points: baseline, immediately after completion of the first test, prior to the second test and immediately after the second test. An important feature of NFOR/OTS is the inability to sustain exercise performance, and several studies have indicated NFOR using simulated or sport-specific performance testing such as incremental testing, time to exhaustion and competition performance. Disturbances in mood state are often reported in athletes suffering OTS and appear to be sensitive to periods of intensified training in both endurance and strength sports.",

      "title": "Typical Absence Seizure Similarity to “Shokhous” in Iranian Traditional Medicine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nIn allopathic medicine, absence seizure is a kind of generalized seizure characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control (1, 2). Typical absence only lasts for a few seconds and consciousness returns suddenly as it was lost, without postictal confusion (3).\r\n\r\n“Shokhous” or “Jomoud” in Iranian traditional medicine is a disease in which patients suddenly lose their sensations and movements and they look as if they are slept. The patients keep their posture and their eyes open or close the same as before attack, but usually are open and fixed.\r\n\r\nIf you talk to them, they do not understand or respond. Feeding or awakening them is impossible even by force. These attacks occur in a short time (4). According to the Avicenna, sensations completely vanish, but movements remain, because patients can breathe normally (5).\r\n\r\nIn Iranian traditional medicine, “Shokhous” is not classified as a kind of seizure but as a sleep disorder (4).\r\n\r\n“Shokhous” signs are similar to signs of typical absence seizure, therefore, they might be the same disease; however, in absence seizure diagnosis, EEG is an important criterion (2, 6), and there was not EEG in ancient age.\r\n\r\nIn most traditional medicine references, “Shokhous” is caused by a “soddeh” (meaning obstruction), in the posterior ventricle placed in the back part of brain. The substance known as “soda” (black bile) leads to this obstruction (4).\r\n\r\nAccording to Iranian traditional medicine, there are 4 basic qualities in body elements: warmth, coldness, moisture, and dryness (5).\r\n\r\nThe body is composed of 4 humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and its health is based on the right proportion and specific balance of humors according to their quality and quantity. Each of them is similar to one of the 4 elements (air, water, fire, and earth) in the temperament and its activity. The black bile is similar to earth element and has some characteristics like stability, rigidity, and hardness. Black bile is divided into two categories: normal black bile and abnormal black bile. Any decrease of normal black bile in the body leads to rise in abnormal black bile, which causes a disorder (7, 8).\r\n\r\nIn “Shokhous,” abnormal black bile rises in the brain and causes higher than normal dryness and coldness (4).\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis of “Shokhous” in Iranian traditional medicine comprises the following diseases:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sar” (tonic-clonic seizure): The attack of “Sar” causes patients to squirm and produce convulsive movements; but “Shokhous” does not cause movement, on the contrary, it stops body movements for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sobat” (stupor): In “Sobat,” eyes are closed, it does not start and finish suddenly. The patient takes time to return to its normal state, and we can force the patient to understand or talk during “Sobat.” On the contrary, in “Shokhous” eyes are often open, it starts and finishes abruptly, it lasts a short time and if you talk to them, they do not understand or answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sadare khaderi” (orthostatic hypotension): Dizziness unlike “Shokhous” is the main symptom of this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sekte” (stroke): Unlike “Shokhous,” force-feeding is possible in “Sekte.” \r\n\r\n\r\n“Sarsame bared” (a kind of meningitis): Patients can move eyes, close eyelids, change the posture, even speak a little, and there is fever in this disease but none of these signs and symptoms are reported in the “Shokhous” attack (4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIn the allopathic medicine, valproic acid, ethosuxsimide, and lamotrigine are the drugs of choice to control absence seizures (9, 10).\r\n\r\nIn Iranian traditional medicine, treatment is divided into two parts: prevention and therapy. Prevention consists of not eating some foods like eggplant, marinades, mushroom, and cabbage which produce more “soda” in the patient’s body.\r\n\r\nTherapy comprises enema with herbals such as “aftymoun” (Cuscuta epithymum), “basfayej” (Polypodium vulgare), “halile” (Terminalia chebula), and “ghariqoun” (Polyporus officinalis). According to the Iranian traditional medicine, these plants are used because of their special ability to extract “soda.” Also enema is more useful to cleanup brain but this treatment is helpful when body is strong enough. If energy is insufficient, enema with “Mae nokhale” (water bran), “varaghe salgh” (beet leaf), and dissolved oil, something like “booragh” (a kind of mineral), and “shahme hanzal” (Citrullus colocynthis) or other “ayarajate moshele” soda that are usable to extract soda, are helpful (4).\r\n\r\nAccording to this study, more research is suggested to assess the effect of this treatment in Iranian traditional medicine.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Cluster Headaches",
      "abstract": "Historically, cluster headache has been known by many names, including erythromelalgia, erythroprosopalgia of Bing, hemicrania periodic neuralgiforms, histamine cephalalgia, Horton headache, migrainous neuralgia, petrosal neuralgia, and sphenopalatine neuralgia. Our patient might simply label his as a margarita and Chardonnay headache. This 50-year-old white man has a 5-year history of headaches described as an 8/10 in intensity stabbing in the left temple and sometimes around the left ear associated with tearing and redness of the left eye, congestion of the left nares, and light and noise sensitivity but no aura. During a headache, he prefers to sit or lie down. Without treatment, the headache lasts about 2 hours. Since the onset, the headache has been triggered almost all of the time by alcoholic beverages with the onset 30-45 minutes later. Perhaps one time per year the headache occurs spontaneously. The headaches have been triggered by drinking white or red wine, margaritas, beer, vodka, and grappa. Every evening, he usually drinks 3 margaritas and 2 glasses of Chardonnay and occasionally other alcoholic beverages. He does not drink at other times of the day. About twice a month, he has 6 or more drinks. He scores a 16 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). (A score of 8 or more indicates a strong likelihood of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in adult populations.) The headaches are invariably triggered by lesser and greater amounts of alcohol intake. The headache goes away in about 30 minutes if he takes zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray or tablet or rizatriptan 10 mg at the onset. A few weeks after starting a triptan, he noticed that if he takes any of these triptans 5 minutes before his first drink, he only gets a headache about once a month. He has been taking one of these triptans on a daily basis for 3.5 years. If he does not take the triptan preemptively before drinking, he will get a headache. One hundred percent oxygen at 12 liters per minute was not effective. Topirimate was not effective for prevention. He was prescribed verapamil on a number of occasions but did not start the medication. Despite multiple recommendations, he did not seek counseling for alcohol abuse. The unknown risk of daily triptan use was discussed with the patient several times. Past medical history was otherwise negative. He smokes one pack per day. He has a white-collar job working in sales. Neurological examination is normal. Questions.— How common and what are the triggers in cluster headache? To be considered a trigger, how long after exposure to the trigger should the headache begin? How often is alcohol a trigger and what types? Will greater amounts of alcohol trigger a headache as often as lesser amounts? Is it common for cluster headache to occur only after exposure to a trigger such as alcohol and not spontaneously? What is the evidence for efficacy of triptans taken before a trigger to prevent a headache? Is alcohol consumption more in those with episodic or chronic cluster? How might alcohol trigger the headaches? This patient combines many interesting aspects of primary headache disorders. The clinical presentation including 8/10 pain intensity located around the left temple with ipsilateral tearing and reddening of the eye as well as nasal congestion lasting for 2 hours suggests the diagnosis of cluster headache (CH) compatible with the International Headache Society criteria from 2004.1 The presence of attacks for 5 years without remission would classify him as suffering from chronic CH. Although the vast majority of patients experience pain in the orbital/temporal region, it has recently been shown that up to one-fourth of chronic CH sufferers report pain around the ear (like in our patient) and in more distant sites.2,3 The other symptoms like photo- and phonophobia as well as the desire to lie down have “traditionally” been ascribed to migraine, but are also compatible with CH. Recent studies have shown that photo- and phonophobia occur in about 50-65% of patients during CH attacks.2-5 I am not aware of any data regarding the desire to rest. Yet, only about 45-90% of CH patients report restlessness2-5 and this feature seems to be particularly low in chronic CH sufferers.3 It may well be that some patients with no feeling of restlessness have indeed the desire to rest and a number of my patients have reported this. Cluster headache attacks typically occur spontaneously, as seen by the circadian and circannual pattern. Furthermore, during active episodes, certain triggers may provoke additional attacks, sometimes even when successful preventive treatment is implemented.6 However, in between episodes attacks cannot be triggered. Alcohol is a well-known potent trigger for CH attacks, first described by Horton in 1941.7 It elicits attacks in about 50-80% of patients,2,4,8 less frequently in chronic (54%) than in episodic CH (65%).2 Red wine seems to be particularly potent, as it was reported to elicit attacks in about 70% of patients in one study.4 This may in part be ascribed to certain congeners, byproducts of alcohol fermentation. Our patient, however, experiences attacks following various kinds of alcohol including those without congeners (vodka, grappa). The latency of attack onset after alcohol ingestion (30-45 minutes) is compatible with a previous study.4 There are early reports that in some patients with chronic CH alcohol consumption may ameliorate attacks9 or lead to remission for a period of time proportional to the amount consumed.10 However, the number of patients was too small to draw meaningful conclusions (2 out of 17 patients in the former and 3 out of 5 patients in the latter report). From my experience, there are no thresholds beyond which alcohol either elicits or ameliorates CH attacks. Also, there is no strict rule as to how long after the exposure of a certain “agent” a CH attack has to occur in order to be called a trigger. However, data from studies using the nitroglycerin provocative test (NPT) may be helpful in defining such a rule. Using the NPT, all CH attacks occurred within 3 hours after application, mostly within 45 minutes.11 In contrast, migraine attacks may occur with a delayed onset after up to 8 hours.11 This arbitrary “3-hour rule” may be applied to alcohol, which would be compatible with our patient. Yet, 2 aspects should be considered here. First, it is not applicable in a patient with 5 spontaneous CH attacks per day, for instance, as distinguishing between spontaneous and triggered attacks will be impossible. Second, it is questionable if this rule can be applied to other triggers as well. Among those triggers are stress (40%), weather (29%), fatigue (27%), physical activity (17%), tobacco (16%), rest (14%), smells (14%), food (10%), altitudes (9%), and menses (3%).3 In our patient, we are facing the rare instance of only one spontaneous attack per year while all the other ones are triggered by alcohol. The patient's history, in particular an AUDIT score of 16, refusing to seek counseling for alcohol abuse, and employing triptans to be able to continue alcohol consumption without getting CH attacks, clearly demonstrates that alcohol consumption as opposed to the CH is the patient's major problem. Early studies have reported that the vast majority of CH sufferers drank alcohol excessively and patients with chronic CH seemed to drink more than those with episodic CH.12-14 In addition, in a Swedish study, 67% of CH patients had scores indicative of high alcohol consumption using the Malmö modification of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test.8 However, a large Italian multicenter case–control study did not find a difference in drinking behavior between CH patients and controls,15 and a German study found a lower alcohol consumption among CH patients compared with controls.16 In addition, chronic CH patients drank much less frequently than episodic CH patients.16 Only one-fifth of patients were identified as hazardous alcohol consumers using the AUDIT. Considering the trigger potential of alcohol, this makes intuitive sense and is in line with study results showing that 79% of CH patients decrease their alcohol consumption during headache periods.8 Inhaled oxygen and sumatriptan injection are the treatments of choice when it comes to terminating CH attacks.17 Triptans as nasal sprays and tablets are also effective, yet probably to a lesser degree. Employment of preventive medications like steroids, verapamil, and topiramate may be complicated by a number of factors, including adverse side effect profile, need for slow titration, bradycardia, impaired cognition, etc. As attacks often occur during the night, thus precluding timely application of acute medication, and as some episodes only last 2 or 3 weeks, the idea of time-adjusted and short-term prophylaxis has been introduced. Taking a long-acting triptan like frovatriptan once or twice daily for a limited period of time has been shown to be successful in preventing attacks and to be safe.18 However, a note of caution must be given here, owing to the possibility of medication overuse headache (MOH) with prolonged use. For a long time, the notion prevailed that CH patients cannot develop MOH; however, it has recently been reported that frequent use of subcutaneous sumatriptan can indeed increase attack frequency in CH.19 In addition, the risk of prolonged regular triptan use is unknown in CH. It is still not fully understood how triptans work in CH; however, owing to the many similarities between CH and migraine, a related mode of action may be postulated. Pharmacologically, triptans activate 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors on cerebral and peripheral vessels and on peripheral and central neurons.20 Stimulation of vascular 5-HT1B receptors causes vasoconstriction, which may provoke ischemia, particularly in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors like smoking, as in our patient. Another striking aspect about this patient is that he consistently and reliably can prevent alcohol-induced CH attacks with triptans. Despite alcohol being a potent CH attack trigger, as sketched above, it is speculative whether this is due to its vasoactive properties, due to one of its complex central nervous system mechanisms21 or whether several of these mechanisms act in synergy. It seems unlikely that the effect is solely attributable to congeners, as this patient reports the same effects with red wine and vodka, for instance. It may be hypothesized that alcohol causes attacks through vasodilation, which can be terminated by the vasoconstrictor properties of triptans, and also that the vasoconstrictor properties of triptans taken early may prevent alcohol-induced vasodilation and thus CH attacks. However, owing to the neurovascular theory of CH pathogenesis, which is only marginally understood by now, this view appears rather simplistic and does not account for the involvement of brain structures like the hypothalamus and the brain stem.22 In summary, this is a very special case of CH. While the clinical criteria for CH are fulfilled, the patient also presents uncommon symptoms. In addition, he appears to be in a chronic state with a very low spontaneous attack frequency. In contrast, his daily attacks are all triggered by alcohol. As the patient is likely alcohol-dependent, drinking every night, this creates the main problem for him. Apart from the alcohol-associated health hazards, he is willing to accept the unknown risk of daily triptan intake. The only therapy for him appears to stop drinking (with professional help), but he is incompliant. Abstinence from alcohol would likely dramatically reduce his attack frequency, leaving him potentially needless of preventive medication. In addition, he might turn out to be responsive to oxygen after all.",

      "title": "Alcohol and Cluster Headaches",
      "abstract": "Historically, cluster headache has been known by many names, including erythromelalgia, erythroprosopalgia of Bing, hemicrania periodic neuralgiforms, histamine cephalalgia, Horton headache, migrainous neuralgia, petrosal neuralgia, and sphenopalatine neuralgia. Our patient might simply label his as a margarita and Chardonnay headache. This 50-year-old white man has a 5-year history of headaches described as an 8/10 in intensity stabbing in the left temple and sometimes around the left ear associated with tearing and redness of the left eye, congestion of the left nares, and light and noise sensitivity but no aura. During a headache, he prefers to sit or lie down. Without treatment, the headache lasts about 2 hours. Since the onset, the headache has been triggered almost all of the time by alcoholic beverages with the onset 30-45 minutes later. Perhaps one time per year the headache occurs spontaneously. The headaches have been triggered by drinking white or red wine, margaritas, beer, vodka, and grappa. Every evening, he usually drinks 3 margaritas and 2 glasses of Chardonnay and occasionally other alcoholic beverages. He does not drink at other times of the day. About twice a month, he has 6 or more drinks. He scores a 16 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). (A score of 8 or more indicates a strong likelihood of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in adult populations.) The headaches are invariably triggered by lesser and greater amounts of alcohol intake. The headache goes away in about 30 minutes if he takes zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray or tablet or rizatriptan 10 mg at the onset. A few weeks after starting a triptan, he noticed that if he takes any of these triptans 5 minutes before his first drink, he only gets a headache about once a month. He has been taking one of these triptans on a daily basis for 3.5 years. If he does not take the triptan preemptively before drinking, he will get a headache. One hundred percent oxygen at 12 liters per minute was not effective. Topirimate was not effective for prevention. He was prescribed verapamil on a number of occasions but did not start the medication. Despite multiple recommendations, he did not seek counseling for alcohol abuse. The unknown risk of daily triptan use was discussed with the patient several times. Past medical history was otherwise negative. He smokes one pack per day. He has a white-collar job working in sales. Neurological examination is normal. Questions.— How common and what are the triggers in cluster headache? To be considered a trigger, how long after exposure to the trigger should the headache begin? How often is alcohol a trigger and what types? Will greater amounts of alcohol trigger a headache as often as lesser amounts? Is it common for cluster headache to occur only after exposure to a trigger such as alcohol and not spontaneously? What is the evidence for efficacy of triptans taken before a trigger to prevent a headache? Is alcohol consumption more in those with episodic or chronic cluster? How might alcohol trigger the headaches? This patient combines many interesting aspects of primary headache disorders. The clinical presentation including 8/10 pain intensity located around the left temple with ipsilateral tearing and reddening of the eye as well as nasal congestion lasting for 2 hours suggests the diagnosis of cluster headache (CH) compatible with the International Headache Society criteria from 2004.1 The presence of attacks for 5 years without remission would classify him as suffering from chronic CH. Although the vast majority of patients experience pain in the orbital/temporal region, it has recently been shown that up to one-fourth of chronic CH sufferers report pain around the ear (like in our patient) and in more distant sites.2, 3 The other symptoms like photo- and phonophobia as well as the desire to lie down have “traditionally” been ascribed to migraine, but are also compatible with CH. Recent studies have shown that photo- and phonophobia occur in about 50-65% of patients during CH attacks.2-5 I am not aware of any data regarding the desire to rest. Yet, only about 45-90% of CH patients report restlessness2-5 and this feature seems to be particularly low in chronic CH sufferers.3 It may well be that some patients with no feeling of restlessness have indeed the desire to rest and a number of my patients have reported this. Cluster headache attacks typically occur spontaneously, as seen by the circadian and circannual pattern. Furthermore, during active episodes, certain triggers may provoke additional attacks, sometimes even when successful preventive treatment is implemented.6 However, in between episodes attacks cannot be triggered. Alcohol is a well-known potent trigger for CH attacks, first described by Horton in 1941.7 It elicits attacks in about 50-80% of patients,2, 4, 8 less frequently in chronic (54%) than in episodic CH (65%).2 Red wine seems to be particularly potent, as it was reported to elicit attacks in about 70% of patients in one study.4 This may in part be ascribed to certain congeners, byproducts of alcohol fermentation. Our patient, however, experiences attacks following various kinds of alcohol including those without congeners (vodka, grappa). The latency of attack onset after alcohol ingestion (30-45 minutes) is compatible with a previous study.4 There are early reports that in some patients with chronic CH alcohol consumption may ameliorate attacks9 or lead to remission for a period of time proportional to the amount consumed.10 However, the number of patients was too small to draw meaningful conclusions (2 out of 17 patients in the former and 3 out of 5 patients in the latter report). From my experience, there are no thresholds beyond which alcohol either elicits or ameliorates CH attacks. Also, there is no strict rule as to how long after the exposure of a certain “agent” a CH attack has to occur in order to be called a trigger. However, data from studies using the nitroglycerin provocative test (NPT) may be helpful in defining such a rule. Using the NPT, all CH attacks occurred within 3 hours after application, mostly within 45 minutes.11 In contrast, migraine attacks may occur with a delayed onset after up to 8 hours.11 This arbitrary “3-hour rule” may be applied to alcohol, which would be compatible with our patient. Yet, 2 aspects should be considered here. First, it is not applicable in a patient with 5 spontaneous CH attacks per day, for instance, as distinguishing between spontaneous and triggered attacks will be impossible. Second, it is questionable if this rule can be applied to other triggers as well. Among those triggers are stress (40%), weather (29%), fatigue (27%), physical activity (17%), tobacco (16%), rest (14%), smells (14%), food (10%), altitudes (9%), and menses (3%).3 In our patient, we are facing the rare instance of only one spontaneous attack per year while all the other ones are triggered by alcohol. The patient's history, in particular an AUDIT score of 16, refusing to seek counseling for alcohol abuse, and employing triptans to be able to continue alcohol consumption without getting CH attacks, clearly demonstrates that alcohol consumption as opposed to the CH is the patient's major problem. Early studies have reported that the vast majority of CH sufferers drank alcohol excessively and patients with chronic CH seemed to drink more than those with episodic CH.12-14 In addition, in a Swedish study, 67% of CH patients had scores indicative of high alcohol consumption using the Malmö modification of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test.8 However, a large Italian multicenter case–control study did not find a difference in drinking behavior between CH patients and controls,15 and a German study found a lower alcohol consumption among CH patients compared with controls.16 In addition, chronic CH patients drank much less frequently than episodic CH patients.16 Only one-fifth of patients were identified as hazardous alcohol consumers using the AUDIT.

At the same time attention should be drawn to the frequently occurring depressive forms of drunkenness, early appearance of the asthenic state, the lack of marked personality changes by the alcoholic type, relative preservation of a critical attitude towards the disease, and to the abortive abstinent syndrome, characterized sometimes by an elevated attitude of mind resembling the hypomaniacal state. Alcoholism tends towards a moderate progredient course, which is often not realized because of the influence of psychic trauma and in that case alcoholism takes a malignant course.",

      "abstract": "All those involved in the care of babies need to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of seizures. Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

Research into the pathogenesis of arousal disorders in adults suggests that they reflect aberrant slow-wave sleep regulation, impaired arousal specifically from NREM 3 sleep, and/or sleep/wake state dissociations. Treatment of DoA includes avoidance of sleep deprivation/restriction, irregular sleep/wake schedules, and predisposing/precipitating factors.

IBS could be corelated with Grahani, a condition caused by the dysfunction of the digestive system due to an imbalance of Agni (digestive fire) based on the homology of symptoms of both. Grahani, the seat of digestion and assimilation, becomes impaired by factors such as stress, improper diet, irregular eating habits, and lifestyle disturbances, leading to improper digestion, irregular bowel movements, and systemic manifestations. The vitiation of Vata and Pitta doshas plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of this condition.",

Clearly, societal pressures (i.e., cultural values of thinness and fitness), obsessional temperament, and perfectionism cannot be illustrated by any animal model, but on the other hand, some strong similarities between self-starvation in rodents and anorexia nervosa can be noted. An activity-based rodent model of anorexia provides a phenomenon (i.e., excessive running, reduced food intake, and subsequent weight loss) that can be easily implemented and effectively used to explore the pathophysiological consequences of semi-starvation and hyperactivity, which are characteristics of anorexia nervosa. To date, it is thought to be the best-fitting animal model analogous to anorexia nervosa.",

      "title": "Femoral Neck Stress Fracture Complicated by Deep Venous Thrombosis and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stress fractures occur when repeated forces on a bone exceed its repair abilities. There are 3 situations in which stress fractures can arise: when an abnormal load is placed on normal bone, when a normal load is placed on abnormal bone, or when an abnormal load is placed on abnormal bone. When a stress fracture occurs in a female athlete, one needs to be suspicious of the female athlete triad: low bone density (osteopenia and osteoporosis), disordered eating, and menstrual dysfunction. The female athlete triad occurs when pressure to perform and maintain a low body mass leads to increased training and decreased caloric intake. Stress hormones produce hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction and menstrual irregularities. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea leads to decreased estrogen production, which causes decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, and increased risk of stress fractures [1]. When stress fractures occur, they can normally be treated nonoperatively with relative rest and slow, pain-free return to activity. This process typically takes 3-18 weeks. Bone growth stimulators, which use either an electrical current or ultrasound, can facilitate bone healing. Possible complications secondary to stress fractures include delayed union, nonunion, avascular necrosis, and progression to complete fracture. To heal a stress fracture, patients must limit their activity. Because most patients with a stress fracture are not placed on strict bed rest or hospitalized, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is generally not indicated. Patients with Virchow triad of venous stasis, vessel wall injury, and hypercoagulable state are at greater risk for DVT formation. Other risk factors for DVT include advanced age, cancer, history of previous clots, and use of oral contraceptives or estrogens. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) can arise secondary to immobilization, a noxious event, neurological disease, or even after very minor injuries or microtrauma. CRPS is characterized by pain that is out of proportion to the injury, as well as allodynia and hyperalgesia. CRPS type 2 occurs after a nerve injury, whereas CRPS types 1 does not have an associated nerve injury. Physical examination findings of CRPS include edema, changes in skin blood flow, and abnormal sudomotor activity in the region of pain. Additional changes from CRPS include atrophy of skin and nails, changes in hair growth, and loss of function. The International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a set of 4 criteria for the diagnosis of CRPS type 1: the presence of a noxious event or immobilization; continued pain, allodynia, or hyperalgesia disproportionate to the event; evidence at sometime of edema, changes in skin blood flow, or abnormal sudomotor activity in the area of pain; and the diagnosis is excluded by the presence of another condition that would account for the symptoms. The pathogenesis of CRPS remains unclear. It is hypothesized that CRPS is sympathetically mediated pain. This is supported by trend that patients often improve with sympatholytic procedures. A stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS is an unusual clinical presentation. To the authors' knowledge, this constellation of conditions has not been reported in the literature. This report details a female athlete with a femoral stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS. The patient is a 37-year-old female triathlete with osteopenia and a T score of −2.2 standard deviations in the left femoral neck who is being treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Secondary amenorrhea of several years duration was recently treated with oral contraceptives. Her body mass index was 20.1, and she had clinical depression. The patient is very active, running 12 miles per week, biking 30 miles per week, and swimming. While doing sprints, she felt a \"pop\" and developed acute onset of severe left hip pain. Radiographs obtained showed abnormal sclerosis of the femoral neck (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an incomplete fracture line from the medial cortex (compression side) to the femoral neck measuring 1 cm with adjacent periosteal edema (Figure 2). She was given crutches and instructed to remain non–weight bearing on the left lower extremity. Plain radiograph shows mild sclerosis throughout the femoral neck (arrows). Magnetic resonance imaging of the left hip without contrast performed at the onset of pain shows bone marrow edema in the left femoral neck extending to the medial cortex. There is also an incomplete fracture line measuring 1 cm that extends from the medial cortex to the femoral neck. Three days after initiation of the non-weight bearing status, the patient developed left lower extremity edema. A Doppler ultrasound study showed a DVT and the patient was started on anticoagulation. The patient was also treated with a bone stimulator to accelerate bone healing and electrical stimulation to the muscles in her left lower extremity to maintain muscle bulk. The patient returned to clinic for follow-up 6 weeks later. At this time, her left lower extremity from the knee to her foot felt cool and her left foot had a purplish discoloration. The patient reported being compliant with her home exercise program of isometric muscle contractions. Venous and arterial Doppler Studies were repeated and showed resolution of the DVT. MRI repeated to monitor for bone healing and exclude another condition that could be the cause of the new leg symptoms showed an incompletely healed left medial side femoral neck stress fracture. The patient was diagnosed with CRPS type I based on the criteria established by the International Association for the Study of Pain. The patient was instructed on desensitization techniques and prescribed gabapentin and nortriptyline. After transitioning off of warfarin, the patient received a series of 3 lumbar sympathetic plexus blocks. After a third injection, she reported experiencing less discomfort and the color and temperature of her foot had started to normalize. MRI performed 4 months after the diagnosis of the stress fracture showed healing with minimal fracture line and subcortical edema. The patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months secondary to pain and incomplete bone healing. This patient has the female athlete triad consisting of osteopenia, menstrual irregularities, and disordered eating. Before the stress fracture, the patient had been evaluated and treated by an endocrinologist. Her work up included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, which was completed 4 months before the fracture and showed a T score of −2.2 standard deviations. Her vitamin D level was checked 4 months before the fracture; this was found to be within normal limits. The patient was instructed to take calcium 1500 mg per day and vitamin D supplementation as well as oral contraceptives; however, she was not given a bisphosphonate medication secondary to the desire to become pregnant in the near future. Although she was being treated for her osteopenia and amenorrhea, the patient sustained a stress fracture after intensive training for a triathlon. This case stresses the importance of treating osteopenia and the female athlete triad with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. The treatment of a stress fracture varies based on its location. Compression side femoral neck stress fractures, like in this patient, are generally treated nonsurgically. On the contrary, tension side stress fractures may require surgical pinning. The patient was prescribed a bone stimulator to aide bone healing as these have been suggested to be effective and safe for healing fractures and non-unions in animal and human studies [2, 3]. The patient was also prescribed electrical stimulation to her left leg muscles to help maintain muscle bulk while her activity was limited by weight bearing restrictions. This patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months while awaiting resolution of her pain and healing of the fracture. This is an unusually long time; most stress fractures will heal in 3-18 weeks. The patient received surgical evaluation for possible pinning in week 11 of her course. She was not a surgical candidate secondary to the numerous complications that had arisen and the fact that her repeat MRIs continued to show improvement. The development of a DVT in an outpatient after 3 days of non–weight bearing is unusual. There are reports in the literature of DVT formation after lower extremity fractures including hip [4] and ankle fracture [5], but, no other reported cases in the literature of DVT formation after treatment of a stress fracture in the outpatient setting could be identified. A hypercoagulable workup did not reveal any factor or genetic abnormality that could account for the formation of a DVT. Despite the occurrence of a DVT, the patient continued to take oral contraceptives. The patient developed CRPS type I after femoral neck stress fracture, non–weight bearing, and DVT formation. There are reports of CRPS after minor lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries including ankle sprains and stress fractures of the foot [6]. Although the exact mechanism of why CRPS occurs is unclear, in this patient, DVT, protected weight bearing, and femoral neck stress fracture were sufficient insults to produce temperature changes, color changes, and pain in the distal lower extremity, typical of CRPS. Normally, early, active mobilization of the affected area is recommended treatment for CRPS. However, in this situation, weight bearing and exercise of the left lower extremity was limited by a healing stress fracture. It was challenging to find a balance between treating the stress fracture, the CRPS, and DVT. Physical therapy, isometric exercises, desensitization techniques, electrical stimulation of the leg muscles, and medications were of limited efficacy in treating this patient's CRPS. As a compromise, the authors advised her in toe-touch weight bearing precautions to help treat the CRPS while still allowing the stress fracture to heal. The patient also responded positively to sympathetic blocks. The development of a DVT after stress fracture is rare. DVT prophylaxis is likely not indicated for patients with stress fractures. However, clinicians should have an index of suspicion for DVTs in a patient who is non–weight bearing while healing a stress fracture, especially when he or she has risk factors for DVT formation. In addition, recognition and subsequent treatment of the female athlete triad can help to prevent stress fractures from occurring. Finally, sympathetic blocks are an effective treatment modality for patients with CRPS secondary to femoral neck stress fracture and DVT, a situation in which weight bearing and mobilization are contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "【With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

The patient refers that two people inhabit her body, talk to each other, exchange opinions and both have control over the body, one giving the turn to the other depending on the circumstances. To this is added delusional symptoms of grandeur and sensorial-perceptual symptoms. In turn, depressive symptoms have appeared that have led the patient to have several suicide attempts throughout the follow-up time. Methods During this time, the patient has required hospital admission on two occasions due to the autolytic ideation. Treatment with neuroleptics and antidepressants has been established that have helped control delusions and thoughts of death, but not the dissociative clinic. Results Dissociative Identity disorder 300.14 (F44.81) Conclusions The different symptoms presented by the patient, as well as the social and occupational deterioration that he presents, make this an extremely complicated case, both in diagnosis and in treatment.

      "title": "Effective Treatment Approaches for Eating Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Review Article",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses marked by disordered behaviors toward food and eating due to dissatisfactory body shape and weight, which impact the physical and psychological growth of children and adolescents. This review aims to recognize the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in treating eating disorders. The most common type of eating disorder is anorexia nervosa characterized by severe restriction of energy intake and an intense fear of gaining weight. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of binging and purging followed by compensatory behaviors. Binge eating disorder is characterized by binging without compensatory behaviors. Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is characterized by a lack of interest in eating unrelated to weight and shape concerns. Depending on the severity of the condition, patients could be treated as an inpatient, partial hospitalization, or outpatient treatment using different psychotherapies, including family-based therapy, psychodynamic individual treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, adolescent-focused therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. Studies in children and adolescents show that family-based therapy is considered the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa, and the second evidence-based approach is adolescent-focused therapy. As for bulimia nervosa, both family-based treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy are almost equally effective. In binge eating disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are the most beneficial psychotherapies. For avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, psychotherapy or hospitalization could be considered. Concerning pharmacotherapy, none of the medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children and adolescents.",

Weight loss may result from decreased caloric intake, increased metabolism, or urinary or fecal loss of calories. A variety of general medical, gastrointestinal (GI), and behavioral illnesses produce unexplained weight loss. Depression is the most common behavioral disorder that decreases food intake and is characterized by mood changes, sleep disruption, anhedonia, and low self-esteem. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are distinguished by the patient's desire to maintain thinness and an altered body image. Specific therapies are available for many organic diseases that cause weight loss.

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "The psychological states of hunger and satiety play an important role in regulating human food intake. Several lines of evidence suggest that these states rely upon declarative learning and memory processes, which are based primarily in the medial temporal lobes (MTL). The MTL, and particularly the hippocampus, is unusual in that it is especially vulnerable to insult. Consequently, we examine here the impact on hunger and satiety of conditions that: (1) are central to ingestive behaviour and where there is evidence of MTL pathology (i.e., habitual consumption of a Western-style diet, obesity, and anorexia nervosa); and (2) where there is overwhelming evidence of MTL pathology, but where ingestive behaviour is not thought central (i.e., temporal lobe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder). While for some of these conditions the evidence base is currently limited, the general conclusion is that MTL impairment is linked, sometimes strongly, to dysfunctional hunger and satiety. This focus on the MTL, and declarative learning and memory processes, has implications for the development of alternative treatment approaches for the regulation of appetite.",

Some cases of depression(8) were misdiagnosed as suffering from dementia; the impaired powers of concentration and attention found in depression presumably giving a false impression of impaired memory and of dementia. 2. The reverse mistake was much less common (2 in this series) and one can conclude that only a minority of cases (2 of 15 in this series) of cerebral arteriosclerosis will present without signs of focal neurological damage. 3. The presence or absence of peripheral or retinal arteriosclerosis had no bearing on the state of the cerebral vessels. 4. The small differences between the psychologist's and physician's assessment of dementia is probably of no significance particularly as the psychologists used many tests (e. g., Goldstein's) that are no longer in general use.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Periodic paralysis is a rare neuromuscular disorder, related to a defect in muscle ion channels, characterized by episodes of painless muscle weakness, which may be precipitated by heavy exercise, fasting, or high-carbohydrate meals. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis may be familial (primary) or secondary. Here, we report three cases of secondary causes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. On evaluation, case 1 had distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to Sjogren's syndrome, case 2 had drug induced proximal RTA (Fanconi's syndrome) and case 3 had thyrotoxicosis. Clinician must be aware of causes of secondary PP as recognition and diagnosis can completely prevent further attacks of periodic paralysis. Each of the above case is rare, but completely treatable if diagnosed. Low dose steroids with bicarbonate replacement in case 1, stopping tenofovir in case 2 and carbimazole therapy in case 3 prevented further attacks of periodic paralysis and cardiopulmonary complications.",

According to this theory, the seizures and other manifestations of this disease are due to the formation and periodic accumulation of poisonous products of metabolism. This theory gains plausibility from the well-known fact that there are many substances which, if introduced into the circulation of an animal either by ingestion through the alimentary tract or by hypodermic injection, can cause epileptiform seizures, and that some of these substances are analogous or even identical in composition with some of the products which are constantly formed in the animal organism in the course of normal metabolic changes. Further corroboration of this theory is found in the fact that disorders of the excretory organs, especially of the kidneys, such as bring about a retention of excretory substances, frequently give rise to epileptiform convulsions.

Especially, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently showed a disturbance of the sleep-wake circadian rhythm, on the other hand, dementia with Lewy bodies showed REM sleep behavior disorder. This disturbance of circadian rhythm is associated with degeneration of responsible area for sleep-wake regulation (i.e. suprachiasmatic nucleus: SCN, tuberomammillary nucleus: TMN etc.) and decreased melatonin secretion. To prevent or treat sleep disturbance in dementia, mixed modality approach with pharmacological, physical and social intervention and sleep-wake scheduling is needed.

      "abstract": "This scientific commentary refers to ‘Enhanced habit formation in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome’, by Delorme et al. (doi:10.1093/brain/awv307). \n\nTourette syndrome is characterized by the presence of tics, which have a fluctuating, waxing and waning course, and are typically exacerbated by stress, anxiety, excitement, anger or fatigue. Tics are known to diminish when an individual is absorbed in an activity, concentrating, focused or pleased. Studies have also shown that tics can occur during sleep, although understandably patients fail to report their presence. Further, many individuals with tics, especially older children and adults, describe a sensory phenomenon (premonitory urge), such as a tension, impulse, tingle, or feeling located in the relevant body part, prior to the tic. Although it has been suggested that tics should be considered a habitual disorder (Singer, 2013), the presence of a premonitory urge, and its reduction by the performance of tics, may lead some to consider tics to be a goal-directed, rather than habitual behaviour. Moreover, it is unclear whether the occurrence of tics in all stages of sleep should modify their acceptance as a habit-based disorder.\n\nIn this issue of Brain , Delorme and co-workers explore the strength of habit formation and its underlying structural connectivity in medicated and unmedicated subjects with Tourette syndrome (Delorme et al. , 2016). In order to study human goal-directed and habitual behaviours in the laboratory, investigators have developed instrumental learning paradigms, which test the flexibility of the individual to adjust their behaviour to changes in outcome values. The paradigm used by Delorme et al. has been utilized in previous studies, and is considered sufficiently sensitive. The data obtained indicate that unmedicated subjects with Tourette syndrome have a greater reliance on habitual control systems than either healthy controls or medicated subjects. Several concerns, however, pertain to a lack …",

The cognitive or intellectual system, namely dementia, is one of the body systems that experience decline. Dementia is a condition of progressive intellectual decline that affects cognitive and functional abilities. Dementia has a detrimental effect on the elderly if not treated immediately, including changes in the patient's behavior such as forgetting who he is, and the elderly who wander alone to a location are likely to get lost because they do not remember the direction home. The brains of older adults with dementia are found to be damaged, with cell death and loss of blood supply to the brain. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of senility in the elderly at Rojinhome Ikadaen, Okinawa. The magnitude of senility in the elderly in fulfilling daily activities was described using quantitative and descriptive methods in this study. Most of the older women (75-90 years old) had a history of hypertension, and most had moderate dementia. The elderly are required to be able to perform regular physical activities, ranging from low-intensity activities such as meeting daily needs to moderate-intensity activities such as participating in the orphanage gymnastics program to improve cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that crime is a social phenomenon, we consider necessary to analyze it as an individual action committed by a real person in an actual circumstance. We mention that crime is a human action, determined by certain psychological elements, necessities, reasons, purposes. In Romania, the evolution of the crime phenomenon is a consequence of the impact of severe socio-economic issues, characteristic of the transition period, as well as of the authority crisis transited by the competent state institutions. The defective legislation and the overburdening of the criminal justice system, associated with the lack of staff and logistics, have limited the effect of preventive and repressive measures. Therefore, people who consume substances submitted for national inspection are called drug addicts or drug abusers. According to the World Health Organization, narcomania is “the state of constant or chronic intoxication, harmful for the individual and for society, caused by the repeated consumption of a certain drug (natural or artificial) – &lt;em&gt;it is characterized by the following&lt;/em&gt; – an irresistible need to continue consuming it and acquiring it by all means, a tendency to increase its dosage and a psychical, sometimes physical addiction for the effects of the drug”. Drugs of all types have been considered “magic” pills the molecular structure of which is well known by chemists, physicians and pharmacists. In literature they are also called “millenary fragile molecules”, which from ancient times were “glorified”, but in fact they do not have supernatural powers, but deceive people, being in fact a “two-faced coin”. The first face is the one which creates appeal and the second is the one which creates addiction, making us change our behavior and avoid our family and lose our friends. Thus we can state that one of the highest challenges of humanity is represented by drug consumption. The multiple environmental changes and the set of social, economic, and psychological changes are aspects which negatively influence people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;As a general conclusion, we can state that presently, illicit drug trafficking and consumption is the most successful business. The illicit drug market is considered the most “dynamic” crime market. Regarding the facts previously mentioned, we want to show that the citizens of the European Union spend over 24 billion lei a year on drugs.",

Considering the comorbidity between ED and anxiety disorders most of the research have shown that ED patients have higher rates of anxiety disorders than normal controls. It is interesting that more than two thirds of the patient report that the onset of the anxiety disorder to precede the onset of the ED. Food restriction can reduce anxiety by creating a feeling of achievement and self-control. Also it distracts the individual from other perfectionistic goals that are more difficult to achieve. On the other hand, binge eating can be used as a way of reducing unpleasant emotions and especially anxiety. It is probable that ED and anxiety disorders share common etiological factors, and that these factors can increase an individual’s susceptibility to either disorder. Furthermore, food restriction and binge eating seem to have some kind of “anxiolytic” biological and psychological effect and thus can be regarded as a reinforced self-healing behavior for patients that have been suffering from severe anxiety prior to the onset of ED.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

Most have daily headaches, including chronic migraine, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or other primary headaches. This brief review addresses, in broad strokes, some thoughts about alternatives beyond the usual daily oral preventive therapies. Do not proceed to more invasive or elaborate approaches until the big 3 are done: diagnosis is established, onabotulinumtoxinA administered when appropriate, that is, if the patient has chronic migraine, and wean is accomplished if the patient has medication overuse headache. Large numbers of patients are helped without the need for more arcane and unproven treatments by following these initial approaches. Simple nerve blocks can be useful in the initial steps, but more invasive blocks and stimulators are not recommended until the big 3 are completed. Wean of overused medications must be absolute and may require an intravenous bridge over several days, either in an infusion unit or inpatient in a medical model. Wean should be accompanied by establishing onabotulinumtoxinA or daily prevention from the beginning. Consider referral to a structured multidisciplinary headache program. This is for patients who require an interdisciplinary approach and may be day‐hospital or inpatient. Invasive blocks and stimulators may be appropriate, and the latter are currently being studied in controlled studies. The most promise, with the best balance of efficacy vs adverse event prospects, may be occipital nerve stimulators or sphenopalatine ganglion stimulators.",

Results: Eight patients were included in the presented case series. The average age of onset of this distinct headache condition is 57 years. All patients were either perimenopausal or in menopause when the headaches started. The syndrome is marked by bilateral head pain that starts daily from onset and is typically at its most severe intensity the first thing in the morning before arising or when in the supine position. Immediate worsening in Trendelenburg appears to be an almost diagnostic test for the syndrome and occurred in all patients. The majority of the patients had a history of episodic migraine, but the migraines were either very well controlled or had ceased by the time the new headache arose. The bulk of the patients (6/8) were either overweight or obese, although two patients were of normal body mass index (BMI). Neuroimaging showed no abnormalities. All patients responded to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure-/volume-lowering medications (acetazolamide or spironolactone), but only one patient was able to completely taper off treatment without headache recurrence. Conclusion: This newly defined subtype of chronic daily headache appears to be caused by a state of elevated CSF pressure. It is hypothesized that a combination of an elevated BMI and the presence of cerebral venous insufficiency leads to this form of daily headache.",

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

There are two fundamental aspects of life that are all too often ignored but have more recently received attention in high-performance sport – sleep and circadian biology. The impact of sleep on cognitive function and mood state could impact the ability to seamlessly coordinate all of the elements included in a skating performance and also increase the risk of injury. One way to counter the adverse effects of sleep restriction is to get additional sleep – either through sleep extension or by adding naps during the day. There is evidence that the symptoms of jet lag can have a negative impact on mental and physical performance.

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

      "abstract": "The proposed hypothesis posits that the major driving force of human decisions and actions are hedonistic such as pleasure seeking and discomfort avoiding located in the neuronal reward centers such as the nucleus accumbens. This drive is evaluated and controlled by “will power” or “self control” to avoid negative consequences with its neuronal basis in the prefrontal cortex. Both traits are secondarily influenced by memories of previous experiences as well as risk taking assessments originating mostly in the hippocampus and amygdala. In a healthy individual, these traits interact productively and to the well being of the individual. In addiction, however, these four traits are either overly active or overly inactive and their interactions become dysfunctional leading to addictive behavior. Here, it is posited that an overly active or poorly satisfied reward system is not fulfilled by natural stimuli but requires artificial stimuli like psychoactive drugs to achieve full satisfaction. This additional desire is secondarily poorly controlled by a weak or dysfunctional control system allowing the reward centers to become dominant and to force the individual to abuse drugs. Additionally, previous experiences and their memories and risk taking assessments do negatively affect the first two traits further strengthening the reward and weakening the control systems. It is further posited to assess the strength of each of the four traits as obtained from interviews, psychometric tests or physical measures. This could be done in that the strength or activity of each trait receives a number ranging from 0 to 10 like it is done in a pain scale. The sum of all four trait numbers will provide a semi-quantitative measure if an individual is or is not at risk of developing an addiction or about the major contributing factor or factors of an existing addiction. Assessment of the strength and activity of each of these four traits and their contributions to addictive behaviors will help the therapist to devise a more specific treatment plan to treat the main components leading to or maintaining an addiction or to prevent relapses after abstinence.",

Stress is the disturbance of the complex dynamic equilibrium that all organisms must maintain, and is associated with activation of the Stress system comprising of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the arousal/sympathetic nervous systems. The stress system functions in a baseline circadian fashion and interacts with other systems of the organism to regulate a variety of behavioral, endocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular functions. The experience of perceived or real uncontrollable intense and/or chronic stress (distress) may lead to several psychopathologic conditions, including anxiety, depressive and psychosomatic disorders, substance abuse, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, as well as impaired reproductive and immune functions. Developing children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress. Both behavioral and biological pathways are involved in the connection between chronic stress and obesity in adults and children. Emotional \"comfort\" eating, lack of sleep, impulsive behaviours and selection of specific foods often characterize stressed individuals. In addition to specific behaviours, dysregulation of the stress system through increased secretion of cortisol and catecholamines, especially in the evening hours, and in concert with concurrently elevated insulin concentrations, leads to development of central obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In children, chronic alterations in cortisol secretion may have additional effects on cognitive and emotional development, timing of puberty and final stature. Obese children and adolescents are frequently entangled in a vicious cycle between distress, impairing self-image and distorted self-image, maintaining and worsening distress.",

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients.

This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders.

      "abstract": "In the early premature, the EEG is mostly discontinuous. Discontinuity becomes limited to quiet sleep periods by the 36th week of conceptional age (CA). Temporal theta bursts, or the \"sawtooth\" pattern, come and go between 27 and 32 weeks' CA. Delta brushes attain their maximum about 32 to 34 weeks' CA and disappear about 40 to 44 weeks' CA. Frontal sharp transients have their peak occurrence at 35 or 36 weeks' CA and are still present at 44 to 48 weeks' CA. The background activity is essentially symmetric but transient patterns are less symmetric and frequently asynchronous. Lack of variability in the record is abnormal after 34 weeks' CA. Responses to isolated light flashes are prominent from very early prematurity through full-term. On the other hand, photic driving is frequent in early prematures (29-32 weeks' CA), but it then declines and is difficult to detect in the full-term neonate. Nonspecific responses to stimulation occur from early prematurity. Sleep--waking cycles are clearly discernible about 37 weeks' CA. Active sleep (rapid eye movement) goes from 60% at 34 weeks' CA to the 25% of adulthood at about 8 months of age. The EEG of the full-term newborn has four patterns, corresponding to three states: the low voltage irregular for wakefulness, high voltage slow and tracé alternant for quiet sleep, and the mixed for either wakefulness or active sleep.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Excluding pain directly originating from the abdominal wall, which has somatic characteristics, abdominal pain in cancer is due predominantly to a visceral involvement. Visceral cancer pain originates from a primary or metastatic lesion involving the abdominal or pelvic viscera. In a survey on prevalence, causes, and mechanisms of pain in advanced cancer patients followed at home, abdominal pain was found to have an incidence of 45%. Two-thirds of patients presented a visceral pain, although mixed pain syndromes were observed in more than half of these patients (1). The viscera have a complex peripheral nervous system and different neurophysiological understandings of visceral pain have been reported. Unlike their cutaneous counterparts, visceral nociceptors appear not to be a simple acute warning system. Many viscera are innervated by receptors that do not evoke conscious perception. Visceral nociceptors, how- ever, have a wide range of response, and may be activated in the presence of inflammation or tissue injury. Therefore, visceral afferents are considered polymodal, giving excitatory responses to different stimuli, including inflammation, stretching, and distension (2).",

Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

Acute responses to daily stressors can differ widely among individuals experiencing the same stressor, and these physiological responses may not align with stress appraisals. This review highlights individual and dyadic factors that may heighten and prolong stress reactivity, along with their implications for health. We discuss depression, rumination, early life adversity, and social evaluation as individual-level factors and interpersonal stress processes and relationship quality as dyadic-level factors that may influence physiological stress responses. Heightened and prolonged stress reactivity can provide a gateway to the physiological dysregulation that underlies depression and chronic disease, which themselves alter stress reactivity—a vicious cycle. Interventions that may dampen physiological stress reactivity include yoga, meditation, health behaviors (diet, exercise, and sleep), and cognitive behavior therapy.",

The symptoms of ASD often include language regression, motor regression, and loss of bowel and bladder use. ASD also affects the feeding habit of children, with rates up to 74% as compared to normally developing children. Among different problems related to feeding, food selectivity is one of the key problems as it is directly linked with inadequate nutrition. Different factors affecting food selectivity are restrictive and repetitive behaviors, sensory modulation disorder, sensory over responsively, frequent illness /physical discomfort, and family preferences of food. Food selectivity among the children with ASD has been reported to be as high as 46- 89% as compared to typically developing children. Enough research on linkage of food selectivity with age and other factors is yet to be confirmed. Knowledge and awareness in parents regarding autism and food selectivity may help immensely to diagnose and address feeding problems in ASD at early stage.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists see sleepy patients but often have limited facilities to investigate them. This article provides an update on the conditions causing sleepiness and describes how to investigate and manage sleepy patients.\n\nThe obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is the most common medical cause of sleepiness. It can present at any age but is most common in middle age, when it occurs in around 1–4% of men and 1–2% of women. It occurs rarely in the teens and 20s—a useful differentiator from narcolepsy. Patients usually present with sleepiness which is sometimes irresistible, but often causes difficulty with concentration and work performance rather than sleep attacks. Patients typically find sleepiness most troublesome in monotonous situations such as driving on motorways, reading, and watching television. OSAHS patients usually feel their sleep is undisturbed but do not feel refreshed in the morning. Their partners report loud snoring, apnoeas, and restless sleep. Two thirds of OSAHS patients are men and 50% are obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m2). Retrognathia plays a significant role, particularly in the non-obese.\n\nOSAHS is caused by the throat becoming critically narrow during sleep. Pharyngeal patency is usually achieved by the phasic contraction of upper airway dilating muscles during each inspiration, thus resisting sucking the throat shut as air is sucked in. There is no evidence of upper airway muscle dysfunction in OSAHS, rather the abnormality is anatomical—patients have narrower pharynxes than the normal population when awake. Thus, the physiological relaxation of the palatal and tongue muscles during sleep results in pathological throat narrowing. The patient then struggles to overcome the obstruction until aroused by negative intrathoracic pressure. The brief arousal reactivates the upper airway dilating muscles, and a few unobstructed breaths are taken before sleep resumes and apnoea recurs. This cycle of apnoea, arousal, apnoea, arousal may recur many hundreds …",

      "title": "Reflex seizures in Rett syndrome",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Reflex seizures are a rare phenomenon among epileptic patients, in which an epileptic discharge is triggered by various kinds of stimuli (visual, auditory, tactile or gustatory). Epilepsy is common in Rett syndrome patients (up to 70%), but to the authors' knowledge, no pressure or eating‐triggered seizures have yet been reported in Rett children. We describe three epileptic Rett patients with reflex seizures, triggered by food intake or proprioception. One patient with congenital Rett Sd. developed infantile epileptic spasms at around seven months and two patients with classic Rett Sd. presented with generalised tonic‐clonic seizures at around five years. Reflex seizures appeared when the patients were teenagers. The congenital‐Rett patient presented eating‐triggered seizures at the beginning of almost every meal, demonstrated by EEG recording. Both classic Rett patients showed self‐provoked pressure ‐triggered attacks, influenced by stress or excitement. Non‐triggered seizures were controlled with carbamazepine or valproate, but reflex seizures did not respond to antiepileptic drugs. Risperidone partially improved self‐provoked seizures. When reflex seizures are suspected, reproducing the trigger during EEG recording is fundamental; however, self‐provoked seizures depend largely on the patient's will. Optimal therapy (though not always possible) consists of avoiding the trigger. Stress modifiers such as risperidone may help control self‐provoked seizures.",

According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, primary insomnia is a syndrome mainly composed of psychophysiological insomnia, paradoxical insomnia and idiopathic insomnia. Primary insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep (mid-sleep awakening, early morning awakening) or chronic non restorative sleep, which persist longer than three weeks despite having adequate opportunity for sleep and result in impaired daytime functioning. Primary insomnia is not explained by currently known psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, substance use disorders. Primary insomnia is a non-organic, unknown etiology, middle-aged female predominant sleep disturbance. Recent findings suggest the hyperarousal hypothesis of primary insomnia.

      "title": "Jet lag: current and potential therapies.",
      "abstract": "Jet lag, also known as circadian desynchrony, is a sleep disorder in which there is a mismatch with the body’s natural circadian rhythm and the external environment as a result of rapid travel across multiple time zones. This common problem affects all age groups but may have more pronounced effects on the elderly, whose recovery rate is more prolonged than that in young adults.1\r\n\r\nA multitude of factors, such as the number of time zones crossed and the direction and timing of flights, play a role in the severity of symptoms experienced by travelers. Individual variability accounts for the ability to adapt to a new time zone and the duration of the symptomatic period. Travelers usually experience symptoms after air travel across at least two time zones. Symptoms may include disturbed sleep, daytime fatigue, decreased ability to perform mental and physical tasks, reduced alertness, and headaches. Sleep disturbances typically last for a few days, but they can persist for as long as one week if the change in time zones is greater than eight hours. Eastward travel is associated with a longer duration of jet lag than westward travel. Although frequent desynchrony is a transient disorder, it carries the potential to lead to long-term consequences, as evidenced by epidemiological and animal studies.2,3 Sequelae have included cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and an increased risk of cancer, infertility, and heart disease. As the body’s internal circadian “clock” adapts to the new time zone, jet lag diminishes.\r\n\r\nStrategies to minimize the effects of jet lag include adjusting the sleep schedule according to the new location during the days preceding the trip. This approach may be helpful for travel that lasts for more than a week, but it does not appear useful for short-term trips. Both alcohol and caffeine can adversely affect quality of sleep when they are consumed a few hours before bedtime; caffeine intake should be planned to enhance daytime alertness. When passengers are traveling, they are advised to avoid alcohol, especially while they are being treated for jet lag.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include non-pharmacological therapy alone or non-pharmacological therapy combined with nutraceuticals or pharmacological therapy. A non-pharmacological approach, including adequate exercise, hydration, and appropriate timing of exposure to bright light, can aid in the adjustment to a new time zone. Nutraceuticals and pharmacological therapies include melatonin, melatonin receptor analogues (agonists), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, caffeine, diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl, McNeil; Aler-Dryl, Reese), and armodafinil (Nuvigil, Cephalon).\r\n\r\nA review of treatments and potential strategies follows.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13].

Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder.

      "abstract": "Abstract People die daily in the hospital. Mostly, they die because their illnesses were no longer treatable (natural death). Unfortunately, some people die an unnatural death, in particular, as the result of euthanasia. In contrast to the situation in most countries, in the Netherlands euthanasia is accepted by the courts under strict conditions. It can be very difficult for the legal authorities to establish whether a person has died from natural causes or from suicide, euthanasia, or murder. In addition to the pathologist and the lawyer, the toxicologist also has a number of problems in showing whether euthanasia has been carried out. These can consist of the following analytical problems: (a) interactions—the patients involved have frequently been receiving a large number of toxic and nontoxic drugs simultaneously; (b) identification—not all drugs administered are included in general screening procedures; (c) metabolites—a large number of metabolites may have accumulated toward the end of a long therapeutic regimen; and (d) determination—determination of quaternary muscle relaxants and their various metabolites, as well as other drugs, can be problematic. There are also toxicokinetic problems: because of poor kidney and liver function, low serum albumen, general malaise, and interactions between these factors and other drugs, the kinetics of a given drug can differ from normal. This makes it all the more difficult to determine whether the patient died from an accumulation of medication or from a so-called “euthanetic” drug mixture. The case report of a 79-year-old man who died as a result of either pneumonia or a high pentazocine blood concentration (2200 µg/L) is discussed as an example of these problems. Using a pharmacokinetic calculation, it can be shown that the patient died as the result of an overdose of pentazocine rather than as a result of normal medication.",

METHOD AND AIM: Through a review of the most salient literature on MD, this paper proposes an alternative classification of MD--the ‘Addiction to Body Image’ (ABI) model--using Griffiths (2005)addiction components model as the framework in which to define MD as an addiction.It is argued the addictive activity in MD is the maintaining of body image via a number of different activities such as bodybuilding, exercise,eating certain foods, taking specific drugs (e.g., anabolic steroids), shopping for certain foods, food supplements,and the use or purchase of physical exercise accessories). In the ABI model, the perception of the positive effects on the self-body image is accounted for as a critical aspect of the MD condition (rather than addiction to exercise or certain types of eating disorder).Based on empirical evidence to date, it is proposed that MD could be re-classified as an addiction due to the individual continuing to engage in maintenance behaviours that may cause long-term harm.",

      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common, chronic ailments that affect millions of adults on a daily basis. FGIDs are characterized by recurrent symptoms (ie, abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, constipation, or diarrhea) that indicate a dysfunctional GI tract despite that an organic reason for the symptom generation is not identified on diagnostic studies.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 40% of all gastroenterology clinic visits are for FGIDs,[1] and a recent survey of generalists and gastroenterologists found that nearly one third of their patient population had symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).[2] Many patients with IBS have dyspepsia; likewise, many patients with dyspepsia also have overlapping symptoms of IBS. These 2 groups of patients are similar in that symptoms are typically chronic in nature, may wax and wane, are aggravated by psychosocial stressors, and are often worsened by meals. In addition, both disorders are considered difficult to diagnose by many physicians and in the absence of warning signs or “red flags,” extensive testing is unlikely to be helpful. These similarities raise the issue of whether IBS and dyspepsia are just different manifestations of the same disorder or whether they represent distinct clinical entities. Elucidating this clinical dilemma is important because it may improve our ability to diagnose and treat these common disorders.\r\n\r\nAt present, the ROME II committee classifies IBS as a distinctly separate functional bowel disorder from dyspepsia.[3] IBS is characterized by lower abdominal pain or discomfort in association with disordered defecation (Table 1). Dyspepsia presents as recurrent upper abdominal pain or discomfort associated with symptoms of early satiety, fullness, bloating, and nausea (Table 2). Because upper GI function regularly affects lower GI tract function (ie, the gastro-colic reflex), and lower GI function routinely affects upper GI function (ie, constipation slows gastric emptying), it should not be surprising that these 2 areas are intimately linked.[4]\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nRome II Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome[3]",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

Ingestion can be divided into oral, pharyngeal and esophageal stages. The main categories of pathology encountered in our swallowing and dysphagia clinic are encephalopathies (including cerebral palsy), genetic disorders (including chromosomal aberrations), syndromes associated with swallowing difficulty (e.g. Rett, Dandy-Walker, DiGeorge), head injuries, brain tumors, developmental delay and the oral deprivation syndrome (e.g. due to prolonged tube feeding on a preterm infant). The behavioral expression of the many different pathologies falls into three categories: (1) resistance to accepting food orally; (2) lack of energy and endurance to do the 'work' of eating; and (3) oral-motor disabilities resulting in an inability to produce the necessary motor skills for ingestion. Expect expression and exacerbation of feeding problems during periods of most active growth, i.e. from birth to 2 years and during the adolescent growth spurt. Identify the source of the feeding problem. Establish its pathology and note the clinical manifestations. Determine if the problem has a strictly physiologic origin or whether it may be exacerbated by the feeding interaction between child and feeder.

      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists in adulthood. It is defined by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. ADHD is associated with many comorbidities, including eating disorders (EDs). In the last decade, studies have reported that ADHD is linked with binge EDs, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa. Many postulates have been proposed to explain the association: 1) impulsive behavior in ADHD patients leads to disordered eating behavior; 2) other psychologic comorbidities present in ADHD patients account for eating behavior; 3) poor eating habits and resulting nutritional deficiencies contribute to ADHD symptoms; and 4) other risk factors common to both ADHD and EDs contribute to the coincidence of both diseases. Additionally, sex differences become a significant issue in the discussion of EDs and ADHD because of the higher incidence of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa in females and the ability of females to mask the symptoms of ADHD. Interestingly, both EDs and ADHD rely on a common neural substrate, namely, dopaminergic signaling. Dopaminergic signaling is critical for motor activity and emotion, the latter enabling the former into a combined motivated movement like eating. This linkage aids in explaining the many comorbidities associated with ADHD. The interconnection of ADHD and EDs is discussed from both a historical perspective and the one based on the revealing nature of its comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating and by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to avoid weight gain (e.g., vomiting, misuse of laxatives and diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise). A number of medical complications related to weight loss and to purging as well as increased rates of depression and anxiety disorders and alcohol and substance abuse often accompany BN. The assessment of BN should include a careful interview concerning the person's eating patterns and attitudes toward weight and food. The authors discuss possible causes of BN, include biological, psychological, family, and sociocultural theories. The most effective treatments for BN appear to be cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and antidepressant medications.

Symptomatic cataplexy is rare, and the anatomical localization of the defect responsible for the syndrome is, to our knowledge, unknown.<sup>1</sup>It is also unusual to encounter cataplexy in the absence of narcolepsy. <h3>Report of a Case.—</h3> A 58-year-old man gave a six-year history of recurrent falls occurring about twice a month and usually precipitated by anger or laughter. He described the sudden onset of overwhelming weakness such that his legs gave way and he fell to the floor. Consciousness was preserved and the attacks lasted only a few minutes. There was no associated sleep disturbance. He had never been able to look fully either to left or right.",

      "abstract": "The ultimate supreme function of the body is mentation; the other portions of the body are subservient to it. Dysmentation is very common, highly distressing, and enormously expensive. All abnormalities in mentation are presumably associated with altered metabolism. Dysmetabolism causes dysmentation and vice versa. Altered cerebral metabolism is produced by primary or secondary cerebral disorders in the body, and by extracorporeal influences—abnormalities in diet, climate, social status, and numerous other environmental factors; there frequently is a polycyclic interplay of influences. Dysmentation is often found in many genetic disorders, hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism. There are indications that it also occurs frequently in many other endocrine and metabolic disorders, but data are inadequate. Many neurotransmitters have been described, including especially acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Abnormalities in the metabolism of one or more of these have been reported in various types of dysmentation. In mental depression and mania there are abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism, with lesser changes in serotonin. Certain observations have suggested abnormalities in serotonin metabolism in schizophrenia, but data remain inadequate. Hallucinations and other marked behavioral changes have accompanied altered serotonin metabolism and/or ingestion of serotonin-like compounds. Changes in acetylcholine levels have produced anger, rage, anxiety and other behavioral states. Sleep seems to be associated with increased serotonin and decreased catecholamine levels; insomnia accompanies the reverse. Learning and memory are influenced by the metabolism of protein, nucleotides, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals, and numerous other factors. The brain has richer contents of adenosine-3′,5′-phosphate, adenyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase than any other organ, but relatively little is known about the functions there of this nucleotide. As endocrinologists and metabolists, problems of dysmentation confront us as highly interesting, and probably richly rewarding areas for research, teaching and practice.",

      "title": "THE MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANCE IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "In the general population, presence of a mood disorder increases the odds of a substance use disorder.71 Substance use and abuse is common in psychiatric patients, and depressive syndromes are common in patients seeking treatment for substance abuse.1, 89 Aside from their common co-occurrence, there are at least three sets of reasons to focus on clinically when treating the combination of substance use and depression: Substances, through their acute and chronic effects, may worsen depression and contribute to treatment resistance. DSM-IV lists either substance-induced mood, anxiety, or sleep disorders as resulting from practically every class of addictive substances.2 Thus, substance use could either worsen or account entirely for a treatment-resistant depressive syndrome. Depression may worsen the severity of substance use, increasing its deleterious effects over time. It has been shown consistently that patients with both depression and substance use syndromes have a poorer prognosis along various domains of outcome. * In particular the combination of depression and substance abuse increases the risk of suicide.42, 51 Substance use disorder in a depressive patient may point the way to other, previously unappreciated psychopathologic conditions that may contribute to treatment resistance. In the general population, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders are more strongly associated with substance abuse than is depression.71 These have specific treatment indications, mood stabilizers and various nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety regimens, 55 which might improve outcome in previously treatment-resistant cases. For example, buspirone has been shown to improve outcome in alcoholics with generalized anxiety symptoms.40 Explosive irritable mood in substance abusers may benefit from mood stabilizers, even in the absence of clear-cut bipolar disorder.21, 22 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a well-established risk factor for substance abuse and also is associated with depression.9, 10, 11, 24, 35 Such patients might benefit from antidepressant agents with demonstrated efficacy against ADD, such as desipramine or bupropion.4, 8, 12 Alcohol and other substances may cause dementia syndromes with associated mood symptoms, 34 which would suggest further neurologic and medical evaluation. The development of recommendations for treatment-resistant depression in patients with substance abuse or dependence is complicated by three issues: (1) Two domains of outcome are involved—substance use symptoms and mood symptoms; (2) Diagnostic uncertainty surrounds depressive symptoms in the setting of ongoing substance use; and (3) There is a relative lack of empiric studies on treatment of depression in substance abusers. An empiric base is beginning to accumulate on the initial treatment of depression in substance abusers, and this is reviewed in this article. There are no systematic studies to date on treatment-resistant depression in these patients. Illustrative cases are presented from the authors' clinical experience that suggest general principles and directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

It presents itself as not being able to enjoy the things that one enjoyed before, decrease or increase in sleep, loss or increase in appetite, decrease in cognitive thinking level, indecision, and a state of constant sadness. Everyone is able to experience these symptoms at a certain time in their life or in their daily life. Depression can be seen in all periods, including young people, middle ages and advanced ages. However, in addition to these, the age range of 15-29 was determined as the most common age range. According to the researches, individuals with low socio-economic status have higher rates of depression compared to individuals with high socio-economic status, women compared to men and single people compared to married people. However, the person is diagnosed with depression depending on the duration, severity and diagnostic criteria of the depression. In order for a person to be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be observed for at least 2 weeks, at a level that disrupts the person's daily life and activities. In this case report, cognitive behavioral therapy school was used to regulate the treatment process of our 24-year-old, single male patient who presented with symptoms of depression and to reduce the existing symptoms.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Upper gastrointestinal disorders typically present with common symptoms. The most relevant non-mucosal diseases are gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia and rumination syndrome. The literature pertaining to these 3 conditions was reviewed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Gastroparesis is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach. The cardinal symptoms include postprandial fullness (early satiety), nausea, vomiting and bloating. The most frequently encountered causes of these symptoms are mechanical obstruction (pyloric stenosis), iatrogenic disease, gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, cyclical vomiting and rumination syndrome. The most common causes of gastroparesis are neuropathic disorders such as diabetes, idiopathic, post-vagotomy and scleroderma among myopathic disorders. Principles of management of gastroparesis include exclusion of mechanical obstruction with imaging and iatrogenic causes with careful medication and past surgical history. Prokinetics and anti-emetics are the mainstays of treatment. Functional dyspepsia is characterized by the same symptoms as gastroparesis; in addition to delayed gastric emptying, pathophysiological abnormalities include accelerated gastric emptying, impaired gastric accommodation and gastric or duodenal hypersensitivity to distension and nutrients. Novel treatments include tricyclic antidepressants in patients with normal gastric emptying, acotiamide (acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor) and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists such as buspirone. Rumination syndrome is characterized by repetitive regurgitation of gastric contents occurring within minutes after a meal. Episodes often persist for 1-2 h after the meal, and the regurgitant consists of partially digested food that is recognizable in its taste. Regurgitation is typically effortless or preceded by a sensation of belching. This has been summarized as a ‘meal in, meal out, day in, day out' behavior for weeks or months, differentiating rumination from gastroparesis. Patients often have a background of psychological disorder or a prior eating disorder. Treatment is based on behavioral modification. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Precise identification of the cause and pathophysiology of upper gastrointestinal symptoms is essential for optimal management.",

      "title": "Dizziness in diabetes",
      "abstract": "Humpty Dumpty was clear: ‘When I use a word… it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.’1 Did his doctors know what he meant? I didn't when my patient said she was mazy (dizzy or confused) and merligoes (vertigo) would have baffled me completely. Ask patients: ‘When you say “dizzy”, do you mean lightheaded like you might pass out, a spinning sensation like after a carnival ride, mental fogginess like you can't concentrate, or something else?‘4 ‘My sugars have been very high for some time… For the last several months I have found that I am unable to climb a flight of stairs… The other thing that is affecting me is my balance… my dsn confirmed my balance has been affected by nerve damage. It feels like I'm drunk when I'm stood up or walking… iam only 37 but honestly feel like a 90 year old.’5 In people with diabetes there are many possible reasons for dizziness, and one patient may have several. A few are discussed below. Dizziness was reported as a symptom of hypoglycaemia by 11–44% of people. It is thought to be due to neuroglycopenia rather than autonomic dysfunction.6 But the patient may have that too. Hyperglycaemia also causes dizziness. In one UK study of hyperglycaemic symptoms in people with insulin-treated diabetes, 26.9% felt light-headed, and 22.4% described dizziness.7 The hypovolaemia of dehydration may partly explain this but glucose is toxic in other ways. People with postural hypotension have an increased risk of falling. In the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, postural hypotension was also linked with a higher five-year, age-adjusted mortality than in those without postural drop. This effect diminished on multivariate analysis except in people with both diabetes and postural hypotension in whom the odds ratio was 2.28 (1.27–4.11) compared with people without diabetes.8 Among 204 people with diabetes, 28.4% had postural hypotension vs 22.5% of the 408 people without diabetes. Among people with diabetes with measurable postural hypotension only 32.8% reported postural dizziness. ‘Postural dizziness, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and plasma glycosylated hemoglobin levels were independently associated with postural hypotension in patients with diabetes.’9 Autonomic neuropathy causes postural hypotension. An American study found a drop of 20 mmHg after one minute of head-up tilt in 22.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes and in 16.2% of those with type 2 patients.10 Nowadays, I suspect the most common cause of postural hypotension is target-driven over-treatment of hypertension. When monitoring antihypertensive treatment, ask about falls and about postural dizziness (but remember that two-thirds of those with postural hypotension may be asymptomatic). Measure blood pressure lying/sitting and after standing for one minute. A drop of ≥20 mmHg is significant – review and, if necessary, reduce medication and measure blood pressure standing in future.11 In the US 2001–4 NHANES study, 35.4% of people ≥40 years old had vestibular dysfunction, the risk increasing with age. Diabetes also increased the risk – vestibular dysfunction was found in 53.6% of those with diabetes vs 33.2% of those without diabetes. In the 26.8% who had both symptomatic dizziness and vestibular dysfunction, the odds ratio for falling was 12.3 (7.9–16.7) compared with people with neither problem.12 Thirty-two people with diabetes and dizziness, loss of balance or falls were referred to a specialist balance disorders service. All but one had neuropathy. On detailed testing, 27 had substandard equilibrium scores among whom 25 had abnormal vestibular function including three with somatosensory (proprioceptive) problems. Two had only proprioceptive abnormalities.13 An electrophysiological study of vestibular function found abnormalities in over one-third of people with type 2 diabetes, linked to HbA1c.14 Studies of rats with diabetes found morphological abnormalities in their vestibular system.15 Vestibular function was assessed in 95 young people with type 1 diabetes aged 6–28 years. ‘Within the diabetic group 6 patients complained about vertigo and balance disorders. Spontaneous nystagmus occurred in 10 cases… Impaired optokinesis occurred in 36 cases and impaired eye tracking test in 33 cases. In caloric tests there was partial canal paresis in 4 cases and directional preponderance in 7 cases.’ There were few abnormalities among age-matched controls without diabetes. Among patients with a history of severe hypoglycaemia, 26.6% had spontaneous nystagmus compared with none of those without hypoglycaemic episodes.16 Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was found in 8% of individuals with moderate or severe dizziness or vertigo in a German study which showed a lifetime prevalence of BPPV of 2.4%, a one-year prevalence of 1.6% and a one-year incidence of 0.6%.17 Some studies suggest that people with diabetes are more at risk of BPPV than those without diabetes. Among people with type 2, 84% had ‘abnormal test performance on assessment of at least one vestibular end organ’.18 Among patients aged >18 years with a vestibular diagnosis for symptoms of dizziness, BPPV was found in 46% of people with diabetes vs 37% in those without diabetes. However, logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of hypertension mediated the higher frequency of BPPV in diabetes.19 BPPV is treatable, so seek expert advice if you suspect this diagnosis. Drugs designed to drop blood pressure can obviously cause dizziness (see above), as can those producing hypovolaemia such as diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors. Diabetes medications may cause dizziness from hypoglycaemia. Several antibiotics may produce dizziness including quinolones and fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin), macrolides (e.g. erythromycin), and especially aminoglycosides like gentamicin. Gentamicin can cause permanent ototoxicity with deafness and vertigo, especially in renal impairment – adjust the dose and monitor gentamicin levels according to manufacturers’ guidance. Antifungals including amphotericin B and fluconazole, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and neuropathic pain relievers (for example, amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin) can cause dizziness; and gabapentin causes vertigo.20, 21 This mitochondrial disorder inherited from affected mothers may affect some 1% of all people with diabetes. It is woefully under-diagnosed. In addition to diabetes and deafness, patients may suffer vestibular dysfunction with dizziness and unsteadiness. They are often thin with short stature, and may have myopathy, heart problems and renal disease.22 A man with a rare MIDD mutation had multiple tumours including acoustic neuroma. Such tumours are unusual but this is a reminder not to forget serious intracranial causes of dizziness such as vascular events or tumours.23 ‘You must tell DVLA if you suffer from dizziness that is sudden, disabling or recurrent.’24 Dizziness and vertigo are common and their effect on patients varies from a minor nuisance to serious disability. Patients use many words to describe dizziness. Clarify exactly what is meant. Dizzy people are more at risk of falls. Elucidate the cause(s) of the dizziness, remembering that people with diabetes have many reasons for this symptom and that one individual may combine several reasons. Potentially dangerous causes include hypoglycaemia and postural hypotension. Review medications – many drugs can cause dizziness. Remember BPPV in patients with vertigo – treatment is usually effective. Tell patients with sudden, disabling or recurrent dizziness or vertigo not to drive. Dizziness may be a vague symptom, but its impact for the patient is not. Find the cause and treat it.",

Although many persons with eating disorders may make a full recovery, some may not; this is especially the case when it comes to persons with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SEAN), namely, those who have had anorexia for between 6 and 12 years or more. Given that persons with SEAN are less likely to make a full recovery, a different treatment philosophy might be ethically warranted. One potential yet scarcely considered way to treat persons with SEAN is that of a harm reduction approach. A harm reduction philosophy is deemed widely defensible in certain contexts (e.g. in the substance use and addictions domain), and in this paper we argue that it may be similarly ethically defensible for treating persons with SEAN in some circumstances.",

This is true also within the domain of change through individual or small-unit action, here called \"discretionary change.\" The problem of irreversibility can be attacked through a dynamic theory, where \"dynamic\" means time-regarding. The key concepts used in the analysis are conditional growth, delayed response (or distributed lags), and feedback. Some of the more general consequences for sociological macroanalysis are discussed in the concluding sections of the paper.",

      "abstract": "In typical learners, reading is the basis of learning.Most of us learn to recognize letters prior to pre-school, and the majority of us learn to read single words and simple sentences in kindergarten and first grade.Evidence is not wholly conclusive as to what part of the brain we use to read.This can be attributed to many factors ranging from how the reader views the activity, such as work and a non-leisure activity versus an enjoyable activity, to biological factors that may make reading more difficult, and in effect less enjoyable for some children.There are also distractors to take into consideration that present to young readers such as technology and socialization.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition, Reading Disability is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder, within the more general category \"specific learning disorders,\" qualified by the description \"with impairment in reading\" [1].To be diagnosed with specific learning disorder, a person must have difficulties in at least one of the following areas, and the symptoms also must have continued for at least six months despite interventions: difficulty reading (e.g., inaccurate, slow and only with much effort); difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read; difficulty with spelling; difficulty with written expression (e.g., problems with grammar, punctuation or organization); difficulty understanding number concepts, number facts or calculation; or difficulty with mathematical reasoning (e.g., applying math concepts or solving math problems) [1].In 2015-16, the number of students ages 3-21 receiving special education services in the United States was 6.7 million, or 13 percent of all public school students.Among students receiving special education services, 34 percent had specific learning disabilities [2].The challenge presented to researchers and educators is to mesh the research-proven methods for reading with classroom practices.Although reading is a fundamental skill that is required throughout one's lifetime, many children lose interest in reading by a very young age.Perhaps the occurrence of this can be diminished by focusing on incorporating solid research into classroom practices of teaching reading.",

The discrepancies of the clinical findings themselves sometimes demand attention and benefit the patient when they lead to the identification of disturbances which could not at first be recognized. Selective indications, planned interrogation and thorough correlations with the clinical examinations and other findings are decisive for the value of the EEG in detail.",

Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

A failure to execute an intended action (e.g., take medication) at the appropriate juncture in future (e.g., after dinner) can negatively affect our daily functioning and at times, may have devastating effects (e.g., forgetting to turn off the gas stove before leaving the house). Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit widespread cognitive deficits including deficits in PM. The present study provides a meta-analytic review of PM in PD. Results across nine studies indicated time and event-based PM to be similarly impaired in PD, with time-based PM compromised to a slightly larger extent (Hedges’ g = −0.71) as compared to event-based PM (Hedges’ g = −0.55). The impairment in PM is more likely due to failure in self-initiated retrieval of intention to be executed, rather than forgetting the content of the intention itself. Furthermore, factors such as intervening task complexity and the mediating role of other executive functions have also been proposed to be responsible for impaired PM in PD.

This chapter discusses basic mechanisms, findings, and models that help our understanding of the interactions between eating and emotions, in both clinical and nonclinical populations. The finding that comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders is the norm among patients with EDs suggests that EDs may not necessarily be restricted to domains of eating behavior and body image but may also be associated with significant difficulties in affective functioning. This chapter reviews the evidence relating to the notion that EDs are disturbances of mood regulation, in which regulatory strategies specifically related to eating and the body are used to diminish negative affect associated with food, body image, or stress.",

      "title": "Invited Review: Developmental plasticity in respiratory control",
      "abstract": "Development of the mammalian respiratory control system begins early in gestation and does not achieve mature form until weeks or months after birth. A relatively long gestation and period of postnatal maturation allows for prolonged pre- and postnatal interactions with the environment, including experiences such as episodic or chronic hypoxia, hyperoxia, and drug or toxin exposures. Developmental plasticity occurs when such experiences, during critical periods of maturation, result in long-term alterations in the structure or function of the respiratory control neural network. A critical period is a time window during development devoted to structural and/or functional shaping of the neural systems subserving respiratory control. Experience during the critical period can disrupt and alter developmental trajectory, whereas the same experience before or after has little or no effect. One of the clearest examples to date is blunting of the adult ventilatory response to acute hypoxia challenge by early postnatal hyperoxia exposure in the newborn. Developmental plasticity in neural respiratory control development can occur at multiple sites during formation of brain stem neuronal networks and chemoafferent pathways, at multiple times during development, by multiple mechanisms. Past concepts of respiratory control system maturation as rigidly predetermined by a genetic blueprint have now yielded to a different view in which extremely complex interactions between genes, transcriptional factors, growth factors, and other gene products shape the respiratory control system, and experience plays a key role in guiding normal respiratory control development. Early-life experiences may also lead to maladaptive changes in respiratory control. Pathological conditions as well as normal phenotypic diversity in mature respiratory control may have their roots, at least in part, in developmental plasticity.",

It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task.

The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization. It a global expression of what an organization is. Organization climate manifestation of attitudes of organizational members towards the organizational itself. Motivation and behaviour of organizational members are significantly influenced by organizational climate.

In humans, it the general condition of a person in mind, body and spirit, usually meaning to being free from illness, injury or pain (as in good or healthy)the World Health Organization (who) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. although this definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as having a lack of operational value and the problem created by use of the word complete, it remains the most enduring.

      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a sudden and severe anterograde memory disturbance accompanied by various degrees of retrograde amnesia and sometimes executive dysfunction. TGA affects elderly individuals and men and women equally. During the episode, patients cannot recall novel episodic information and therefore repeatedly ask the same questions. They are not fully oriented to space and time. Diagnostic criteria first established in 1985, and elaborated in 1990, demand that there is no clouding of consciousness, other impairments of cognition, or a history of epilepsy or head trauma. An episode of TGA resolves within 24 h leaving a memory gap for the length of the attack. While in rare cases TGA might happen repeatedly, it mostly occurs as a single attack. TGA is considered a benign disorder as memory deficits resolve completely and do not lead to long-term sequelae. In up to 90% of reported TGA cases, a precipitating event - mainly described as physical or emotional stress - is present. The cause of TGA has been a matter of long-standing debate among researchers. In search of an answer, several possible causes (ischemia, migraine, epileptic seizures, or, more recently, a disturbance of venous hemodynamics) have been hypothesized. However, to date there is no scientific proof of any of these mechanisms. By using diffusion-weighted MRI 24-48 h after a TGA episode, small dot-like lesions have been detected in the hippocampus. This has led to the implication that the selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons to metabolic stress might play a role in the pathophysiology of TGA.",

Recently, reported cases of FDEIA have been increasing both in adults and children. FDEIA is the end condition depending on a summation process, and its pathogenetic mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Factors that add up their effects are food ingestion and physical effort and, in some cases, concomitant diseases, alcohol, drugs, emotional stress, menstruation, and particular weather conditions contribute to enhancing the reaction. Food-specific FDEIA (sFDEIA) implies the presence of an IgE-mediated sensitization to one or more foods, while in unspecific FDEIA (nsFDEIA), any food can induce anaphylaxis without sensitization. Among causative foods, the most dominant trigger of FDEIA is wheat, in particular the allergen ω-5 gliadin (Tri a 19). Other common foods are seafood, seeds, grains, nuts, vegetables and fruit, cow's milk, meat, and eggs. We present three cases of sFDEIA in children with clinical features and laboratory findings; the first was induced by a culprit food less frequently involved in sFDEIA than the others.",

Pessoas com esse transtorno tem um medo intenso de engordar, mesmo quando estao extremamente magras. 90% dos casos acontecem em mulheres entre 12 a 20 anos. Este trabalho tem como objetivo esclarecer caracteristicas, consequencias, padroes comportamentais e estrategias terapeuticas relacionados a Anorexia nervosa. Frequentemente, a perda de peso e conseguida atraves da reducao de ingestao alimentar ou de dietas restritivas. O uso de laxantes, diureticos e anorexigenos pode ocorrer acompanhado ou nao de exercicio fisico excessivo. Alem das mudancas comportamentais, podem ocorrer sintomas neurofisiologicos, tais como hipotermia, cefaleia, perda de interesse sexual, letargia, cabelos e unhas quebradicos, pele seca recoberta de pelugem, arritmia cardiaca, anemia, entre outros. O transtorno relaciona-se a auto-estima rebaixada; perfeccionismo; repertorio comportamental limitado; tendencia a auto-avaliacao a partir da opiniao dos outros; medo de mudancas; hipersensibilidade e gosto pela ordem; atribuicao de insucesso em diferentes areas de vida\r\nao corpo e nao discriminacao de limitacoes em termos de habilidades sociais. A analise comportamental desse transtorno depende de cada caso; deve-se fazer uma analise funcional a partir da queixa do cliente e tambem da familia. Geralmente, o desenvolvimento da anorexia relaciona-se a falta de habilidades sociais e reducao do repertorio comportamental e fontes de reforcamento. Esse processo pode ser acompanhado de pensamentos obsessivos e comportamentos compulsivos, o que contribui ainda mais no isolamento social. O tratamento da anorexia e multidisciplinar e pode se dar em ambulatorio ou em regime de internamento institucional. O tratamento medicamentoso ainda e controverso, embora alguns defendam o uso de antidepressivos. Os principais objetivos sao ganhar peso e voltar a comer. Possiveis estrategias terapeuticas relacionam-se ao monitoramento das refeicoes e pesagem semanal. Psicoterapia comportamental e fundamental para promover treino de habilidades sociais e autocontrole. Terapia familiar tambem pode ser recomendada, quando os padroes familiares de comunicacao estao disfuncionais.",

Although once recovered from acute symptoms by day 3, the patient suffered from long-term ventilator dependence (days 11–54), unresponsiveness, and quadriparesis. Despite no remarkable finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, or lumber puncture, a nerve conduction study showed reductions in the amplitudes and conduction velocities of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials in the limbs (Table 1). The patient recovered from all neurological symptoms within 2 years of exposure to DEG. Sensorimotor neuropathy from DEG poisoning can be delayed until at least 5–10 days post-ingestion and presents various symptoms including quadriparesis and unresponsiveness.2 The clinical course in severe cases is unpredictable, with long-term resolution in some patients and permanent neurological damage in others.2 In the management of such patients, subsequent close observation is required even after initial recovery. The patient received renal replacement therapy (RRT) for renal failure on day 1–30. Although RRT could be withdrawn in this case, one report showed 90.0% of dialysis-dependent patients from DEG poisoning remained so over time.3 Clinicians should recognize a possible necessity of long-term RRT for such cases. The report of this case was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine (2015-1-668). Conflict of Interest: None declared.",

      "title": "Cerebral reorganization after sensorimotor stroke",
      "abstract": "Stroke can interfere with every single capacity of the human brain. Many patients experience transient deficits that disappear within 24 hours (Hennerici et al., 1988) or suffer from slight or moderate hemiparesis that regresses completely within a couple of days (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992). Of the patients with severe completed stroke, approximately 50% recover from hemiparesis (Heinemann et al., 1987; Gresham et al., 1998). In most of these patients, recovery takes place within the first four weeks after infarction, usually starting with shoulder and synergistic arm–hand movements (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992; Katrak et al., 1998). In subcortical infarctions, functional restoration may be slower, continuing over several years (Fries et al., 1993; Manto et al., 1995). This suggests that a variety of mechanisms may be involved in the restoration of motor functions after brain infarction. Also, clinically undetected white matter changes and the prevalence of silent stroke lesions in patients presenting with the symptoms of acute stroke affect the cognitive and attention state of patients and their capacity to recover (Kase et al., 1989; Sultzer et al., 1995; van Zagten et al., 1996). Therefore, the challenging aspect in each stroke patient is the question to what degree he or she will recover. To monitor recovery, the importance of an adequate assessment of the functional deficit and of the disability level of daily activities has increasingly been recognized (Duncan et al., 2000), since correlation with the tissue perfusion state, the recruitment of peri-lesional and remote areas during functional activation, and changes of cortical excitability, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), will provide the basis for an evaluation of the recovery mechanisms and of the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions that have been or will be introduced into clinical use.",

      "title": "Daytime napping and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: Relevancy in Asian populations",
      "abstract": "In hot climates, such as the Middle East, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, it is common to discontinue strenuous physical activity at noon, when temperatures are highest, in favor of a midday nap, and resume work when the sun is lower, along with the temperature. This behavior is common to many species including the drosophila fly and may even have a biologic foundation.1 In affluent societies (frequently at higher altitudes), it is often thought that the daytime nap habit is a manifestation of laziness and inefficiency. In northern (usually affluent) and southern (sometimes poorer) societies, people may nap for different reasons, including fatigue, lack of sleep, or exhaustion in the former and the same reason and/or cultural habit in the latter. Since 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is now being broadly advocated, daytime sleep may distort the elegant distinction between the daytime and the lower nighttime BP, commonly dubbed “nocturnal BP dipping.” Ignoring it, as is frequently done, misrepresents some commonly used variables such as daytime BP, nighttime BP, and circadian variations. Some may look at this as semantics; however, it is clear that nocturnal BP and the reduction from daytime BP (dipping), as well as BP variability influenced by sleep (among other important factors), may be the most important variables from a prognostic point of view.2-5 At the individual level, daytime sleep when included in the daytime average BP, may artificially lower the value and minimize the day-night difference as well as the day/night ratio.6-8 Similarly, another behavioral pattern that may distort the circadian BP recording pattern is nocturnal awakening, be it for urination (as commonly happens in older individuals), for nursing (as happens when having babies to care for), or other reasons.9, 10 When awake measurements are included in the nighttime average, they may artificially elevate it. When both daytime napping and nighttime awake periods are present, the dipping (or night/day ratio) will be artificially changed and mask the physiological normal ability for circadian variation of BP.11 Some relevant research has used diaries for defining sleep and awake periods, and others have used an objective measure actigraphy with similar results. A recent attempt to compare diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography (the gold standard in evaluating sleep) found the agreement of self-report with polysomnography to be comparable to that of actigraphy.12 Beyond the individual level, both daytime napping13, 14 and nocturnal urination15, 16 have prognostic implications, particularly in the elderly and those with prevalent ischemic heart disease, that increases mortality. A meta-analysis of napping that evaluated 11 prospective studies involving 151 588 participants found that napping for 1 hour or more was associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Nocturia was also associated with increased mortality.15, 16 Possible explanations could include confounding such as silent atherosclerosis, age, employment, and ethnic origin. Another explanation may have a hemodynamic basis, as the rise of BP and to a lesser extent of heart rate after awakening, be it in the morning, daytime, or night, may explain the overall finding of the previously mentioned meta-aanalysis.17, 18 In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Hoshide and colleagues19 present a broad, relevant, and enlightening review in their article: “Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the management of hypertension in Asian populations.” Of course many important Asian populations including Indian, Thai, Indonesian, Philippine, and many others are not represented because there is an absence of relevant data. The authors discuss several important features specific to Asian (mostly Japanese and Chinese) populations: The authors downplay the role of daytime napping, suggesting that it is prevalent mostly in Asians of Chinese origin. Nevertheless, in the large JACC (Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk) study27 of patients free of cardiovascular disease, it was prevalent in 36% of men and 27% of women of the 67 129 participants. In addition, in this Japanese study, there was an increased association of daytime napping with adverse outcomes, as in the previously mentioned meta-analysis. Certainly the issue of nocturnal BP and the dip from daytime BP are close and competing predictors of adverse outcome. One of the common arguments against the importance of dipping is its poor reproducibility. This is probably true, but it should be noted that the dip is dependent on both daytime and nighttime BP, both of which may be easily distorted by misclassification associated with daytime napping and nocturnal awakenings or both. However, in 100 patients with repeated monitoring, the reproducibility of dipping as a categorical variable was only 66% 28 At the same time, reproducibility of BP category (normal vs elevated) was similar at 70%. When 35 of these patients whose 24-hour systolic BP changed significantly (by >10 mm Hg) between the two monitoring sessions, the correlation of first and second 24-hour average was nil, whereas that of the dip (as a continuous variable) was significant (r=.45, P<.01). It should be acknowledged that long before nocturnal BP could be assessed, Sir Horace Smirk had defined a state of the “basal BP” as measurements taken in patients at rest who were completely relaxed and in the supine position and found that those were better at characterizing the individual then what he called “casual BP.”29 By today's standards, Smirk's “basal BP” is probably analogous to sleep BP. He and his colleagues found more than 60 years ago that basal BP and not the casual one was a significant predictor of outcome.30 The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.",

      "abstract": "Clinical Causes, i. Increasedfunctional activity.2. Congenital tendency, e. g., giant growth of certain parts.3. Removal of pressure.The growth of certain structures is kept within bounds by the pressure of adjacent organs.We com- monly find increased thickness of the skull in cases where parts of the brain are absent.4. Direct stimulation, taking the form of intermittent pressure ; e. g., corns.Constant pressure leads to atrophy. 5. Disturbances of nutrition, (a) Direct disturbances (trophic) of innervation, as thickening of the skin in some nerve lesions.{b) Interference with the function of certain obscure organs, viz., the thyroid gland, the thymus, the pituitary body, and probably the suprarenal capsules.There is a disease known as Acromegaly, which is characterized hy an enlargement of the extremities, chiefly the hands, and of the face.Both the bony and the soft parts are involved.In a number of cases the disease was associated with pathologic changes in the pituitary body. ATROPHY.Atrophy is a diminution in the bulk of one or more of the component parts of an organ.Since the more important tissue- elements are usually affected, there is also a diminution of functional activity.Normal examples are the atrophy of the thymus gland in early life; of the umbilical blood-vessels after birth; and of the female reproductive organs at the menopause.There may be small- ness of size not due to atrophy.For example, an organ may be diminutive from an arrest of development, a condition termed hypoplasia.It is seen in chlorosis, in which we frequently find that the sexual organs and the heart and great vessels are abnormally small.Total absence of an organ or a part of an organ is called aplasia or agenesis ; it gives rise to monstrosities.Morbid Physiology.-Atrophy is brought about either by an insufficiency in the food supply of the cells, or by an inability on the part of the cells to use the nutritive material brought to them.It is (a) simple, due to a diminution in the size of the cells, without marked change in their protoplasm, or (^) degenerative, due to a breaking down of the protoplasm of the cells.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.An atrophic organ is smaller; its outline is usually retained, although the surface maybe lo NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.irregular; the consistency is, as a rule, greater than normal, on account of a relative or absolute increase of the connective tissue ; its color is darker, from a relative excess of pigment ; frequently, too, new pigment is deposited. .{b) Microscopy.The cells are diminished in size or degenerated ; the connective tissue is increased.Brown Atrophy occurs in organs the seat of chronic con- gestion, especially in the heart and liver.Clinical Causes.i.Senile changes.-These are to a certain extent physiologic ; are pathologic when occurring early.They affect especially the testicle, heart and lungs (senile emphysema).2. Defective nutrition.(a) General, as in starvation.(h) Local deficiency of blood-supply, as from obstruction of an artery.FATTY INFILTRATION.il it is termed obesity or polysarcia ; in the liver, in the heart, around atrophic organs, etc.In obesity certain parts, as the eyelids, the alae nasi, the lobules of the ears, the Hps, and the prepuce escape.His- tologically, the fatty deposit affects both the cells and the inter- cellular substance, the red corpuscles and the ganglion cells of the nervous system being alone exempt.Morbid Physiology.-There exists in fatty infiltration a disturbance of the fat-building and fat-storing functions.The deposit of fat may be due to an excess of food ingested or to an impairment in the consumption of the fat normally brought to cell.Defective oxidation is at the bottom of the process.All food-stuffs, fats, albuminoids, and carbohydrates may give origin to the deposit of fat, particularly the last-named.The albuminous food may be converted into fat within the body ; thus, the cow which consumes but little fat produces a large quantity of it out of the vegetable proteids.Certain post-mortem changes also illustrate the derivation of fat from albuminous substances ; adipocere^a fatty material, may be formed out of the muscles after death.Animals fed on carbohydrates deposit fat.Bees produce wax out of the plant-sugar upon which they feed.How this conver- sion is brought about within the body is not known.Morbid Anatomy.ia)Macroscopy.The size of the organ is increased, but the outline is preserved ; the consistency is usually diminished, yet it may not be greatly altered ; the color is yellowish, either uniformly or in streaks, the latter being the case especially in the heart.The surface of section shows minute fat droplets, and the knife used is oil-stained.(8) Microscopy.Primarily the fat is deposited in small granules, which have a tendency to run together to form large rounded droplets, possessing a light center and a dark contour, or vice versa, depending on the manner of focusing.The protoplasm and nucleus are pushed to one side.The latter retains its structure and can be seen distinctly unless covered by the fat-droplet.In fatty degeneration the tendency of the fat-granules to run together is excep- tional.Fatty infiltration may be selective, affecting particular parts ©f an organ.In the heart, for instance, it is found in the connective tissue between the muscle fibers, and beneath the pericardium.In 12 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.the liver it is especially marked toward the periphery of the acini, where the portal vein deposits the fat coming from the digestive tract.Chemically, the fat of fatty infiltration is the same as that found in the body normally, namely, a mixture of the neutral fats, stearin, palmatin, and olein.In the horse olein predominates, the fat therefore is soft and yellow ; in cattle the harder and whiter stearin is chiefly found.After death, and in certain pathologic states, such as gangrene and other degenerations, dur- ing life, the fat may take on a crystalline form, the crystals being needle-shaped, the so-called margaric-acid crystals, or in large rhombic (a) choiesterin, (*) Fat-platcs, cach with a comcr cut out, constituting ''^'°'^;J:L'c:r\"°' the cholestenn-plates.Clinical Causes.i.Heredity.This is the important factor in general obesity.2. Disturbed digestion.This may cause chemical changes favoring the deposit of fat ; generally, however, it is associated with an excessive appetite.3. Lack of exercise.Not only does deficient physical exercise conduce to fatty infiltration, but also lessened mental activity, as is seen in certain forms of insanity.In fattening animals it is cus- tomary to restrict their exercise to the lowest limit by confinement.4. Anemia^probably by lessening oxidation-processes.We may have an extensive deposit of fat in chlorosis.The fattening of animals for slaughter may be hastened by one or two bleedings.5. Alcohol.The ingestion of alcohol, especially in the form of malt-liquors, favors the deposit of fat either by increasing the consumption of food or by diminishing oxidation.6. Local disturbances of circulation interfering with the proper nutrition of a part. CALCAREOUS INFILTRATION OR CALCIFICATION.Calcification is the deposition in the tissues of earthy salts, principally the carbonates and phosphates ot calcium and magnesium.Physiologic example.The deposit of salts in bone.The salts of pathologic calcification do not differ from those deposited in health.6 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.Morbid Anatomy.-Wefind the insoluble pigments in bruises-here chiefly as hemosiderin-and in hemorrhages in the interior of organs.In the latter instance the pigment is apt to remain for a long time, assuming often a bluish or slate color, as in the intestines after an attack of dysentery.Tests for blood-pigment.To a watery solution of the blood- stain add tincture of guaiac; a white or whitish-red precipitate is produced which turns blue on the addition of an ethereal solution of hydrogen dioxid.The blue precipitate may be dissoiv^ed out with alcohol. (Almen's Test.)This test is very characteristic.The spectroscopic test, which is absolutely positive.The spectrum of hemoglobin (i.e. oxy-hemoglobin), consists of two dark bands, one at the junction of the yellow and green, the other in the middle of the green.Non-oxidized hemoglobin presents a single band, which may be considered to be the result of the union of the two oxy-hemoglobin bands.It is, however, smaller than the combined width of these two bands.Methemoglobin gives rise to three dark bands, the two characteristic of oxy-hemoglobin, with an additional one in the orange.Bile-pigmentation : Jaimdice^or Icterus.Since bile is elaborated exclusively by the liver, the origin of jaundice must always be hepatogenous.It may, however, arise in one of two ways : (a) from simple obstruction of the bile-ducts ; {$) from excessive forma- tion of bile-pigment, this generally occurring when there is an ex- aggerated destruction of blood-coloring matter.It is the latter form to which some clinicians give the name of hematogenous jaundice.Tests, Bile-pigment is insoluble in water and in alcohol ; it is soluble in chloroform, and gives a pretty play of color with nitrous acid or nitric acid containing nitrous acid fumes.{Gmelin-Heifits' Test)Ferrous sulphid, FeS.This results from the action of hydrogen sulphid on the iron contained in the hemoglobin.It is seen post- mortem in the abdominal walls and peritoneum, as a diffuse bluish discoloration.Metabolic Pigmentation.-Thepigment-called melanin -is elaborated out of the protoplasm of the cells, without the intervention of blood-pigment.It occurs normally in the skin the choroid, in hair, etc.Its composition is variable-sometimes it contains iron, at others it does not.Sulphur is generally present.I8 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.any point, disease develops, at one time serous infiltration, at another, as we shall see later, inflammation.(4) Through changes in the walls of the blood-vessels : {a) over-distension {b) disease of the vessel-walls.Character of the Fluid.It has the same composition as the lymph, but contains more water and less corpuscular elements.From inflammatory fluid, which it resembles, it is distinguished by being less inspissated.Its specific gravity does not exceed 1016, and its proportion of albumin is less than three per-cent.Inflam- matory fluid is denser and contains more albumin.Morbid Anatomy-[a) Macroscopy.The part, as a limb, is swollen, pale, somewhat translucent in appearance, pits on pressure, and has a lower temperature than the same part in health.In the case of the lung, we find that the organ is enlarged and on section oozes a frothy serum.Different terms are employed, according to the seat of the effusion : NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.AMYLOID DEGENERATION.This is a progressive degenerative process, affecting especially the connective tissues, and giving rise to the formation of a sub- stance characterized by the amyloid reaction.It is not found in health, although it occurs at times in organs belonging to apparently healthy individuals-it is there indicative of local disease. Seats.Liver, kidney, spleen, walls of the intestines and heart, nervous system and prostate gland.The first three of these are affected with equal frequency, and more often than the other organs.Morbid Physiology-Amyloid substance is the result of a reaction occurring between something derived from the blood and the juices of the tissues.It does not exist preformed in the blood, therefore its deposit is not an infiltration.The ultimate cause of its formation is perhaps in many cases, but not in all, the loss of potassium salts.The amyloid material is an albuminoid.It contains less potas- sium and phosphoric acid and more sodium and chlorin than nor- mal tissue.Alkalies and acids do not dissolve it, and it is very resistent to peptic digestion and to putrefactive processes.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.The affected organ is larger than normal, the increase in size being at times remarkable, the outline is uniform, the borders, if the organ have any, are rounded, the sub- stance of the organ is denser, i. e., less friable, the elasticity is decreased-the organ may be doughy and may pit on pressure.The surface of section is paler than normal, and is somewhat translucent at the edges.The appearance is well described by the term \" waxy \" or \" bacony.\"As a rule the organ is affected uniformly.Not rarely, however, the process is circumscribed to minute areas ; indeed, it may not be apparent to the naked eye at all, unless the characteristic test is applied.It is particularly in the spleen and kidney that the degeneration shows a tendency to limitation.In the former it selects the lym- phoid bodies and adjacent blood-vessels, the condition produced Amyloid degeneration in kidney. NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.The gentian-violet reaction is also given by levulose, while cholesterin and glycogen respond to the iodin-test.The amyloid reaction consists in the development of a blue color when iodin and sulphuric acid are applied to amyloid sub- stance.It is not always obtained, nor is it important.The failure to get it in all cases suggests the possibility that the amyloid substance is not always of the same composition, but that there is a series qf related degenerations leading up to amyloid.The starch reaction is most frequently given by the amyloid bodies.Clinical Causes.-Chronic suppuration^especially that dependent upon tuberculous or syphilitic bone-disease.Amyloid Bodies.-These are small masses of concentrically arranged amyloid material, which are found in the prostate gland ^.nd in the nervous system.The change is here not progressive.The bodies involve the epithelium rather than the connective tissue-at least in the prostate glands, where the epithelial lining of the follicles is affected.They may occur in healthy prostate glands, but are most common in the prostates of old persons in whom the organ is hypertrophied, and its follicles are in a state of catarrhal inflam- mation.In the prostrate gland the bodies are visible to the naked eye, and frequently contain pigment (\"grains of snuff\").In the nervous system they are microscopic in size, and are found beneath the ependyma of the cavities.Though met with in healthy brains and cords, they are most abundant in sclerotic conditions and in epilepsy.They give the iodin-reaction. HYALINE DEGENERATION.This consists in the formation of a substance similar in appear- ance and composition to amyloid material, but not presenting the reactions peculiar to the latter.It attacks almost exclusively the connective tissue, particularly of the walls of the blood-vessels, and shows no tendency to spread to surrounding tissues.The organs in the vessels of which",

      "abstract": "Mass poisoning is characterized by occurrence of similar symptoms in previously healthy people in a narrow time frame. A toxic agent as cause for the health impairment is often not identified during the early stage, especially if oral exposure is causing the mass poisoning. The toxicity of sources can be inherent to the agent itself (e.g. toxic fungi, ethanol and recreational drugs) or be the result of contamination (e.g. toxins from microorganisms or nitrate in food, heavy metals in drinking water). Most mass poisonings are unintended. However, there have also been many incidents reported in the past where mass poisoning was the result of intentional action. Examples are the debasement of food, falsification of alcoholic beverages with methanol, medical drug fraud or “stretching” of drugs with agents showing higher toxicity than the drug itself. The chapter gives an overview of typical and extraordinary scenarios and describes the most important aspects of treatment of mass poisoning, mainly caused by oral exposures.",

      "title": "Alternative and Complementary Modalities for Managing Stress and Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Stress is endemic in our society. More than two thirds of office visits to physicians are for stress-related illnesses, such as heart disease, anxiety disorders, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, cancer, respiratory disorders, accidental injuries, cirrhosis of the liver, and attempted suicide, all of which are leading causes of death in the United States. In addition to causing illness, stress can aggravate other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, herpes, mental illness, alcoholism, drug abuse, and family discord and violence. Stress is not always adverse, however; managed correctly, the problems caused by stress can be minimized. Realistically, stress is a normal aspect of life that must be endured at some level. Additionally, a stress response can be helpful in many ways, motivating persons to work or study or increasing their alertness while taking a test or giving a talk. The problem occurs when stress exceeds a productive level and interferes with the ability to think, remember, and focus on tasks. Stress that is ineffectively managed and remains too high for too long can contribute to multiple illnesses.Americans are using alternative and complementary therapies, often for stress-related complaints. The results of a nationwide survey of 1539 adults published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 1 in 3 Americans uses therapies considered unconventional.1 This study was the landmark investigation that opened the floodgates to exploring and understanding these new therapies and how they work. The most frequently used therapies mentioned in the survey were relaxation techniques, chiropractic, massage therapy, imagery, spiritual healing, lifestyle diets, herbal medicine, mega-vitamin therapy, self-help groups, energy healing, biofeedback, hypnosis, homeopathy, acupuncture, folk remedies, exercise, and prayer. A 1997 follow-up national survey2 by the same team found that use of at least 1 of 16 alternative therapies during the preceding year increased from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997. Overall, use of alternative therapies increased by 25%, total visits to alternative medicine practitioners increased by 47%, and expenditures for alternative goods and services increased by 45% (exclusive of inflation). Results from the follow-up study also indicated that ailing persons most often seek nonmainstream treatments for chronic conditions, such as back problems, anxiety, depression, and headaches. In 1990, an estimated 3 in 10 Americans used at least one alternative therapy; in 1997, the rate was 4 in 10 Americans. Of additional interest, the increased use does not appear to be linked to any particular sociodemographic group.2 Another researcher3 found that compared with nonusers, the majority of users of alternative medicine were more educated and reported poorer health status. They used the alternative therapies not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine, but largely because they found that these healthcare alternatives were more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.3 Indeed, many acute care nurses are becoming aware of ways to incorporate complementary modalities to combat the effects of stress.Q: What exactly is stress and what causes it?The term stress refers to a heightened physical or mental state produced by a change in the internal or external environment. In humans, physical stress is caused by injuries or illnesses and psychological stress by real, perceived, or anticipated threats. Whether stress arises from a cause perceived by sense organs that relay the danger to the brain or from mental actions such as worry or fear, the course of events can be the same.Q: What is the relationship between stress and the body’s hormonal system?When an event such as hospitalization for a patient or environmental work conditions for a staff member is perceived as threatening by the higher cortical centers, signals are sent to the motor cortex and hypothalamus. Several hormones are released from the pituitary and adrenal glands, resulting in a number of physiological manifestations that can produce further harm to already compromised systems.Q: What are some of the symptoms or manifestations of stress?Stress shows itself in 3 general areas: physical, social, and psychological. Physical signs of stress includeSocial manifestations of stress include family conflicts, job tensions, and change in sexual energy. Psychological signs of stress are 3-fold (Table 1). Any patient or staff member with subjective or objective signs of stress is a candidate for one or more stress-reduction therapies.Q: How do you define alternative and complementary therapies?An alternative therapy is one that is used instead of a conventional or mainstream therapy. For example, acupuncture is an alternative therapy. A complementary therapy may be an alternative therapy, but becomes complementary when used in conjunction with conventional therapy. It helps to potentiate the effect of the conventional therapy. For example, massage, which can stand alone as an alternative therapy, can also be used in conjunction with conventional regimens for a variety of problems.Q: What are some of the specific alternative and complementary therapies that you find helpful to counteract stress?Many different therapies that everyone can enjoy are available. See Table 2 for a brief description of the most widely used, evidence-based therapies; for more information, see Holistic Nursing: A Handbook for Practice.4Q: What is the research that validates use of these therapies?All of these modalities have research results to back them up. That is why the therapies in Table 2 are so popular. Let’s take a look at a couple of them individually.Low back pain is one of the most common chronic conditions. In a study5 with a random sample of 50 patients with low-back pain who received spa therapy and 52 who received standard ambulatory care, the findings for the 2 groups were significantly different. Compared with the patients who did not have spa therapy, patients who had the therapy had a significant improvement in spin mobility and in functional scores and a reduction in the daily duration of pain. Assessment of the long-term effects 9 months after therapy showed continued reduction in pain and drug consumption and improvement in spine mobility among the patients who had spa therapy.5Another study6 consisted of 25 randomly selected patients in a hospital setting who had pain from fibromyalgia. Twelve patients had hydrogalvanic baths, and 13 had Jacobson relaxation training. Different dimensions of pain were measured at the beginning and the end of therapy. Patients receiving bath therapy had a significantly greater decrease in pain intensity from breakfast to lunch than did patients who received the Jacobson relaxation therapy.6 Numerous other studies are detailed in the book Healing Waters.7In a study8 of 122 patients in an intensive care unit, 3 therapies were compared for their effects on increasing the quality of sensory input that patients receive and reducing patients’ levels of stress and anxiety. The key findings were that patients who had aromatherapy reported significantly greater improvement in their mood and perceived levels of anxiety. They also felt less anxious and more positive immediately after the therapy, although this effect was not sustained or cumulative.8 When pilot studies on aromatherapy that combined use of essential oils of rose and lavender with touching were done at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the heart variation monitor showed parasympathetic peaks as a subject’s feet were stroked with diluted essential oil. Sometimes just thinking about an aroma or an odor can be as powerful as smelling the actual aroma or odor itself.9Aromas have measurable effects on persons’ feelings. Torii et al10 report on the psychologically stimulating effect of jasmine. Manley11 reports on both the psychologically stimulating effect of lemon, lemon-grass, peppermint, and basil and the relaxing effects of bergamot, chamomile, and sandalwood. Other aromas found to be relaxing are rose and lavender.12 Sweet orange essential oil was effective in both induction of anesthesia and recovery time from anesthesia in children.13These 2 therapies, along with several others, are explored fully in the AACN Protocols for Practice. If you are unfamiliar with these and other complementary therapies, take the opportunity to explore them personally. When you are comfortable with using them yourself, it is easier to introduce them to others.Critical care nursing is more than just meeting the physiological needs of patients. Helping patients and staff members alike to cope with the multiple stressors in the acute care environment is an integral part of nursing. Learning to recognize the manifestations of stress is the first step; the next is adding knowledge and skills about the emerging alternative and complementary therapies in order to cope and prevent the adverse effects of stress.This article is based on the protocol Alternative and Complementary Modalities for Managing Stress and Anxiety in Acute and Critical Care by Lynn Keegan (product #170715: $11, AACN members; $14, nonmembers). It was taken from the Creating a Healing Environment series (set of 5, product #170710; $52, AACN members; $64, nonmembers) of AACN’s Protocols for Practice.

      "title": "Muscle Fatigue in Health and Disease",
      "abstract": "An untrained couch potato involuntarily forced to undergo a long strenuous exercise towards exhaustion will feel it at the end as a discomforting fatigue. A well-trained athlete will feel the same but after a longer time. Patients of various neurological diseases will do so much earlier. All may also finally experience muscle pain and soreness the next day.Muscle fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in maximal voluntary muscle force. Muscle fatigability varies with muscle use, age and sex. It is commonly divided into two broad categories: peripheral and central fatigue. The first refers to the many processes in the fatiguing muscle(s), the second to subsequent processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Peripheral muscle fatigue can be caused by numerous different mechanisms, ranging from the accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibers to their damage. Central fatigue involves the inadequacy of the CNS to generate and maintain sufficiently strong motor command. There must of course be a mediator relating the two fatigue types, and this is the collection of small-diameter group III (A&amp;delta;) and IV (C) nerve fibers emanating from the muscle and distributing their activation effects throughout the CNS.Muscle fatigue develops during eventually exhausting exercise that goes along with activations of the cardio-vascular and respiratory system to supply oxygen and energy resources. While these functions are supported by a number of sensory afferents, fatigue-activated group III/IV muscle afferents have been proposed to contribute their share to cardio-vascular and ventilatory reflex responses that are mediated in the brainstem. Neural feedback from working skeletal muscle is a vital component in providing a high capacity for endurance exercise because muscle perfusion and O₂ delivery determine the fatigability of skeletal muscle (Amann 2012).The development of chronic muscle fatigue is related to muscle wasting mediated by aging, myopathies, muscle dystrophies, immobilization, insulin resistance, diseases associated with systemic inflammation (arthritis, sepsis, infections), trauma, cardio-vascular (heart failure) and respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), chronic kidney failure, multiple sclerosis (MS), and, more recently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "title": "Anxiety in older adults often goes undiagnosed.",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder in the elderly is twice as common as dementia and four to six times more common than major depression. Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.",

      "title": "Apathy",
      "abstract": "Apathy is a disorder of motivation. Apathetic patients have difficulties in starting, sustaining, or finishing any goal-directed activity. They lose self-activation or self-initiated behavior and may present emotional indifference. Apathy is mostly related to damage to subcortical brain structures linked to the anterior cingulate circuit, the so-called motivational circuit. Stroke lesions encompassing the frontal lobe, the cingulum, or subcortical structures such as the pallidus, internal capsule, caudate, putamen, and anterior or medial thalamic nuclei are associated with apathy. Validated scales are used to assess apathy in stroke patients. Apathy is frequent in stroke patients affecting 1 in every 3 patients. Apathetic patients are older than non-apathetic patients. Cognitive impairment is three times more frequent in apathetic than in non-apathetic stroke patients. Although some studies claimed an association between apathy and right-sided stroke lesions, there is no consistent evidence to support this association. Apathy without depression is about two times more frequent than depression without apathy, reinforcing the view that although these two neuropsychiatric disturbances can be associated, one can occur separately from the other. The management of apathy includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Drugs with potential effect in improving apathy include dopaminergic agents, stimulants, antidepressants with dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, there are no randomized controlled trials to prove the efficacy and safety of these interventions in apathetic stroke patients.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa falta de autocontrol es un rasgo esencial de la bulimia nerviosa. Tanto es asi que la impulsividad se ha relacionado con alteraciones neuropsicologicas y psicofisiologicas en estas pacientes. En el presente articulo hemos repasado la literatura que muestra la existencia de una disminucion del control inhibitorio y que explica esa falta de autocontrol sobre conductas como la alimentacion o la actividad sexual. Las pacientes con bulimia nerviosa sucumben con facilidad al deseo intenso por comer y experimentan frecuentes atracones de comida. De forma paralela, la actividad sexual se incrementa y se convierte en incontrolable. Ambos comportamientos, alimentario y sexual, parecen tener como funcion principal aliviar momentaneamente los estados de animo negativos. La literatura, ademas, muestra que esas conductas tan destructivas reflejan la existencia de una gran impulsividad motora y de dificultades en la toma de decisiones. Consecuentemente, la falta de control inhibitorio cronico en los procesos emocionales y psicofisiologicos contribuye a mantener una pobre regulacion emocional, como lo corrobora el aumento de los reflejos defensivos y la baja variabilidad cardiaca que presentan las pacientes con bulimia nerviosa. Finalmente, en este articulo enfatizamos la necesidad de integrar las tecnicas de intervencion conductuales, neuropsicologicas y psicofisiologicas en un intento de mejorar el tratamiento multidisciplinar de la bulimia nerviosa. EnglishLack of self-control is an essential feature of bulimia nervosa; so much so that impulsiveness has been associated with neuropsychological and physiological alterations in these patients. In this paper we review articles on this subject that confirm that the existence of a decrease of inhibitory control explains the lack of self-control in behaviors concerning food or sexual activity. Patients with bulimia nervosa succumb easily to an intense desire for food and experience frequent gluttonous behavior. Similarly, sexual activity increases and becomes uncontrollable. Both food and sexual behaviors seem to have as a main function the momentary relief of negative emotions. The literature, in addition, shows that these highly destructive behaviors reflect the existence of a very low control of impulsive ness and difficulties in decision-making. Consequently, the lack of chronic inhibitory control in emotional and physiological processes contributes to the maintenance of poor emotional regulation. Thus, patients with bulimia nervosa present increased defensive reflexes and low cardiac variability In this article, we emphasize the necessity of integrating behavioral, neuropsychological and physiological intervention techniques to improve multidisciplinary treatment of bulimia nervosa.",

      "title": "Varieties of Self Disorder: A Bio-Pheno-Social Model of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The self-disorder model offers a unifying way of conceptualizing schizophrenia's highly diverse symptoms (positive, negative, disorganized), of capturing their distinctive bizarreness, and of conceiving their longitudinal development. These symptoms are viewed as differing manifestations of an underlying disorder of ipseity or core-self: hyper-reflexivity/diminished-self-presence with accompanying disturbances of \"grip\" or \"hold\" on reality. Recent revision to this phenomenological theory, in particular distinguishing primary-vs-secondary factors, offers a bio-pheno-social model that is consistent with recent empirical findings and offers several advantages: (1) It helps account for the temporal variations of the symptoms or syndrome, including longitudinal progression, but also the shorter-term, situationally reactive, and sometimes defensive or quasi-intentional variability of symptom-expression that can occur in schizophrenia (consistent with understanding some aspects of ipseity-disturbance as dynamic and mutable, involving shifting attitudes or experiential orientations). (2) It accommodates the overlapping of some key schizophrenic symptoms with certain nonschizophrenic conditions involving dissociation (depersonalization, derealization), including depersonalization disorder and panic disorder, thereby acknowledging both shared and distinguishing symptoms. (3) It integrates recent neurocognitive and neurobiological as well as psychosocial (eg, influence of trauma and culture) findings into a coherent but multi-factorial neuropsychological account. An adequate model of schizophrenia will postulate shared disturbances of core-self experiences that nevertheless can follow several distinct pathways and occur in various forms. Such a model is preferable to uni-dimensional alternatives—whether of schizophrenia or ipseity-disturbance—given its ability to account for distinctive yet varying experiential and neurocognitive abnormalities found in research on schizophrenia, and to integrate these with recent psychosocial and neurobiological findings.",

Les chercheurs ont tente d’exclure les patients presentant une depression associee a leur demence. Ainsi, les patients ayant presente un episode depressif majeur dans les six derniers mois ou des symptomes depressifs cliniques lors du recrutement en etaient exclus.

      "abstract": "Gastric and intestinal dyspepsia are classified based on the predominant symptoms. Symptoms of gastric dyspepsia include heaviness and discomfort in the epigastrium, early satiety, belching, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc. Symptoms of intestinal dyspepsia include flatulence, rumbling, diarrhea, constipation, and unstable stool. Furthermore, intestinal dyspepsia is classified as putrefactive or fermentative mostly on the basis of coproscopy data. The symptoms of putrefactive dyspepsia include elevated pH and organic acid and ammonia levels in the stool. The symptoms of fermentative dyspepsia include decreased stool pH and elevated levels of starch, fiber, and iodoform bacteria. The symptoms of biliary dyspepsia include bitter taste in the mouth, loss of appetite, various stool disorders, a feeling of discomfort, heaviness, and distension in the right hypochondrium. The duodenum is acknowledged as the “director” of the digestive organs’ symphony. The pancreas, stomach, gallbladder, and small and large intestines are the “musicians” in this symphony. The duodenum is a special module that facilitates the change from acidic stomach digestion to slightly alkaline intestine digestion with intensive processing of chyme by intestinal enzymes, the pancreas, and bile acids. The pathophysiology of the duodenum’s linkages to other digestive organs, as well as the etiology of gastric, intestinal, and biliary dyspepsia in chronic pancreatitis, are all thoroughly explored in this article. Separate consideration is given to the pathophysiology of dyspepsia in biliary chronic pancreatitis as well as the primary strategies for curing it. The author substantiated the expediency of administering the enzyme preparation of non-animal origin, Panzest, and emphasized its advantages for treating dyspepsia in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The advantages of the release form of Panzest (“capsule within a capsule”) are pointed out. They ensure the release of enzymes in the stomach with continued hydrolysis of nutrients in the duodenum.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the common causes of recurrent vertigo and dizziness that can be diagnosed largely on the basis of history.Ninety percent of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness can be explained by six disorders: (1) Ménière disease is characterized by vertigo attacks, lasting 20 minutes to several hours, with concomitant hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Aural symptoms become permanent during the course of the disease. (2) Attacks of vestibular migraine may last anywhere from minutes to days. Most patients have a previous history of migraine headaches, and many experience migraine symptoms during the attack. (3) Vertebrobasilar TIAs affect older adults with vascular risk factors. Most attacks last less than 1 hour and are accompanied by other symptoms from the posterior circulation territory. (4) Vestibular paroxysmia is caused by vascular compression of the eighth cranial nerve. It manifests itself with brief attacks of vertigo that recur many times per day, sometimes with concomitant cochlear symptoms. (5) Orthostatic hypotension causes brief episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to a few minutes after standing up and is relieved by sitting or lying down. In older adults, it may be accompanied by supine hypertension. (6) Panic attacks usually last minutes, occur in specific situations, and are accompanied by choking, palpitations, tremor, heat, and anxiety. Less common causes of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness include perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence, autoimmune inner ear disease, otosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and medication side effects.Neurologists need to venture into otolaryngology, internal medicine, and psychiatry to master the differential diagnosis of recurrent dizziness.",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3. Other parasomnias, including sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning (catathrenia), exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected. They may occur during the transition between sleep and waking, and vice versa, or during any sleep stages.",

      "title": "Mobilizing ego strengths.",
      "abstract": "In certain special situations in psychoanalytic treatment there is a need to mobilize ego strength: (1) those patients who are \"so infantile\" that they need ego strengthening to mature sufficiently to cope with their lives; (2) patients who regress partially during psychoanalysis and cannot progress without analytic intervention to help strengthen their ego; (3) those patients with a strong tendency toward regression whose egos need immediate strengthening in analysis to prevent an immobilizing regression; (4) those patients for whom a stressful reality situation so undermines their confidence that they fall into a severe regression and need to be helped out of this as an emergency to avoid permanent trouble, such as flunking out of school or getting fired from their jobs. All attempts to mobilize ego strengths require an especially thorough understanding of the psychodynamics and especially of the transference and countertransference. In addition, the patient's ego must be assessed as having the potential for more effective functioning. Usually the patient has been unable to realize this potential because of the various degrees of regression, and the analyst has already made exhaustive analytic interpretation of the unconscious material, including the transference and resistance. He may then shift to a more direct approach, pointing out the patient's ego strengths and giving him an accurate picture of the way he can use these strengths toward his own goals. The aim is to help the patient use his own willpower and ego functions gradually to work on and finally resolve some of his neurotic problems. Accurately and honestly mirroring the patient's ego potentials, encouraging him to use his ego, and providing examples of how others have used their own willpower in comparable situations are usually helpful. The analyst must not impose his own values or goals on the patient but must work with the goals, problems, and strengths the patient has. Seven analytic cases are presented to illustrate different ways of helping the patient to mobilize and utilize his own ego strength. We are not suggesting any new \"technique,\" but only that there is something, which can be recognized as willpower, that can be mobilized for therapeutic effect; the appeal is make primarily by the usual procedure of pointing out reality but with encouragement to the patient in coping with both external and internal stresses, these latter being most often regressive tendencies.",

Diagnosis is categorized as nonanalytic reasoning (intuition) and analytic reasoning (analysis). Rehabilitation nutrition involves the diagnosis of nutritional disorders, sarcopenia, and excess or deficient nutrient intake. There is usually only one correct answer for the presence or absence of these. On the other hand, there may be no single correct answer for the causes of anorexia, weight loss, or sarcopenia, and analytical reasoning is required. In this case, diagnostic reasoning involves hypotheses. Simply using nutritional supplements without performing diagnostic reasoning about these causes is like prescribing antipyretic analgesics to a patient with a headache without diagnosing the cause of the headache. To maximize function and quality of life in rehabilitation nutrition, it is necessary to suspect the common causes of anorexia, weight loss, and sarcopenia in all cases.",

      "title": "What is Different about Eating Disorders for Those with Autistic Spectrum Condition?",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Eating Disorders (EDs) are increasingly recognised as a common comorbid condition in autistic spectrum condition (ASC). The diagnosis of ASC may be delayed in those who present with EDs, especially in females who account for 90% of such presentations. They often mask autistic symptoms by copying their neurotypical peers. This can have adverse consequences, as standard therapeutic approaches to the management of EDs are often ineffective at achieving complete recovery in those with ASC, even among those whose body weight is restored. Methods: We reviewed the recent literature to explore the common factors defining ED’s in ASC and illustrated this with examples from those with lived experience to define potential for therapeutic strategies. Results: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is the commonest subtype of ED in ASC and is contributed to by a high prevalence of associated gastrointestinal disorders. Anxiety over sensory issues with taste and smell are often a significant factor. Biosocial factors such as cognitive rigidity, obsession, compulsion and rigidity are also important. The role of specific issues such as alexithymia, hyperactivity, rejection sensitive dysphoria, personality disorder and gender dysphoria has been previously understated. EDs are likely to be less to do with body image and more to be a consequence of rigid or ritualistic behaviour patterns driven by ASC. Conclusions: Treatment approaches must account for the unique challenges faced by this group. Art and drama therapy may be of help. Cognitive Remediation Therapy, dietitian-led interventions and clinician/carer/patient education have been proposed but have not yet been trialled extensively. We recommend that involvement of those with lived experience of these conditions is an essential part of treatment planning",

Experimental studies have clearly demonstrated a hepatotoxic potential for many of these compounds, but in the clinical situation the picture is far less clear cut because there are remarkably little published data on the incidence of liver damage from these agents in man. Furthermore, interpretation of abnormal liver function tests and ascribing them to a drug rather than to an alternative cause is not always straightforward. Hepatic drug reactions fall into two categories; those which are predictable and dose-related (e.g. acute hepatic necrosis following suicidal overdose with the analgesic paracetamol), and those which are unpredictable and dose-independent, complicating treatment with a drug at therapeutic dosage (Davis and Williams, 1985). Most hepatic drug reactions, including those caused by antidepressants, fall into the second category. The spectrum of severity may vary widely, from minor abnormalities in biochemical liver function tests with no constitutional disturbance, to severe hepatitis and/or cholestasis which can sometimes be fatal. Chronic liver disease has also been described.",

When the patient resists carrying out the compulsions, anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, the obsessions and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both obsessions and compulsions; only a minority presents with either obsessions or compulsions (Foa & Kozak).

      "abstract": "Laboratory animals can develop serotonergic neurotoxicity after repeated doses of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or ‘Ecstasy’. If similar neural damage occurs in humans, this may be evident in cognitive or behavioural impairments. In a review of the behavioural skills shown by drug-free recreational Ecstasy users, three aspects of cognitive performance are often affected: reduced memory for new information (Rivermead Behavioral Memory, supraspan word recall), impaired higher executive processing (Wisconsin Card Sort, Tower of London), and heightened impulsivity (Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness and Empathy Questionnaire, Matching Familiar Figures test). Performance on other more basic cognitive functions is generally unimpaired (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, number vigilance, Stroop, trail making). Some Ecstasy users also complain of poor memories and/or concentration difficulties, which they attribute to MDMA use. There are many methodological problems and uncertainties with research in this field: non-random allocation of subjects to drug conditions, the deleterious effects of other psychoactive drugs, and the possibility that these adverse profiles reflect pre-existing personality characteristics in Ecstasy users. However, this particular pattern of cognitive decrements in humans, is consistent with the animal data on those brain areas showing serotonergic damage following MDMA: the frontal cortex (impulsivity and higher cognitive impairments), and hippocampus (memory deficits). Finally, this profile of cognitive deficits is also consistent with a &lt;i&gt;hypothetical&lt;/i&gt; integrative construct: namely reduced cortical inhibition.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

Agents with constipating properties, such as opioids, neuroleptics, and serotonin antagonists, are causes for constipation, beside immobility, a poor general condition, insufficient nutrition, or insufficient intake of liquids. Different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to constipation. Its assessment and diagnosis should refer to the Rome-III criteria, taking into account a stool free interval of more than 72 hours, the assessment of the subjective „feeling of being constipated”, and the consistence of the stool. The use of laxatives should adapt to these pathophysiological causes according to a step scheme, both for prophylaxis and therapy. The combinational use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives is most effective. Recent approaches include opioid antagonists for the management of an opioid-induced constipation.",

Craving is mainly an explicit or conscious process that can motivate individuals to continue alcohol, take drugs or smoke cigarettes. Craving also plays a role in relapse; self-reported craving has often been associated with relapse. However, craving cannot explain all addictive behaviours. In addition to craving, implicit cognitive processes play an important part in motivating individuals to become involved in substance use.To describe some of these implicit cognitive processes, namely the role of salience, attention bias, automatic memory associations and action tendencies.A description is given of recent research results and the implications of these implicit processes for clinical practice.Oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes both play an important role in addiction. This can be expressed by an uncontrollable urge to inject the drug or substance again, in spite of the fact that it is unwise for the person in question to do so. Recent research has shown that there are various very promising methods for dealing with these two problems (oversensitive/hypersensitive motivational processes and a lack of control over these processes), either separately or together. The methods involve behavioural training programmes, medication and neural stimulation.The research results are very promising, but more research is needed.",

However, sometimes these drug-induced alterations of the body's appetite-regulating mechanisms result in excessive weight gain, thus jeopardizing compliance with prescribed medication. A number of drugs are capable of changing body weight as an adverse consequence of their therapeutic effect. Included in this category are the psychotropic drugs such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Antipsychotics are well-known culprits of weight gain. The low-potency (e.g., chlorpromazine and thioridazine) and atypical agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone) are most often associated with weight gain. Antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are most often associated with significant weight gain. The tertiary tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline is thought to induce the most weight gain. Mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate, valproic acid and carbamazepine also induce weight gain in a considerable number of patients. Treatment with corticosteroids is associated with dose-dependent body weight gain in many patients and corticosteroid-induced obesity aggravates other corticosteroid-associated health risks. Insulin therapy in diabetic patients usually increases body weight. Finally, sulfonylurea derivatives, antineoplastic agents used for the treatment of breast cancer and several drugs used in migraine prophylaxis may cause body weight gain as well.

      "abstract": "In my practice, patients with migraine frequently cannot tolerate even low doses of topiramate. In contrast, patients with epilepsy can usually take quite high doses of this medication. This difference between migraine and epilepsy is reflected in experimental trials in these conditions. For example, in two studies of treatment with topiramate (1,2), 44% of migraine patients withdrew from 125mg per day, whereas only 17% of patients with epilepsy withdrew from a much higher dose of 1000mg. However, it should also be noted that, in the same studies, patients with migraine withdrew at a higher rate of 10% from placebo, in comparison to only 2% in patients with epilepsy. The intolerance to topiramate may be specific, or a reflection of a more general problem with medication. A specific intolerance in migraine could be due to 1) altered metabolism of topiramate resulting in higher levels, or 2) abnormal neuronal systems that have an increased vulnerability to its actions. A more general problem might be explained by 1) enhancement of side effects due to heightened sensitivity to stimulation, or 2) difficulty participating in any treatment, even placebo, because of associated anxiety. Intolerance to topiramate, specific or otherwise, limits its use in migraine and deserves further investigation. The first step would be a systematic review of the clinical trials of all drugs used to treat both migraine and other conditions, comparing withdrawal rates from placebo as well as active treatment.",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

While deficient exercise performance of sick children results from hypoactivity and detraining, it can also be caused by specific pathophysiological factors. These can affect one or more components of physical fitness. A low maximal aerobic power will result from a low maximal stroke volume, as in aortic stenosis or cardiomyopathy; a low maximal heart rate, as in congenital complete heart block or intake of β-blockers; a low O2 content of the arterial blood, as in anemia or advanced cystic fibrosis; and a high O2 content of mixed-venous blood, as in muscle atrophy or severe malnutrition. A high O2 cost of locomotion, as in advanced obesity or cerebral palsy, will cause the patient to exert at a high percentage of his maximal aerobic power and thus fatigue easily. A subnormal muscle strength, as in progressive muscular dystrophy or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is sometimes the primary factor that limits the walking ability or other daily functions. Recent data suggest that local muscle endurance, as assessed by the Wingate anaerobic test, is particularly deficient in some neuromuscular diseases. Examples are muscular dystrophies and spastic cerebral palsy. The ratio of peak anaerobic power to peak aerobic power seems lower in such patients than in able-bodied controls.",

Dissociative disorders (DD) are primarily characterized by dissociation, and dissociative states are also a criterion for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative reactions such as depersonalization/derealization and amnesia (e.g., gaps in awareness/memory) across diagnostic categories are believed to be affect contingent and theorized to serve affect regulation functions. What is not clear, however, is how self-reported affect and physiological reactivity unfold within dissociative episodes. To address this issue, the present project aims to investigate the hypothesis (1) whether self-reported distress (as indicated by arousal, e.g., feeling tense/agitated, and/or valence, e.g., feeling discontent/unwell) and physiological reactivity increase before dissociative episodes and (2) whether self-reported distress and physiological reactivity decrease during and after dissociative episodes in a transdiagnostic sample of patients with DD, BPD, and/or PTSD. Methods and analyses: We will use a smartphone application to assess affect and dissociation 12 times per day over the course of one week in everyday life. During this time, heart and respiratory rates will be remotely monitored. Afterwards, participants will report affect and dissociative states eight times in the laboratory before, during, and after the Trier Social Stress Test. During the laboratory task, we will continuously record heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate, as well as measure blood pressure and take salivary samples to determine cortisol levels. Our hypotheses will be tested using multilevel structural equation models. Power analyses determined a sample size of 85.",

      "title": "Overview of Anxiety and the Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety can be a confusing term because it can have several different meanings and apply to different experiences and behaviors. According to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary [1], anxiety is a vague, uneasy feeling of discomfort or dread accompanied by an autonomic (self-controlling) response. Anxiety alerts individuals to changes, both within them and in the world around them, as part of an internal signal system [2]. Anxiety consists of a range of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and is influenced by biological, psychological, and genetic factors [3]. Anxiety is a normal but at times unpleasant emotion. The subjective experience of anxiety differs, but familiar presentations include symptoms such as apprehension, uneasiness, “butterflies in the stomach,” anticipation, and dread. Objective behavioral manifestations include looking strained and tense, hypervigilance, shakiness, muscle tension, sweaty palms, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, restlessness, and avoidance. Equivalent anxiety experiences may be described as nervousness, tension, worry, restlessness, irritability, agitation, and somatization [4]. Table 1.1 lists common subjective and objective symptoms and descriptors associated with various states of anxiety [2]. Although primary care practitioners are well aware of the many and varied presentations of anxiety symptoms and signs, they can present as true diagnostic dilemmas at times. Individuals experience anxiety as a normal emotion at different times in their lives, and the source may be known, unknown, or nonspecific. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and can help one to cope. Anxiety involves anticipating future danger, and the response can actually help us to avoid potential danger—the “fight or flight” response. Triggers for the anxiety response include psychological threats, the unexpected, novelty, social/performance situations, cognitive mechanisms, and conditioned associative memories [4].",

      "title": "Infant temperament characteristics related to sudden infant death syndrome and its risk factors",
      "abstract": "Three major components have been repeatedly implicated for the origin(s) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): system, minor sickness and surroundings. All these factors also frame infant temperament, and therefore it seems logical to suppose that the babies who either succumb to or are at risk of SIDS may present with certain behavioural features. The infants who have died of SIDS moved less when lying awake in the crib, during feeding and during nail cutting; less often turned their head away and looked for their mother when held by a new person; were more frequently reported to show an extreme response (either almost never protested or almost always objected) when approached by someone other than main caregiver; and exhibited extreme behavioural patterns when the infant’s vocalising on waking up was studied. The infants who died of SIDS had lower activity scores. An unfavourable microenvironment can increase the risk of SIDS, and the babies facing less developmental stimulation had a more negative mood and were less distractible; less organised infants presented with a more negative mood, less distractible behaviour, lower rhythmicity, lower persistence and lower adaptability. The infants born to smoking mothers who are at risk of SIDS had more intensive reactions. The low‐birth‐weight infants who are at high risk of SIDS were more withdrawing and less adaptable. Infant–parent(s) bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, and solitary sleeping infants had a more positive mood and were more persistent. Use of a pacifier may be protective against SIDS, and pacifier users presented with higher rhythmicity. Prone sleep is known to increase the risk of SIDS, and the lowest persistence was a feature of those babies who were usually put to sleep supine and found prone. Infants who snored and/or had noisy breathing in sleep were characterised by more negative mood. Infants with signs of repetitive regurgitation were less distractible.",

If people with schizophrenia experience pleasure and positive emotion, how can they have anhedonia? Our research has shown that people with schizophrenia report <italic>expecting</italic> less pleasure from enjoyable activities, and experience less pleasure <italic>when anticipating</italic> future events, than people without schizophrenia. However, when participating in pleasant activities, people with and without schizophrenia report experiencing the same amount of pleasure.

      "title": "Sleep-Related Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) or night eating syndrome (NES). Critical reviews of the literature on both disorders have suggested that they are situated at opposite poles of a disordered eating spectrum. The feeding behavior in SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating after an arousal from nighttime sleep with amnesia. Conversely, NES could be considered as an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing with a normal circadian timing of sleep onset. Both conditions clearly concentrate to occur during young adulthood, and are often relentless and chronic. Misunderstanding and low awareness of SRED and NES have limited our ability to determine the exact prevalence of the two disorders. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, in particular parasomnias such as sleep walking. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is ineffective, but pharmacotherapy is very effective in controlling SRED. Especially, studies have shown that the anti-seizure medication topiramate may be an effective treatment for SRED.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "One cannot but be struck with the fact that in many (if not in most) attacks of acute insanity the patient, on recovery, has no recollection of the incidents of the illness. She may have answered our questions in a way showing that at the time there was not only a consciousness of a certain kind present, but also the capacity for understanding and replying in accordance with her ideas (however unfounded they may, in fact, be), and yet on recovery, or even in a temporary lucid interval, all remembrance of the disordered state has passed away, and that, too, beyond the capacity of recall—nothing but a misty, hazy remembrance of some condition which has been passed through remains, just as one finds it impossible to re-instate the details of a dream, the reality of which was at the time vivid in consciousness. We have here to deal with a dual consciousness, a knowledge of states apparently incompatible with, and distinct from, each other. We are all familiar with states of acute mental disturbance where there is difficulty in making the patient understand what we are saying—not necessarily difficult or involved questions, but simple queries relating to what we think are matters in the patient‘s consciousness, such as it is. Here it is doubtful if the patients really understand what we are saying, though there is no doubt about their hearing the question, e.g. , they may hear the question but the reply will be merely the reiteration of some particular delusion which has no connection with the question, or there need not be any reply at all, as if we were addressing them in a foreign language which they did not understand, or as if what is said to them has a different meaning from what is intended.",

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "title": "Severe Hot Flashes Are Associated With Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Because hot flashes can occur during the night, their presence has been frequently associated with insomnia in women with symptoms of menopause. However, many factors other than hot flashes or menopause can be responsible for insomnia, and several factors associated with insomnia in the general population are also commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who have hot flashes. <h3>Methods</h3> A random sample of 3243 subjects (aged ≥18 years) representative of the California population was interviewed by telephone. Included were 982 women aged 35 to 65 years. Women were divided into 3 groups according to menopausal status: premenopause (57.2%), perimenopause (22.3%), and postmenopause (20.5%). Hot flashes were counted if they were present for at least 3 days per week during the last month and were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their effect on daily functioning. Chronic insomnia was defined as global sleep dissatisfaction, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, for at least 6 months. Diagnoses of insomnia were assessed according to the<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>, classification. <h3>Results</h3> Prevalence of hot flashes was 12.5% in premenopause, 79.0% in perimenopause, and 39.3% in postmenopause. Prevalence of chronic insomnia was reported as 36.5% in premenopause, 56.6% in perimenopause, and 50.7% in postmenopause (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Prevalence of symptoms of chronic insomnia increased with the severity of hot flashes, reaching more than 80% in perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women who had severe hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, severe hot flashes were significantly associated with symptoms and a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Poor health, chronic pain, and sleep apnea were other significant factors associated with chronic insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severe hot flashes are strongly associated with chronic insomnia in midlife women. The presence of hot flashes should be systematically investigated in women with insomnia. Treating hot flashes could improve sleep quality and minimize the deleterious consequences of chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Case Study : Prognosis of Recurrent Depressive Disorder with Somatic Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a common disease worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. Especially if it lasts a long time and is of moderate or severe intensity, depression can be a serious health condition. Depression can cause affected people to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school, and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. In general, the good prognosis of depressive episodes can be achieved as well as good response to treatment and early interventions, but with the absence of any other complication such as psychotic symptoms and somatic complaints. This paper discusses the prognosis of recurrent depressive disorders with somatic complaints through a case study. Case: Male 23 years old complained of headaches that did not improve with pain medication and often recurred for two weeks, feels tingling and heavy in the back, worsening at night, interfere with the patient's daily activities and sleep in the night. These depressive symptoms have recurred since the patient was 19 years old. The patient experienced repeated stress due to arguments between his parents who were often involved in verbal abuse. The patient's prognosis is analyzed using several aspects according to Maramis prognosis analysis, including age, premorbid personality, type of disorder, course of treatment, hereditary factors, and the presence/absence of precipitating factors. Discussion: According to the course of the disease, the patient experienced recurrent depression since the age of less than 20 years, with somatic symptoms currently accompanying his depressive disorder. The patient experienced repeated recurrences even though he was stated to have improved by the treating doctor, which indicates that the patient's stress management was inadequate. The patient is currently experiencing a skin disorder that worsens his pessimistic feelings and is receiving SSRI antidepressants to improve his depressive symptoms. Based on the analysis of the course of the disease, the prognosis for depressive disorders in patients is poor, or dubia ad bonam. Conclusions: Recurrent depressive disorders involving younger ages, complications such as somatic symptoms, suboptimal social support, inadequate coping mechanisms, will worsen the prognosis of depression even after receiving adequate treatment",

      "abstract": "The systemic administration of a potent muscarinic agonist pilocarpine in rats promotes sequential behavioral and electrographic changes that can be divided into 3 distinct periods: (a) an acute period that built up progressively into a limbic status epilepticus and that lasts 24 h, (b) a silent period with a progressive normalization of EEG and behavior which varies from 4 to 44 days, and (c) a chronic period with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). The main features of the SRSs observed during the long-term period resemble those of human complex partial seizures and recurs 2-3 times per week per animal. Therefore, the pilocarpine model of epilepsy is a valuable tool not only to study the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy in human condition, but also to evaluate potential antiepileptogenic drugs. This review concentrates on data from pilocarpine model of epilepsy.",

      "title": "The effect of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity on sleep, brain and cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract In alcohol use disorder, drinking cessation is frequently associated with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Early in abstinence (within the first 2 months after drinking cessation), when patients do not exhibit physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome anymore (such as nausea, tremor or anxiety), studies report various brain, sleep and cognitive alterations, highly heterogeneous from one patient to another. While the acute neurotoxicity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is well-known, its contribution to structural brain alterations, sleep disturbances and neuropsychological deficits observed early in abstinence has never been investigated and is addressed in this study. We included 54 alcohol use disorder patients early in abstinence (from 4 to 21 days of sobriety) and 50 healthy controls. When acute physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were no longer present, patients performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment, a T1-weighted MRI and a polysomnography for a subgroup of patients. According to the severity of the clinical symptoms collected during the acute withdrawal period, patients were subsequently classified as mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome (mild-AWS) patients (Cushman score ≤ 4, no benzodiazepine prescription, N = 17) or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome (moderate-AWS) patients (Cushman score &amp;gt; 4, benzodiazepine prescription, N = 37). Patients with severe withdrawal complications (delirium tremens or seizures) were not included. Mild-AWS patients presented similar grey matter volume and sleep quality as healthy controls, but lower processing speed and episodic memory performance. Compared to healthy controls, moderate-AWS patients presented non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, widespread grey matter shrinkage and lower performance for all the cognitive domains assessed (processing speed, short-term memory, executive functions and episodic memory). Moderate-AWS patients presented a lower percentage of slow-wave sleep, grey matter atrophy in fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus regions, and lower short-term memory and executive performance than mild-AWS patients. Mediation analyses revealed both direct and indirect (via fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus atrophy) relationships between poor sleep quality and cognitive performance. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, which reflects neurotoxic hyperglutamatergic activity, should be considered as a critical factor for the development of non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, fronto-insular atrophy and executive impairments in recently detoxified alcohol use disorder patients. The glutamatergic activity is involved in sleep-wake circuits and may thus contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related brain damage, resulting in cognitive deficits. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and sleep quality deserve special attention for a better understanding and treatment of brain and cognitive alterations observed early in abstinence, and ultimately for more efficient relapse prevention strategies.",

We report two cases suffering from visual and auditory hallucinations: Case 1 abruptly stopped taking paroxetine (20 mg/day), and Case 2 discontinued paroxetine after reducing the dose from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day for 5 months. Both cases experienced visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to dizziness, headache, insomnia, and nausea a couple of days after paroxetine discontinuation. These observations suggest that hallucinations are a part of the discontinuation syndrome that results from paroxetine discontinuation. Physicians should be aware of this symptom.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

      "title": "Compulsivity in anorexia nervosa: a transdiagnostic concept",
      "abstract": "The compulsive nature of weight loss behaviours central to Anorexia Nervosa (AN), such as relentless self-starvation and over-exercise, has led to the suggestion of parallels between AN and other compulsive disorders such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and addictions. There is a huge unmet need for effective treatments in AN, which has high rates of morbidity and the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, yet a grave paucity of effective treatments. Viewing compulsivity as a transdiagnostic concept, seen in various manifestations across disorders, may help delineate the mechanisms responsible for the persistence of AN, and aid treatment development. We explore models of compulsivity that suggest dysfunction in cortico-striatal circuitry underpins compulsive behaviour, and consider evidence of aberrances in this circuitry across disorders. Excessive habit formation is considered as a mechanism by which initially rewarding weight loss behaviour in AN may become compulsive over time, and the complex balance between positive and negative reinforcement in this process is considered. The physiological effects of starvation in promoting compulsivity, positive reinforcement and habit formation are also discussed. Further research in AN may benefit from a focus on processes potentially underlying the development of compulsivity, such as aberrant reward processing and habit formation. We discuss the implications of a transdiagnostic perspective on compulsivity, and how it may contribute to the development of novel treatments for AN.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

The condition gradually fades away within a few hours or during a night's sleep, and what remains is lack or loss of memory for the episodic period or sometimes retrograde amnesia. Relapses were not observed in the majority of patients. The disease usually develops in people in their sixth to eighth decades of life. The cause of the disease is not yet fully understood.

Previously it was considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion. There is no single confirmatory test and no specific cure for IBS. Several diagnostic criteria exist that evaluate symptoms and their duration, for example, the Manning and Rome criteria, but they are not always helpful in practice because of complex interactions between IBS and chronic pain syndromes. The condition is extremely common, especially in young adults, but symptoms can occur at any age. Emotion and stress are aggravating factors. Lifetime prevalence is estimated to be approximately 20%, but most patients never consult a medical practitioner. Treatment should be tailored to individual symptoms with dietary changes, exercise, psychotherapy and medication (e.g. bulk-forming laxatives, antispasmodics, antibiotics, probiotics and/or agents active at serotonin receptors). The pharmacist has an important supportive role to play in the optimal management of IBS.",

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extraordinarily broad, and includes: (i) disorders of the abdominal viscera, (ii) drug, toxin or other exposures, (iii) infection, (iv) central nervous system disease, (v) metabolic and endocrine disease and (vi) other miscellaneous causes. There is a lack of controlled trials to guide a diagnostic algorithm for nausea and vomiting; current recommendations are largely based on expert opinion with an evidence rating of C. Often, the history and physical examination will lead to the etiology of nausea and vomiting. Initial evaluation should to help determine or confirm the etiology of the symptoms and determine consequences of the symptoms, such as dehydration. Treatment should be directed at managing the underlying disease.",

Underdeveloped structures or pre-existing damage in brain areas may also contribute to the genesis of the syndrome. Brain morphology in 21 patients with OSA and in 21 control subjects was assessed using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional brain images were obtained with voxels of approximately 1 mm3. Images were spatially normalized and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. For each segment, regional volumetric differences were determined relative to age, handedness, and group (patients with OSA versus control subjects), using voxel-based morphometry, with OSA effects weighted by disease severity. A significant age effect on total gray matter was found in control subjects but not in patients with OSA. Diminished regional and often unilateral gray matter loss was apparent in multiple sites of the brain in patients with OSA, including the frontal and parietal cortex, temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Unilateral loss in well-perfused structures suggests onset of neural deficits early in the OSA syndrome. The gray matter loss occurs within sites involved in motor regulation of the upper airway as well as in areas contributing to cognitive function.",

      "title": "1043 A Rare Case of Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder in A Sighted Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which causes failure of endogenous circadian rhythm cycles to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Despite an unknown prevalence in sighted people, it's thought to be rare. We present a case of a sighted patient with concurrent bipolar disorder who presented with excessive sleepiness since preadolescence, and was later found to have N24SWD. Report of case(s) A 29 year old woman with bipolar disorder presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep schedule since age 12. During her teenage years she often fell asleep at school, and she felt the sleepiness could be associated with psychotropic medication. As she grew up, despite her bipolar disorder was well-controlled, the daytime sleepiness persisted, which caused great challenge concentrating at work and difficulty holding a job. She denies cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or restless legs syndrome symptoms. She had no history of shift work or abnormal movements during sleep. Her bedtime advanced and cycled through a 24-hour period according to sleep diary. Her rise time maintains a consistent interval with her bedtime. Previously she had multiple sleep latency test and polysomnogram, after which she was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. She was treated with several stimulants without much improvement. She was offered CBT-I but hasn’t gone. She failed trial of a standardized schedule and found it stressful. She tried melatonin and light therapy for a short time without much of success, she was subsequently started on tasimelteon and the clinical response is to be followed. Conclusion N24SWD is reportedly rare in the sighted population, with a possible different mechanism from that of the blind population. Behavioral and environmental factors might contribute to the dysynchrony between a normal central circadian pacemaker and a non-24-hour sleep-wake behavioral pattern. Our patient's sleepiness persisted despite her psychiatric disorders were in remission. Altered circadian rhythms are not uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may be a trait marker of bipolar disease. Some antidepressant are also found to cause potential iatrogenic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Psychosocial interventions that target stabilizing daily rhythms in patients with concurrent psychiatric illness can be helpful. Support (if any)",

The majority of patients experienced one or more consecutive 48-hour sleep-wake cycles (alternate nights with no sleep) when they switched out of depression into mania of hypomania. During a depressive phase, nine rapidly cycling patients were asked to simulate a 48-hour sleep-wake cycle by remaining awake for 40 hours (one night's total sleep deprivation). Eight switched out of depression, and seven were rated as manic or hypomanic; indicating that sleep loss (such as occurs with spontaneous 48-hour sleep-wake cycles) may help to trigger switches from depression to mania. The 48-hour sleep-wake cycles in patients may depend on a mechanism that is normally present in all humans, since normal persons also spontaneously experience near-48 hour sleep-wake cycles in certain experimental conditions.",

Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition.

Additionally, the content of a patient’s obsessions in OCD can shift to different categories in their life, including ED recovery (e.g., intrusive thoughts that they are going to relapse). To address the challenges of treating comorbid OCD and EDs, it is important to promote flexibility in various aspects of meal planning such as incorporating a variety of foods, being flexible with meal times, meal prepping, and promoting mindfulness and self-compassion. Cognitive techniques such as cognitive restructuring can be used to help patients identify and challenge rigid and perfectionistic thinking. Gradual exposure to flexibility can also be used to help patients learn to tolerate and manage their anxiety. A collaborative approach involving patients in the meal-planning process can also be helpful in reducing rigidity and promoting a more active role in decision-making.",

Conversely, a majority of patients with Cushing's syndrome of any cause report neuropsychiatric symptoms, most often changes in mood and cognition. Only the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Cushing's disease have been well documented; they differ from those of major depression in important ways. In Cushing's disease, the depression, if present, is intermittent rather than sustained, and there is weight gain (rather than weight loss), more irritability, and less psychomotor retardation, withdrawal, and hopelessness. Depression, irritability, and loss of libido often occur early in Cushing's disease, sometimes even before patients are aware that they have physical symptoms other than weight gain. The quality of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and their early occurrence in Cushing's disease argue against a nonspecific response (e.g., demoralization) to severe physical illness. After the Cushing's disease is cured, the neuropsychiatric symptoms usually abate, but their resolution does not always parallel the resolution of endocrine symptoms. The pathophysiology of the hypercortisolemia in depression and Cushing's disease seem to reflect abnormalities in different loci (e.g., at or above the hypothalamus in depression and at the pituitary in Cushing's disease).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of episodic ataxia in a single kindred associated with a previously unreported mutation.\n BACKGROUND: Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with recurrent attacks of ataxia, vertigo, dysarthria, and nystagmus which may be precipitated by exercise, stress, or alcohol. Attacks are classically responsive to acetazolamide. EA2 is caused by mutations in the P/Q Type Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channel, Alpha A1Subunit (CACNA1A) gene.\n DESIGN/METHODS: We discuss a 55 year old man who presented with attacks of “dizziness”, imbalance, dysarthria, body jerks, and blurred vision of approximately 3 years duration. On interictal exam, he had sustained gaze-evoked nystagmus and a wide-based, ataxic gait. He could not identify triggers for his attacks. Acetazolamide 500 mg twice daily failed to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. The patient’s 33 year old daughter was clumsy in infancy. Attacks of vertigo, dysarthria and impaired balance began at age 16. She identified caffeine, exertion, and stress as triggers for her attacks. On exam she was found to have sustained gaze-evoked nystagmus with normal coordination and gait. Attack frequency was reduced with acetazolamide 250 mg daily.\n RESULTS: Both patients were tested for EA2 and found to have identical, previously unreported mutations in intron 19 c 3093-A>G, altering the conserved 5’ acceptor site for the exon. This was predicted to cause aberrant splicing and a similar mutation, also resulting in an A to G change, has been described in the 3’ acceptor site of intron 36 in another EA2 kindred.\n CONCLUSIONS: This novel terminal mutation resulted in a typical EA2 phenotype in our female patient. However, her father’s presentation is atypical, with late onset and no response to acetazolamide. Variability in phenotype within kindreds, even with identical mutations, can present a diagnostic challenge in EA2. Disclosure: Dr. Tate has nothing to disclose. Dr. Siddiqui has received research support from the Hanes Foundation.",

      "abstract": "A variety of disorders—including infectious, inflammatory, hereditary, and metabolic diseases—may affect both the brain and abdominal cavity, and the findings in one region may help establish the diagnosis or limit the differential diagnosis. Establishing an accurate early diagnosis enables clinicians to adequately manage these unusual diseases and potentially avert life-threatening complications. For example, an early diagnosis of Gardner syndrome enables annual sigmoid- or colonoscopy and ultrasonography. In many conditions, abdominal manifestations precede neurologic manifestations and may have prognostic significance. Patients with celiac disease more often present with abdominal manifestations such as duodenitis, slow transit time, reversal of the jejunal-ileal fold pattern, and transient small bowel intussusception than with intracranial manifestations. In other conditions, the neurologic manifestations may be the same as the presenting symptoms. For example, patients with Gardner syndrome may initially present with multiple mandibular or sinonasal osteomas. In addition, sarcoidosis may manifest with multifocal enhancing dural masses. Abdominal and neurologic manifestations may even occur simultaneously, as in several of the phakomatoses such as neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel–Lindau syndrome. Ultimately, familiarity with the appearances of these conditions allows radiologists to pinpoint a diagnosis, even when imaging findings in either location are nonspecific.",

      "abstract": "Article Abstract Pills and capsules may release their contents within minutes of ingestion; these are immediate-release formulations. Pills and capsules may also release their contents after a time lag, or a little at a time, or in some other predetermined way; these are time-release formulations. Many drugs in psychiatry have been time-release formulated to reduce their local adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract, to reduce adverse effects associated with peak blood levels, or to artificially extend their half-life. Time-release formulations are associated with the added advantages of convenience of dosing, improved compliance, and less fluctuation in blood levels across the course of the day. A disadvantage of time-release formulations is that they may be incompletely absorbed; this is a serious issue in patients with acute or chronic intestinal hurry disorders, such as gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. Time-release formulations may also be more expensive than immediate-release formulations. Each month in his online column, Dr Andrade considers theoretical and practical ideas in clinical psychopharmacology with a view to update the knowledge and skills of medical practitioners who treat patients with psychiatric conditions.",

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

MHP isclassified as a somatic type of delusional disorder in DSM-IV and is defined as an erroneous conviction of bodily disease, abnormality or alteration. It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

Food disorders are characterized by different constellations of symptoms, and their onset can be the result of a multitude of personal histories. As with any other childhood disorder, parents' reactions to their children's eating behaviours play a primary role in influencing their future behaviours. Low attunement in parental responses, including, for example, poor structuring of meal times, or providing food that is not age-appropriate, or offering the child's favourite foods as a means to avoid food rejection, serve to reinforce the problems manifested by the child. The mindfulness-based approach is increasingly used in the treatment of a wide variety of pathologies. Mindfulness-based interventions are based on the ability to focus on the present moment, adopting a non-judgemental attitude.",

      "abstract": "The psychotropic drugs responsible for side effects on the gastrointestinal tract are essentially those that develop the most effective anticholinergic actions. But also to be taken into account are the depression of the central nervous system, the alpha adrenergic effects and the indirect results of the relief of the anxiety and depression symptoms. In spite of the anti-emetic properties of the antipsychotic drugs, nauseas and vomiting appear as frequently as with placebos. The antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs provoke dysphagia and achalasia, because of a loss of tonus. Some cases of hiatal hernia are attributed to tricyclic antidepressants. The latter drugs, as well as IMOA and aliphatic and piperidinated phenothiazines, induce constipation in psychiatric patients, who are already prone to it. Even ileus may occur, or dilatation of the bowel or the stomach. Diarrhea is rare. Patients treated with psychotropics often complain of a dry mouth (xerostomy). This unpleasant sensation is succesfully treated with betanechol (75 mg/d) which does not impair - as pilocarpine does - the therapeutic effects. Dental caries, moniliasis and parotidites have been attributed to neuroleptic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants, on account of the inhibition of the salivary flow. Vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric burning appear in 10% of the patients treated with lithium (even when the posology is correct).",

The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found.

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect. Pain that is not worsened by movement can make some patients restless, mainly as a distractive behaviour.",

Her premedication comprised thiopentone sodium (200 mg) and succinylcholine (30 mg). She received 3 treatments uneventfully. A day after the fourth treatment, she described her awareness of paralysis during the last procedure and refused further treatment despite the marked improvement that had resulted with ECT.Electroconvulsive therapy is more usually administered with bilateral than with unilateral electrode placement. During ECT, awareness under anesthesia and recall of paralysis (resulting from inadequate doses of anesthesia and/or premature administration of the muscle relaxant) may be more common than is generally realized but may not be reported by patients because bilateral ECT tends to obliterate the memory of the ECT procedure. If this is true, unilateral nondominant ECT, which is relatively memory sparing, may increase the chance of recollection of paralysis when narcosis under anesthesia is incomplete. Careful clinical assessment and monitoring of the depth of anesthesia using the bispectral index can minimize this risk of awareness under anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "The most significant challenge that the average person has in this fast-paced day is a troubled, unsatisfied mind as a result of leading an inappropriate lifestyle. The average person has also been significantly impacted by changes in the timing of their sleep and wakefulness, as well as by the absence of physical activity and the inclusion of outside junk foods in their diet. Ayurvedic scriptures identify ahara, nidra, and vyayam as the three sub-pillars of life. More specifically, ahara refers to one's nutrition; nidra refers to one's sleeping habits; and vyayam refers to one's physical activity. The consequences of living in such an unhealthy manner are seen in individuals today in the form of a wide variety of diseases, both mental and physical. The constant overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system has also had a deleterious impact on the quality of sleep. Alterations to one's lifestyle, together with consistent yoga practice, may be useful in reversing the course of this worsening illness and enhancing the health and well-being of the general population.",

      "title": "Visual trails: When perceptual continuity breaks down",
      "abstract": "“Visual trailing” is a transient but dramatic disturbance of visual motion perception of unknown origin: the subject perceives a series of discrete stationary images trailing in the wake of otherwise normally moving objects. Although this phenomenon is most frequently encountered after ingestion of prescription and/or illicit drugs (i.e. Lysergic Acid Diethylamid or LSD), it has also occasionally been reported following brain damage or neurological disorders. Visual trails, because of their discrete and repetitive nature, may represent the perceptual manifestation of an underlying periodic neural process. This periodicity could arise outside of the visual system altogether (e.g. eye movements, motor tremor), or may be the result of faulty motion computation mechanisms (e.g. motion smear suppression), or finally, may point to a more general oscillatory process that affects, among other things, the motion perception system. However, only qualitative case reports exist in the literature, and a quantitative account of visual trails is currently lacking. We report our attempt to collect both qualitative and quantitative data on this phenomenon by means of an online survey. We simulated visual trails in a short movie and varied the interval between successive persisting images of moving objects (10 intervals between 25 and 250 ms); then we instructed past users of LSD (as assessed via a questionnaire) to report which sequence best corresponded to their experience of visual trails. Although the survey is still ongoing, we present results from more than 200 responses. Participants consistently selected a time interval between images of 60 ms on average, corresponding to an underlying periodicity in the 15–20 Hz (beta) range. This is but a preliminary step, and we suggest key experiments that should help identify the oscillatory underpinnings of this rare disturbance, and eventually lead to important insights into how our brains update conscious visual perception in time.",

      "title": "Ataxia and Disequilibrium",
      "abstract": "Ataxia and disequilibrium are clinical symptoms expressing basic conditions of body balance. The author proposed to give them clear definitions concerning the human posture. Ataxia would mean the failure in maintaining the posture during more complicated movement, while disequilibrium implys the disturbed body balance in static posture while standing or sitting. Fukuda referred the difference between disequilibrium and ataxia to the postural change, static to active, during vestibular stimulation.There are many complaints and symptoms relating to ataxia and disequilibrium. Several points in this field were raised and discussed for the future clinical purpose.1. An abnormal sensation called “Memai” in Japanese arises with ataxia or disequilibrium. It may be classified into three categories. The first category “vertigo” is a moving sensation, which is typically accompanied with vestibular dysfunction. The second, dizziness or giddiness, is a kind of unsteadiness such as staggering, blurred vision or weakness at the knees. The third contains inconstant symptoms, for example diplopia, malaise, feebleness, nausea and fainting. Those symptoms belong to a new concept of “Memai” and seem to be directly related to ataxia.2. The characteristics of labyrinthine disequilibrium were 1) laterality or past pointing, 2) easy to be compensated after onset of lesion, 3) accompanying a rotatory horizontal nystagmus, 4) no sensory disorder and 5) measurable by neurootological tests.3. Causes of ataxia were enumerated and several new diagnostic techniques were mentioned. The measurements of optokinetic nystagmus potential and correlation between head movement and movement of the center of gravity seem to be useful diagnostic tools for vertiginous and ataxic patients.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Nutrition in Overtraining Syndrome: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Competition between athletes and an increase in sporting knowledge have greatly influenced training methods while increasing the number of them more and more. As a result, the number of athletes who have increased the number and intensity of their workouts while decreasing recovery times is rising. Positive overtraining could be considered a natural and fundamental process when the result is adaptation and improved performance; however, in the absence of adequate recovery, negative overtraining could occur, causing fatigue, maladaptation, and inertia. One of the earliest forms of fatigue is overreaching. It is considered to be an accumulation of training that leads to reduced sports performance, requiring days or weeks to recover. Overreaching, if followed by adequate recovery, can lead to an increase in athletic performance. Nonetheless, if overreaching becomes extreme, combined with additional stressors, it could lead to overtraining syndrome (OTS). OTS, caused by systemic inflammation, leads to central nervous system (CNS) effects, including depressed mood, further inflammation, central fatigue, and ultimately neurohormonal changes. There are therefore not only physiological, biochemical, and immunological but also psychological symptoms or markers that must be considered, independently or together, being intrinsically linked with overtraining, to fully understand OTS. However, to date, there are very few published studies that have analyzed how nutrition in its specific food aspects, if compromised during OTS, can be both etiology and consequence of the syndrome. To date, OTS has not yet been fully studied, and the topic needs further research. The purpose of this narrative review is therefore to study how a correct diet and nutrition can influence OTS in all its aspects, from prevention to treatment.",

The age disorientated systematically under-estimate the present year and their duration of hospital stay; in individual patients the errors they make are consistent with their concept of their own age. \"Time stands still\" for these patients. However, there are patients in whom an incorrect appreciation of their own age co-exists with correct awareness of the present year. Between these patients and those for whom subjective time stands still, there appears to be a continuum of increasing temporal disorientation.

      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height.

Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

      "abstract": "Depressed patients tend to be forgetful, and for them a simple dosage regimen is particularly appropriate. The use of a single daily dosage depends on the drug having a relatively long (over 36 hours) half-life in the body and being tolerated in a single large dose. Many tricyclic anti-depressives fulfil these requirements provided that the single dose is given before the patient goes to bed. Unwanted effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision, which are troublesome during the day, are not a problem during sleep. The sedative actions of many of these drugs can help the insomniac depressed patient who might otherwise need a separate hypnotic.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Seizures",
      "abstract": "Seizures occur when bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity translate into motor activity. Seizure activity takes on a variety of presentations, depending upon the patient and the degree to which one or both cerebral hemispheres are involved. Generalized seizures are characterized by whole-body involvement, collapse, and loss of consciousness. Patients often exhibit extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Limbs also frequently demonstrate paddling behavior. Unconscious behaviors, such as chewing, licking, swallowing, and vocalizing, may emerge during seizure activity. Autonomic signs may also appear. It is not uncommon for patients to lose control over their urinary bladders or bowels. At times, seizures may be difficult to differentiate from syncopal episodes. Thorough history taking may help to distinguish the two. Partial seizures, on the other hand, may resemble dyskinesias. Partial seizures involve one region of one cerebral hemisphere, and may therefore target any part of the body. The neck, trunk, or limbs are most commonly involved. There are many causes of seizures, regardless of whether they are generalized or partial. For ease of consideration, causes of seizure activity may be described as being intra- or extracranial. These categories prioritize differentials differently based upon the patient's age. In a pediatric patient, meaning one that is less than one year of age, seizures are most likely due to a developmental defect or traumatic injury. Other common causes of pediatric seizures include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as from a portosystemic shunt (PSS) or neonatal hypoglycemia. Young adult to middle-aged patients, on the other hand, are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, as compared to seniors, which are more likely to develop intracranial neoplasia. Most seizures are self-limiting. However, a fraction of seizures may become protracted, either in terms of their duration or frequency. Cluster seizures occur when the frequency of seizures exceeds two over a 24-h period. Status epilepticus occurs when either a seizure lasts for more than 5 min, or multiple seizures overlap such that patient recovery time between events is eliminated. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although delayed gastric emptying has been described in several functional gastrointestinal disorders, and appears to be especially common in functional dyspepsia, the relationship of this finding to symptoms and basic pathophysiology is difficult to define. The delineation of the interactions between delayed gastric emptying, on the one hand, and symptom pathogenesis, on the other, has been hampered by several factors. These include the limitations of the methodology itself, the extent of overlap between the various functional disorders and the sensitivity of gastric emptying to factors external to the stomach, be they elsewhere within the gastrointestinal tract, in the central nervous system or in the environment. In many instances, delayed gastric emptying is an epiphenomenon, reflecting the overlap between inadequately defined functional syndromes, shared pathophysiology or the activation of physiological interactions between the various organs of the gut. In others, it may imply a truly diffuse motor disorder. The disappointments attendant on attempts to alleviate symptoms through approaches designed to accelerate gastric emptying should therefore not come as a surprise. Pending the definition of the true significance of delayed gastric emptying in all functional gastrointestinal disorders, caution should be exerted in the interpretation of this finding in a patient with functional symptoms.",

      "title": "Nonlinear Stimulation and Hormesis in Human Aging: Practical Examples and Action Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "The process of aging is accompanied by a progressive reduction of biological dynamical sophistication, resulting in an increased probability of dysfunction, illness, and death. This loss of sophistication is inherent in all aging organisms. However, it may be possible to retard the rate of loss of biological complexity by introducing an increased amount of nonlinear, nonmonotonic external stimulation that challenges the organism and forces it to upregulate its biological processes. This can be achieved by exploiting the multiple effects of hormesis, through a wide range of challenges including physical, mental, and biological stress. Hormesis is widely encountered in biological systems, and its effects are also seen in humans. It is possible to use hormetic strategies (both conditioning hormesis and postexposure conditioning hormesis) to enhance the function of repair processes in aging humans and therefore prevent age-related chronic degenerative diseases and prolong healthy lifespan. Such techniques include dietary restriction and calorie restriction mimetics, intermittent fasting, environmental enrichment, cognitive and sense stimulation, sexuality-enhancing strategies, exposure to low or to high temperatures, and other physicochemical challenges. Current research supports the general principle that any type of a hormetic dose–response phenomenon has an effect that does not depend on the type of stressor and that it can affect any biological model. Therefore, novel types of innovative, mild, repeated stress or stimulation that challenge a biological system in a dose–response manner are likely to have an effect that, properly harnessed, can be used to delay, prevent, or reverse age-related changes in humans.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

We will argue that this is the product of an imbalance between two separate, but interacting, neural systems: (1) an impulsive, amygdala-dependent system for signaling the pain or pleasure of immediate prospects and (2) a reflective, orbitofrontal-dependent system for signaling the prospects of the future. The conditions that lead to this imbalance include (1) a dysfunctional reflective system and (2) a hyperactive impulsive system. In other words, drugs can acquire properties of triggering bottom-up, involuntary signals through the amygdala that modulate, bias, or even hijack, top-down, goal-driven attentional resources needed for the normal operation of the reflective system and exercising the will. © 2006 by Sage Publications, Inc.",

No references for antiepileptic drugs and especially for lamotrigine are known regarding pharmacologically induced RBD. Case Report: We report a case of a 68-year-old man already suffering from RBD, who developed very brief episodes of epigastric discomfort followed by impaired consciousness and was given a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lamotrigine was started at 25 mg/d, reached a maximum of 100 mg/d after 2 months and was retained at this dose for 1 more month. During this period there was a slight decrease in the episodes of impaired consciousness and no appreciable changes in the frequency and intensity of RBD symptomatology. Immediately following the abrupt discontinuation of lamotrigine, RBD symptomatology was severely aggravated, with dreams becoming more vivid and frightening and occurring almost every night. RBD symptomatology gradually subsided over 2 months, reaching levels comparable to those before lamotrigine. The impaired consciousness episodes remained unaffected and were considered to be nonepileptic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine may worsen symptoms of comorbid idiopathic RBD.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Allostatic Overload Syndrome in Patients with Chronic Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "Allostasis, the ability to maintain stability through change, is a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. When allostatic systems are turned on and turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not otherwise survive. However, in a number of circumstances allostatic systems may either be overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has been termed 'allostatic load', or the price of adaptation [1]. Findings from several studies suggest that it is associated with worse health conditions and plays a significant role in the susceptibility, course, and outcome of cardiovascular (CV) diseases [2]. Recently, Fava et al. [3] introduced clinimetric criteria for assessing allostatic overload syndrome (AOS) based on: (a) current identifiable sources of distress in the form of acute or chronic stress (the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual's coping skills when its full nature and circumstances are evaluated), and (b) psychiatric symptoms (DSM-IV) or psychosomatic symptoms (DCPR) or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or in psychological well-being occurring within 6 months after the onset of the stressor.This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the AOS of Fava et al. [3] in patients with chronic CV disease and its relationships with psychosomatic syndromes (Structured Interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research; DCPR [4]), psychopathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; SCID [5]), illness representations (Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised; IPQ-R [6]), and psychosocial functioning (12-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-12 [7]). To evaluate AOS, recent and chronic stress, environmental mastery, sleep, somatization, and psychological distress were carefully evaluated in the clinical interview.Consecutive outpatients with essential hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled between January and December 2011. Patients with severe CV comorbidity, psychosis, oncology and autoimmune diseases, cognitive impairment, and current alcohol or any other substance abuse were excluded. For all patients, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure were recorded at the entry. All patients gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Because of refusal to participate, clinical problems, and other difficulties, 116 of 138 patients (84%) entered the study (84 with essential hypertension and 32 with CHD). The clinical characteristics and scale scores of patients with and without AOS are shown in table 1.No differences in CV and sociodemographic variables were found between the two groups, except for younger age in the AOS patients. Patients with AOS showed significant poorer mental functioning (SF-12 MCS), higher scores on the IPQ-R consequences (perception of severity and effects of the illness on individual life) and emotional representations (emotional reactivity to the illness) subscales, and a higher prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses. Furthermore, a 2-fold significant higher prevalence of DCPR clusters of abnormal illness behavior, irritability, and somatization (though the latter was near to statistical significance) was found in the AOS group compared to the comparison group. It is noteworthy that DCPR demoralization was more than 5-fold higher in AOS patients than in those without AOS. Also, the DCPR syndrome of illness denial was diagnosed 3 times more frequently in the AOS (31%) group than in the comparison (10%) group [χ2(1) = 4.82, p = 0.03]. Logistic regression analysis was used with AOS as the dependent variable and DSM and DCPR syndrome illness representation, psychosocial functioning, and sociodemographic characteristics as independent variables. The final model was statistically significant (χ2 = 31.46, p < 0.001; Cox and Snell R2 = 0.24) and AOS was found to be independently predicted by DCPR demoralization [B = 1.807 (SE 0.849); Wald statistic 4.530 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.03; Exp (B) = 6.090 (95% CI 1.154–32.153)] and SF-12 MCS [B = –0.099 (SE 0.040); Wald statistic 5.978 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.01; Exp (B) = 0.906 (95% CI 0.837–0.981)].In this exploratory study we showed for the first time, to our knowledge, the prevalence of AOS in outpatients with chronic CV illness. Within this sample, AOS is characterized by poorer psychosocial functioning, higher rates of psychopathology, and a higher disease-related emotional burden (perception of the impact of the illness on individual life) with associated correlates of abnormal illness behavior, somatization symptoms, and irritability. It is of interest that AOS partially and independently overlapped with demoralization, a feeling state characterized by an inability to cope with problems, hopelessness, and helplessness [8] which may dramatically increase the subjective perception of being overloaded by stressful demands, as shown by the association with the mental component score of SF-12. Recently, Offidani and Ruini [9] found a much higher prevalence of AOS (41%) compared to our results (11%). The marked difference with the report of Offidani and Ruini [9] might be likely due to a number of reasons including sampling (they recruited blood donors on a voluntary basis vs. consecutive CV outpatients), procedure (they recruited healthy volunteers who might be more interested in participating in a psychological evaluation because of experienced distress), age (they recruited younger subjects aged an average of 37 years while our patients had a mean age of 66), work status (more than half of their subjects were employed while two third of our subjects were retired, with a consequent different weight of work-related stress), and assessment instruments (they did not use SCID and DCPR but cut off criteria to self-report scales).Our study includes obvious limitations dues to its preliminary nature such as a limited sample size, cross-sectional design, lack of assessment of biological (e.g. erythrocites, leukocytes, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin), metabolic (waist-hip ratio), and behavioral (smoking status, diet, alcohol, and coffee consumption) data that are relevant for both CV illness and allostatic load. Nonetheless, our findings show that a reliable evaluation of allostatic overload may help to identify those conditions that, by exceeding individual resources, may constitute a danger to health such as demoralization. The relevance of diagnosing AOS is particularly important in cardiology because of the established association of chronic stress with negative prognostic factors. Furthermore, diagnosing AOS may help target treatment to psychological functions enhancing well-being outcomes [10].",

Hyperactive basomedial nuclei played the role of a primary pathological determinant which caused the complex of emotional and behavioural disorders.

The clinical picture of TGA is characterised by retrograde amnesia (spanning from several days to several years), anterograde amnesia (from few to several hours, most often from 4 to 8), significant disorientation with respect to time (about 50% of the patients) and place (above 90% patients), preserved auto-orientation and preserved ability to recognise other people. The onset of transient global amnesia is sudden and unpredictable. Memory impairments in TGA are unspecific and they are not limited to one single sense or to one given type of material. In TGA there is a lack of comorbid neurological symptoms. Among 10-20% patients after one TGA episode there is a possibility of a next one. Among the risk factors of transient global amnesia we can distinguish biological and psychological variables. The aim of the study is to present symptoms and aetiology of TGA and to show several neuropsychological methods which can be used in differential diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) affects 1% to 3% of global population, characterized by intrusive thoughts, known as obsessions, and repetitive actions, or compulsions [1]. The disorder can consume lot of time in daily activities and cause marked distress and functional impairment. The causes are multifactorial including cognitive, genetic and neural factors. The presentation of OCD in children and adults can be entirely different. Whereas, children usually present with obsessions of violence and magical thinking, adolescents and adults can have obsessions with contamination and sexual component. Past had seen nomenclatures like Schizo-obsession which are obsolete now. Having said that even today we see lot of patients with schizophrenia presenting co-morbidly with OCD. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by excessive restriction on food intake and irrational fear of gaining weight, often accompanied by a distorted body self -perception [2]. Eating disorders and schizophrenia are frequently comorbid and schizophrenia shares genetic susceptibility with anorexia. Genome-wide analysis of anorexia nervosa and major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia reveals genetic overlap and identifies novel risk loci for anorexia nervosa [3]. We are reporting an interesting case where both Anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder were subsequently found to be prodrome of Schizophrenia in 16-year-old girl.

      "title": "Some manoeuvres for releasing the hypertonus of spastic and shortened muscles.",
      "abstract": "We describe some physiotherapeutic techniques and manoeuvres releasing the increased tone of spastic and shortened muscles. The techniques can be generally characterised and summed up into three groups as follows: I. First types of manoeuvres consists in setting up the extremity or segment into the position usually opposed or antagonistic to the limited direction. This position is held for several tens of seconds. After this, partial of the originally limited range of motion could be observed. A modification of this approach is effective for persistent extensor spasticity of the lower extremities. Extremity is taken up into the internal rotation and flexion of the hip joint, into the maximal flexion of knee joint and into dorsiflexion of ankle joint, and this position is held at least for 30 seconds. After this, the extensor spasticity is usually diminished and also the voluntary movements and gait pattern improved. II. Short active jerk (not exceeding 1/2 sec) in the free direction, alternatively against mild resistance, followed by 3-4 second release and slow stretch into the restricted range. It is essentially important that the initial jerk is as brisk as possible but performed with no special effort. In case the resistance is applied, it should be only slight. Then the therapist must grasp a \"melting\" of the hypertonus and cautiously guide the segment into the slow and gentle stretch. III. Pressure stimulation of the particular active zones. The application of these manoeuvres and its combinations are demonstrated in case reports.",

Comparée à ces témoins du même âage, I'architecture du sommeil est, chez les dépressifs avant décalage, très perturbée avec, notamment, fragmentation et inefficacité du sommeil, réduction du taux de sommeil lent et raccourcissement de la latence du sommeil paradoxal. L'organisation temporelle semble traduire, elle, une lutte entre tendance au sommeil lent et tendance au sommeil paradoxal. Le sommeil des mêmes sujets s'est pratiquement normalisé pendant et surtout après le decalage des horaires de sommeil, exceptée la persistance de la réduction importante de la latence du sommeil paradoxal. Il serait ainsi possible d'associer la dépression à une désynchronisation entre rythmicités contrôlant sommeil lent, sommeil paradoxal et d'autres rythmes circadiens. Une resynchronisation forcée par décalage des horaires de sommeil pourrait alors rendre compte des améliorations cliniques et biologiques qui ont été observées.",

The mother says intrafamily difficulties. Information reported by the patient's mother confirms next visit also providing pictures on the wall of your room is returned. Referral to child and adolescent mental health is decided. Exploration/complementary tests There is no single test for pica. It is carried out systematic blood, biochemical (iron, zinc, lead…) to assess toxic substances and nutritional levels. Abdominal Rx. Both normal. Diagnosis Pica (F98.3). Differential diagnosis Ingestion of nutrients can occur in the course of other mental disorders (for example, a pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), mental retardation, in the Kleine–Levin syndrome… In these cases, should only be established an additional diagnosis of pica if the feeding behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Conclusions Pica disorder has been studied by pediatricians, gynecologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, anthropologists, etc., which has been interpreted as a conduct disorder, food, mental illness, poverty, hunger… but really the cause it is unknown. Although morbidity and mortality is unknown and difficult to study, include poisonings, parasitosis and surgical abdomen as serious complications.

We retrospectively investigated whether SDEEG is useful when REEG containing wakefulness and sleep fails to show ED. Subjects were patients with definite or highly probable epilepsy whose REEG lacked ED and who later underwent SDEEG. All had wakefulness and at least stage II sleep during both REEG and SDEEG. Patients with ED on REEG were specifically excluded to avoid including patients with activation due merely to the occurrence of sleep. Patient and EEG characteristics were studied, including duration of wakefulness and each sleep stage and timing and characteristics of ED. Fifteen of 29 patients(52%) had activation on SDEEG; exclusively during wakefulness in 1, exclusively during sleep in 6 and in both wakefulness and sleep in 8. Activation rates were not significantly different between wakefulness (9, 60%), stage I (11, 74%) and stage II (11, 74%). EEG characteristics were similar for REEG and SDEEG, except that total EEG duration and stage II sleep were longer in SDEEG than in REEG, which did not influence activation by a logistic regression model (p > 0.05). We conclude that sleep deprivation activates ED independent of the activating effects of sleep and therefore is useful in evaluation of suspected epilepsy even when REEG contains sleep.",

Nyeri kepala tegang primer paling sedikit harus mempunyai 2 dari karakteristik berikut: 1) lokasinya dua sisi, 2) terasa seperti ditekan atau diikat sekeliling kepala (tidak berdenyut), 3) dengan intensitas ringan sampai sedang, 4) tidak bertambah berat saat aktivitas rutin seperti: berjalan atau naik tangga. Tidak dijumpai sama sekali mual dan tumpah, dapat dijumpai sekali photophobia (takut sinar) atau phonophobia (takut suara). Nyeri kepala tegang kadang-kadang meluas ke tengkuk atau sebaliknya mulai dari tengkuk meluas ke kepala \r\nPada nyeri kepala tagang, puncak kepala seperti ditekan, sekeliling kepala seperti diikat. Hal ini disebabkan karena ketegangan berlebihan otot daerah dahi, otot belakang kepala, dan otot daerah pelipis. Otot-otot lain yang mengalami ketegangan pad a nyeri kepala tegang adalah otot yang berfungsi untuk menegakkan kepala. Tarikan otot berkepanjangan pada kulit tulang di daerah perlekatan otot yaitu pada tulang belakang kepala dapat menimbulkan proses peradangan yang berakitab juga timbulnya rasa nyeri di daerah tersebut. \r\nPada keadaan biasa otot-otot leher bagian belakang sudah dalam keadaan dengan tonus atau ketegangan otot tertentu untuk mempertahankan supaya kepala tetap tegak. Stres fisik karena posisi tertentu berakibat otot menjadi lelah dan teregang peregangan ini lewat kumparan otot akan menimbulkan secara refleks ketegangan otot yang akan semakin meningkat, dan dapat menjadi khronis. Pemicu lain nyeri kepala tegang primer adalah aspek psikis yang terkait dengan stres. Stres mental atau pun stres fisik setelah diterima pusat-pusat penganalisis sensorik di otak, diproyeksikan ke sistim limbik (pusat untuk emosi). Melalui jaras-jaras tertentu diproyeksikan lagi ke hipotalamus (sistem komando) yang akan meng-ekspresikannya lewat jalur otonom maupun kelenjar hormon dan jalur motorik. Nyeri kepala tegang primer umumnya dikeluhkan bersama keluhan lain yang menunjukkan hiperaktivitas otonom. Faktor pencetus penting pada nyeri kepala tegang baik faktor fisik, ataupun psikis. Di sinilah pemahaman mengenai anatomi dan fisiologi dibutuhkan, yaitu yang terkait dengan pekerjaan atau okupasi dan aktivitas fisik harian serta keadaan emosi yang mewarnai \r\nPengobatan nyeri kepala tegang primer mengacu pada keluhan pasien, hasil pemeriksaan fisik, dan adanya faktor-faktor pencetus. Obat ditujukan untuk relaksasi otot dan anti nyeri. Manipulasi fisik dapat untuk merilekskan otot juga, yaitu dengan pemanasan dan pemijatan otot. Faktor psikis tidak boleh dilupakan untuk dicoba diatasi.",

The Body systems that demonstrate symptoms when deprived of oxygen include the Respiratory or Pulmonary system, the Cardiovascular system (include the heart and vascular supply of blood via arteries and veins), the Neuro-Muscular systems (including the brain, nervous system, and muscles), the renal system and body fluids, the regulation of acid-base balance, and the gastrointestinal system [1]. A synthesis of physiological signs and symptoms demonstrated through various body organs as sources or contributing factors related to hypoxia or prolonged hypoxemia presented as a guide for evaluating oxygen need. There are many symptoms notable for oxygen deprivation and the symptoms may be subtle and occur over long periods of time or they may have a very acute or abrupt disruption of circulation or blood flow that is of immediate concern and life threatening. This article will discuss the physiology and symptomatology of oxygen deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Summary Biological signals are often used as a tool for the control and evaluation of the training loads or for the evaluation of the acute and chronic eff ects in the organism of athletes. The Heart Rate is still considered nowadays as the most popular of load indicators among athletes and coaches. Every single individual, in rest conditions, has a natural rhythm but unlike we might think, is far from stable. This is an exceptional circumstance for the application in the athletic training. These variations are known as Heart Rate Variability. The Heart Rate depends directly on autonomic or vegetative nervous system. In turn, it infl uences on several functions of the organism, training loads evaluation and in the acute and chronic eff ects produced in the organism of the athlete. The control of this parameter depends on a high number of factors, internals and externals, which vary signifi cantly throughout the exercise time or in situations where the body alters normal operating situation. Thus, we can observe that during exercise the sympathetic -vagal balance is dependent of the intensity and duration of the exercise. Some authors suggest that up 50% VO 2max approximately, HRV changes are mainly due to the decreased parasympathetic discharge accompanied by a progressive increase of the sympathetic infl uence. Above this intensity, HR and its oscillations are primarily infl uenced by sympathetic activity. In these situations, HR oscillations are also dependents of two oscillatory processes which work as feedback mechanism: breathing (Respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and blood pressure (barorefl ex infl uence). These mechanisms, assessment, methodology and control tools are the issues we will discuss in this review. Palabras clave: Variabilidad de la frecuencia cardiaca. Ejercicio. Wavelet transform.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

      "title": "PTSD in the Context of Malignant Disease",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "title": "Got Stress? You May Be Harming Your Brain",
      "abstract": "Stress, is a concept that is borrowed from engineering and when too great a stress load is placed on a lawyer, he or she can suffer from damage or even collapse. Acute stress is short-lived and the body reacts to it by mobilizing resources to deal with intellectual or physical challenges. Chronic stress is long-lasting, persisting for many days or months, and results in serious physical and mental symptoms. The human response to stress is to engage the fight-or-flight system ensuring survival. This response was meant to address acute stress, lasting for short periods, to manage immediate predator threats. The endocrine system releases the stress hormones adrenalin and glucocorticoids (the preeminent glucocorticoid is cortisol), which elevate heart rate and blood pressure, slow digestion, and suppress immune responses. Chronic stress causes a lengthy stress response and the lawyer body and brain suffer.Long-term elevated levels of stress hormones can cause impaired immune response, increased appetite, decreased muscle mass, and increased mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and depression. If a lawyer spends too much time in fight-or-flight overdrive, his or her cognitive performance can also be impaired. Sitting deep in the lawyer brain and shaped like a pair of horns, one in the left hemisphere and one in the right, is the brain’s memory processor. The hippocampus is critical to the work of lawyers because it processes client facts, statutes, cases, and regulations, and facilitates their transfer into long-term memory. The hippocampus is one of a few places in the brain that can grow new brain cells in a process called neurogenesis. And it is extremely sensitive to stress.The impact of stress on cognition includes deterioration in memory, concentration, problem-solving, and language processing. Curiosity, creativity, and motivation are also diminished. These cognitive problems are likely due to stress hormones, which suppress neurogenesis, and cause neurodegeneration and cell death in the hippocampus. And the brain cells that remain do not function as well. Research using brain scans shows that hippocampi shrink in size in people who experience post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and repeated jet lag. There is some good news about stress and brain health. Neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the growth of new brain cells and the development of new brain networks, allow for healing the stressed lawyer brain. The prescription for optimal brain health is a combination of aerobic exercise, adequate sleep, and restorative practices. Any exercise that raises the lawyer’s heart rate increases blood and oxygen flow to the brain; elevates key neurotransmitters; and produces a brain cell building block called Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor. Research indicates that any amount of aerobic exercise improves brain function, but the more fit the body, the greater the brain resilience and cognitive capacity. Sufficient sleep is critical for consolidating memories, which happens largely during REM sleep cycles. Restorative practices such as mindfulness, meditation, gratitude, and yoga strengthen the rest-and-digest system and calm the fight-or-flight response. These practices can lower heart rate and blood pressure, improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and reduce stress hormone levels.Lawyers know they need to take care of their physical health, but they also need to cultivate brain health. The brain-boosting benefits of exercise, adequate sleep, and restorative practices can rehabilitate the stressed lawyer brain.",

The present factor analytic study examines 35 distinct depressive symptoms in three depressed samples and supports the conceptualization of D. F. Klein (Endomorphic depression. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 31: 447–454, 1974) that endogeneity and reactivity can be construed as orthogonal, independent dimensions. Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2) showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsibilities; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at \"end of rope\"; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity. The results suggest a methodology for identifying depressives who are high-high, low-high, high-low, and low-low on the endogeneity and reactivity factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

      "title": "Case Report: Mental Confusion, Diplopia, and Inability to Stand in an 82‐Year‐Old‐Man",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine. Alcoholics account for most of the cases, but patients with malnutrition due to hyperemesis, vomiting, starvation, renal dialysis, parenteral nutrition, and cancer are also at risk; in this group of patients WE is often underrecognized.1, 2 In a recent retrospective study based on autopsy, alcoholism was present only in 50% of cases, and nonalcoholic subjects had a clinical history of malnutrition, gastroplasty, and neoplasia.3 The characteristic clinical triad is that of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and global confusion, and the diagnosis is based on anamnesis, clinical examination, laboratory tests (dosage of pyruvate and transketolase), and on neuroimaging.4 WE is usually associated with other manifestations of nutritional disease, such as polyneuropathy, or with manifestations related to the coexistence of cardiovascular (wet) beriberi, such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, and edema of the legs. Rarely do amblyopia or spinal spastic ataxia occur. WE is a medical emergency, and mortality in the acute phase is about 17%. Response to treatment with thiamine is dramatic, but a syndrome characterized by gaps in memory, confabulation, and disordered temporal sequencing is frequently persistent (e.g., Korsakoff's psychosis). An 82-year-old man was referred to us because of mental confusion, diplopia, and his inability to stand for 2 days. The patient's medical history included ankylopoietic spondylosis treated with sulfasalazine, hypertension, and some recent transient ischemic attacks. The patient was not an alcoholic and during the prior week had suffered from hyperemesis and vomiting. The clinical examination showed inability to stand, convergent strabismus due to deficit of the sixth left cranial nerve, horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze, ataxia, absence of patellar reflexes, edema of the legs, tachycardia, and hypotension (85/60 mmHg). The blood gas analysis showed lactic acidosis.5 Suspecting an acute stroke of the brainstem,6 a cerebral computed tomography (showing vascular encephalopathy and periventricular rarefaction of the white matter) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. This latter examination showed lesions of the mamillary bodies, the periaqueductal thalamic regions, and the cerebellar vermis, indicative of WE. An electromyography showed the presence of polyneuropathy. On this basis, a thiamine dose of 100 mg was administrated intramuscularly, with dramatic improvement; vigilance normalized, strabismus and diplopia recovered, and arterial pressure and heart rate normalized. During the following days, there was continuous improvement in clinical conditions, even though the patient remained mildly confused and confabulating. The ataxia disappeared, but inability to stand and walk still persisted. The MRI scan showed a reduction in the number and extension of the lesions of the brainstem.7 The patient began physical therapy with poor results; he was alert but could not stand without help and walk, probably because of the associated irreversible polyneuropathy. In conclusion, WE should always be suspected in the elderly with malnutrition, disorders of ocular motility, and alteration of consciousness, even without a clinical history of alcoholism. The coexistence of cardiovascular symptoms or signs of lactic acidosis may be of help in the diagnosis of the disease. Administration of thiamine dramatically improves the clinical condition,8 confirming the diagnostic hypothesis. Thus it should be of utmost importance, in cases of patients with inexplicable stupor or coma, to immediately start treatment with thiamine, while waiting for the results of laboratory tests and neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "Veel mensen in onze samenleving leiden aan regelmatige slaapproblemen of hebben gewoonweg niet voldoende tijd voor slaap. Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

      "title": "Insomnia and its Ayurveda Management– A Critical Review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the basic and vital necessities of the body. Sleep is a normal biological process that provides the body (Sharir) and intellect (Mann) enough rest. Because of this, Ayurveda emphasises the importance of sleep, referring to it as Trayoupasthambh (Ahara-dietary habits, Nidra-sleep pattern, and Brahrnacharya-celibacy), (three support pillars). According to the text, Dhatu Samyata (the balance of the body constituents) depends on sleep. Particularly, the state of one's food and sleep affects obesity and emaciation. A careful review of the Ayurvedic medical literature reveals that increased Vata, old age, habit, and indulgence in work are the main causes of the Anidra (sleeplessness). This condition is also a consequence of a variety of diseases, and a number of ailments are caused and aggravated by inadequate sleep. In Ayurvedic literature, terms for insomnia include Anidra, Nidranasha, and Asvapna. Insomnia is a sleep disorder where people experience difficulty in sleeping or inadequate, poor-quality sleep. They may have trouble falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night with difficulty returning to sleep, and waking up too early in the morning. However, insufficient sleep increases the risk of numerous lifestyle-related diseases and impairs working capacity and concentration. Therefore the current article discusses the causes, effects, and treatment options for insomnia from an Ayurvedic perspective.",

      "abstract": "by evidence of early histological damage, functional alterations, and signs and symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are prominent features of the radiation syndrome. In considering the nature of the altered physiology of the gastrointestinal tract produced by radiation, one is dealing with a very complicated system of the body. Digestion and absorption of food are complex and poorly understood. Symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract are reflected via a complex system of nervous control through the autonomic sympathetics and parasympathetics. To complicate matters further, the gut has an enteric nervous system of its own which allows for autonomous movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms may stem from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract itself, from diseases of other parts of the body via complex nerve pathways, from impulses arising in the central nervous system, or from a combination of these sources. Gastrointestinal symptoms of central origin are frequent and complex in character. Such complexity is exemplified in the phenomenon of vomiting which may be produced by the sight of blood, extreme fear, or a shocking experience. Other gastrointestinal functional disturbances of a more chronic nature may result from psychic imbalance. It is often difficult to distinguish between organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and functional disturbances which are purely psychic in origin. In addition, disturbances of central origin are said to be produced by toxins affecting the vomiting and other higher centers. Many acute infectious diseases are ushered in with gastrointestinal symptoms which are believed to be due to central toxic as well as local effects. Disease or trauma of other viscera or parts of the body may produce gastrointestinal symptoms by reflex mechanisms through the central nervous system. Very little is yet known about the part the afferent and efferent nervous elements play in the symptomatology related to radiation injury of the gastrointestinal tract.",

      "title": "Primary visual cortex excitability is not atypical in acquired synaesthesia",
      "abstract": "•We report a case of acquired synaesthesia (LW) following 2C–B use.•We tested the prediction that LW would display primary visual cortex hyperexcitability.•TMS motor and phosphene thresholds were measured in LW and controls.•In contrast with our prediction, LW did not display an atypical phosphene threshold. Synaesthesia is a condition wherein stimulation of one modality automatically and consistently triggers activation of a secondary concurrent experience in a separate modality [[1]Ward J. Synesthesia.Annu Rev Psychol. 2013; 64: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar]. Although it is typically viewed as a healthy neurodevelopmental condition with idiosyncratic inducer-concurrent associations that manifest in childhood, recent evidence suggests that synaesthesia-like experiences can be temporarily induced via consumption of recreational drugs, particularly serotonin receptor agonists (e.g., LSD, psilocybin) [[2]Luke D. Terhune D.B. The induction of synaesthesia with chemical agents: a systematic review.Front Psychol. 2013; 4Crossref Google Scholar]. Nevertheless, whether such experiences constitute a genuine form of synaesthesia remains controversial since drug-induced synaesthesias do not meet behavioural diagnostic criteria for developmental synaesthesia [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. One interpretation of these phenomenological-behavioural discrepancies is that drug-induced synaesthesias do not meet such criteria because inducer-concurrent associations must undergo a process of consolidation before they achieve the level of automaticity and consistency characteristic of developmental synaesthesia [[4]Terhune D.B. Luke D.P. Kaelen M. Bolstridge M. Feilding A. Nutt D. et al.A placebo-controlled investigation of synaesthesia-like experiences under LSD.Neuropsychologia. 2016; 88: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. We recently reported evidence in support of this hypothesis with a case of acquired synaesthesia (LW) following use of the recreational partial serotonin receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C–B; [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]). LW has reported multiple forms of synaesthesia for over 9 years since ingesting 70–150mg of 2C–B, which is approximately 3–12 times the normal dosage [[5]Johnson M.P. Mathis C.A. Shulgin A.T. Hoffman A.J. Nichols D.E. [125I]-2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)aminoethane ([125I]-2C-I) as a label for the 5-HT2 receptor in rat frontal cortex.Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1990; 35: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar]. Using standardized measures, we corroborated that one or more of LW's multiple forms of synaesthesia exhibited either consistency or automaticity, thereby meeting diagnostic criteria for this condition [[1]Ward J. Synesthesia.Annu Rev Psychol. 2013; 64: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar]. Despite these results, it remains unclear whether acquired synaesthesia shares overlapping neural mechanisms with developmental synaesthesia. It was recently proposed that drug-induced synaesthesia results from serotonin cascades triggering elevated cortical excitability in layer V pyramidal neurons, resulting in anomalous perceptual states that are mapped onto inducers, yielding synaesthetic experiences [[6]Brogaard B. Serotonergic hyperactivity as a potential factor in developmental, Acquired and drug-induced synesthesia.Front Hum Neurosci. 2013; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. This hypothesis is consistent with research showing selective hyperexcitability in primary visual cortex, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) phosphene thresholds, but not motor (control) thresholds, in developmental synaesthesia [[7]Terhune D.B. Murray E. Near J. Stagg C.J. Cowey A. Cohen Kadosh R. Phosphene perception relates to visual cortex glutamate levels and covaries with atypical visuospatial awareness.Cerebr Cortex. 2015; 25: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar] and after synaesthesia training in controls [[8]Rothen N. Schwartzman D.J. Bor D. Seth A.K. Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations.Neuropsychologia. 2018; 111: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. If cortical hyperexcitability plays a role in induced synaesthesias, individuals with acquired synaesthesia will display selectively lower phosphene thresholds similar to developmental synaesthetes. The present study sought to test this prediction in LW using a double-blind design and standardized TMS protocols. LW (31 years old, male) and 29 non-synaesthete controls (17 females, 12 males, MAge = 25.32, SD = 4.45) provided informed written consent to participate in this study in accordance with local ethical approval. LW did not significantly differ in age from controls, t = 1.25, p = .11, Zcc = 1.28 [0.83, 1.57] with a probability of occurrence in the general population of pgp = 11% [7, 21]. None of the participants displayed contraindications for non-invasive brain stimulation and there were no adverse events. Phosphene and motor threshold estimation followed established TMS protocols [[9]Abrahamyan A. Clifford C.W.G. Ruzzoli M. Phillips D. Arabzadeh E. Harris J.A. Accurate and rapid estimation of phosphene thresholds (REPT).PLoS One. 2011; 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,[10]Badran B.W. DeVries W.H. Glusman C.E. Willis A. Pridmore S. et al.Are EMG and visual observation comparable in determining resting motor threshold? A reexamination after twenty years.Brain Stimulation. 2019; 12: 364-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar] (see Supplementary Materials). After identification of suitable stimulation sites, single-pulse TMS was applied to left primary motor cortex (motor thresholds) and midline primary visual cortex (phosphene thresholds) in counterbalanced order. For motor threshold estimation, participants rested their right hand on a table, with their forefinger and thumb touching and attended to the interosseous muscle. After stimulation to primary motor cortex with the coil positioned at a 45° postero-lateral angle, they reported whether they observed a visible twitch of the interosseous muscle during the stimulation. For phosphene threshold estimation, participants were first dark-adjusted and then sat with their eyes open at a 1 m distance from a large, non-reflective black curtain (3 × 3 m). After each stimulation with the TMS handle and coil in the vertical position, participants reported whether they had experienced a phosphene. Stimulation intensity varied on a trial-by-trial basis according to individual participants' reports, as determined by a Bayesian adaptive staircase procedure with 30 trials run on each site in order to estimate 60% thresholds for both motor and phosphene thresholds [[9]Abrahamyan A. Clifford C.W.G. Ruzzoli M. Phillips D. Arabzadeh E. Harris J.A. Accurate and rapid estimation of phosphene thresholds (REPT).PLoS One. 2011; 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar]. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in contrast to our central prediction, LW did not display a significantly lower TMS phosphene threshold (61) than controls, M = 63.38, SD = 9.49, t = 0.25, p = .60, Zcc = 0.25 [0.13, 0.58], with a probability of occurrence in the general population of pgp = 60% [45, 72]. LW displayed a marginally higher motor threshold, 72 (corresponding to the highest threshold in controls), than controls, M = 56.52, SD = 7.51, t = 2.03, p = .026, Zcc = 2.06 [1.70, 2.41], pgp = 3% [1, 5], and a marginally greater threshold difference (motor-phosphene), 11, relative to the controls, −6.86, SD = 10.28, t = 1.71, p = .049, Zcc = 1.74 [1.37, 2.09] with a probability of occurrence of 5% [2, 9]. We tested the prediction that a case of acquired synaesthesia would be characterized by selective hyperexcitability in primary visual cortex, as observed in developmental synaesthesia [[7]Terhune D.B. Murray E. Near J. Stagg C.J. Cowey A. Cohen Kadosh R. Phosphene perception relates to visual cortex glutamate levels and covaries with atypical visuospatial awareness.Cerebr Cortex. 2015; 25: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar] and induced synaesthesia [[8]Rothen N. Schwartzman D.J. Bor D. Seth A.K. Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations.Neuropsychologia. 2018; 111: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. In contrast with this prediction, we found that LW, an acquired synaesthete with previously-demonstrated inducer-concurrent automaticity and consistency [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar], displayed typical TMS phosphene thresholds that were within 25% of a SD of the mean phosphene threshold in controls. We did observe a tendency for LW to display marginally greater motor thresholds than controls, but this effect was unpredicted and should be interpreted with caution. These results suggest that LW does not exhibit primary visual cortex hyperexcitability and are at odds with the broader hypothesis of a role for cortical excitability in drug-induced synaesthesia [[6]Brogaard B. Serotonergic hyperactivity as a potential factor in developmental, Acquired and drug-induced synesthesia.Front Hum Neurosci. 2013; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. One interpretation of these results is that atypical cortical hyperexcitability will only be observed in acquired synaesthesia further downstream in visual cortex, such as V4.

      "abstract": "What is the best available evidence regarding pharmacologic treatments used to relieve nonspecific fatigue in people with advanced disease?\r\nType of Review\r\nA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same substance could be analyzed in a subpopulation of participants (i.e., with the same illness).\r\nRelevance to Nursing\r\nFatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in individuals who have cancer and also is highly prevalent in populations with progressive life-threatening conditions. Fatigue presents a challenge for healthcare professionals because it can be nonspecific to treatment or illness, ongoing, subjective, and disabling to patients. In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Motility-like dyspepsia, a clinical subgroup of functional dyspepsia, refers to the cluster of symptoms which suggests an underlying motility disturbance of the upper gut. Characteristic symptoms, in addition to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, are nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, postprandial abdominal bloating and excessive repetitive postprandial belching. Patients with concomitant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are currently excluded from this clinical entity. Delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids, postprandial antral hypomotility and antroduodenal incoordination, gastric myoelectrical arrhythmias and dysfunction of visceral afferents are the major alterations in upper gut sensorimotor activity which have been described. An empirical trial of medical therapy is warranted if there are no “alarm” symptoms at presentation. If symptoms are not relieved after 2-4 weeks, then investigations of the upper gastrointestinal tract, preferably by endoscopy, to exclude the presence of organic disease, is advisable. Management approaches are then reassurance, dietary manipulations and attention to psychosocial aspects. Prokinetic agents appear to be useful as short-term medical therapy in some patients, but optimum long-term treatment strategies, including the use of medications which may improve a diminished tolerance to gut distension, are not established.",

      "abstract": "DISORDERS that simultaneously involve several organ systems can produce confusing clinical pictures, and the combination of oronasal bleeding, visual impairment, and altered sensorium is particularly striking in this regard. Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is more commonly known as bed-wetting. Enuresis is diagnosed when children repeatedly urinate in inappropriate places, such as clothing (during the day) or the bed (during the night). In most cases, the child’s urination problem is involuntary in nature, and is perceived by the child as an unavoidable loss of urinary control. This condition is most likely a symptom of psychological stress, although physiological causes, such as bladder infection, should not be ruled out. In general, the causes of bedwetting are related to anxiety, life stress, and possibly trauma, both inside and outside the home. Psychological factors such as a stressful life situation (death of a parent) or birth of a new sibling, disturbed family patterns, and delay toilet training, personality characteristics, parenting style, anxiety or presence of other emotional problems may predispose factors of enuresis. Many Children with enuresis experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic, or everyday lives and the disorder can also drastically affect their families. The aim of the study is to find out the Anxiety level of Enuretic and Non-Enuretic Children.Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) questionnaire made by A. kumar to determine anxiety level administered over 80 (Boys and girls) children of enuretic and non-enuretic.

      "abstract": "Swallow syncope is a rare dysautonomic syndrome characterized by temporary loss of consciousness upon swallowing solid foods or liquids, displaying primarily in individuals with an underlying structural or functional esophageal or cardiac pathology. However, the evidence also suggests that isolated vagal dysfunction or abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors after mechanical irritation, demyelination, or trauma can potentially evoke a cardioinhibitory response or vasodepression upon swallowing. We present a case of a 49-year-old otherwise healthy female patient who developed swallow syncope two weeks after whiplash neck injury acquired in a rear-end collision. After no evident anatomical and/or functional cardiac or esophageal pathology was diagnosed using several diagnostic procedures, the final diagnosis was confirmed by a provocative tilt-table test while ingesting solid food. Subsequently, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, relieving the patient from troublesome symptoms. Abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors to stimuli associated with food ingestion and/or dysfunction of afferent and efferent vagal fibers due to stretch injury and related neck trauma (acquired during the car accident) may be the leading pathophysiological mechanisms of swallow syncope in our patient.",

Delta or slow wave sleep is characterized by high voltage, slow waves. The increasing presence of large delta waves indicates the onset of delta sleep. Waking the sleeper is most difficult at this time; hence, delta sleep is considered the deepest stage of sleep. The physiology of the body during rapid eye movement (REM) is quite different from that during non- REM (NREM). The stages of sleep in the average young adult show a fairly regular cyclic alteration. Environmental influences such as daylight, traffic noises, and the activity of other people tend to make prolonged sleep more difficult.

      "title": "Brain Trust",
      "abstract": "transient global anemia: transient global anemiaFigureImagine you are crewing a race boat, and in the middle of a gnarly wave, you become cognitively unresponsive but otherwise completely functional. (Cogn Behav Neurol 2017;30[1]:1.) Is this possible? Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a diagnosis that can actually be associated with a person forgetting recent memories and unable to create new ones. Fisher and Adams first described the syndrome in 1964 (Trans Am Neurol Assoc 1958;83:143), and Hodges and Warlow established the following diagnostic criteria (Brain 1990;113[Pt 3]:639): Episode witnessed by an observer Anterograde amnesia during the episode Clouding of consciousness and loss of personal identity without other neurobehavioral deficits No other focal neurologic signs during or after the attack No evidence of seizure Resolution within 24 hours No recent head injury or active seizure disorder Aside from the trouble it may cause for you trying to explain to your spouse where you have been, it's not the worst diagnosis to have—it is self-limiting and there are no permanent sequelae. Interestingly, those reporting TGA have been able to carry on with cognitive and motor activities during the episode without a hitch. They simply become very confused, disoriented, and perseverative, with amnesia to recent events but intact memory for the longer term. The onset is usually fairly rapid, and an episode typically lasts two to eight hours. This is a pretty rare disease, occurring in only two to 10 people per 100,000, and some even loosely compare it with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. TGA is a cerebral reaction to an acute stress episode, while takotsubo is a cardiac reaction to acute stress. (J Neurol Sci 2017;376:196.) We generally function with three types of memory: immediate, short-term, and long-term. Immediate or working memory helps you remember a phone number for the pizza place that was just read to you. This is stored in the superior frontal cortex. Short-term or episodic memory requires hippocampus and parahippocampal area functions in the medial temporal lobe. It will help you remember that you were given that phone number because you are supposed to pick up a pizza with anchovies and artichokes on the way home. Long-term or remote memory will enable you to remember where you live to get that pizza home. This memory function resides in the visual association cortex, temporal cortex, and other cortical areas, depending on the type of memory. Mysterious but Harmless The pathophysiology of TGA has yet to be worked out; theories include venous congestion, arterial ischemia, migraine, or epilepsy. Experimental compression of the brachiocephalic vein has demonstrated retrograde flow in the venous system backing up all the way to the basilar plexus, which is associated with the mesial temporal region that is responsible for short-term memories. (Neurology 2006;66[12]:1873.) This, in addition to the discovery that many patients with TGA have incompetent internal jugular vein valves, supports the venous congestion and ischemia theory of why TGA occurs. But this theory fails because incompetent valves are permanent features, and TGA tends to occur only once per patient with a low rate of recurrence (2-25%). Several pre-attack occurrences have been associated with TGA, including physical exertion, events associated with water, sexual activity, use of marijuana, Viagra, and valsalva maneuvers, but none has been proven to be causal or explain the phenomenon. Other causes of transient amnesia must be ruled out when considering TGA, such as epileptic seizures, transient ischemia of the posterior cerebral artery, migraine headache, benzodiazepine, zolpidem intoxication, and alcoholic blackouts or a dissociative fugue state. Transient epileptic amnesia should also be considered. This rare form of epilepsy is characterized by recurrent transient episodes of isolated memory loss. It is different from partial complex seizures in that it typically has no other neurologic characteristics such as aura or postictal state. The treatment of TGA is simply supportive, monitoring the patients while their memory returns. ECG or EEG may be useful, as are basic labs such as glucose, sodium, and toxins. CT or MRI are typically performed, but have low yield. The most useful therapy is reassuring the patient and family because TGA can be unsettling. The next time somebody wants to convince you that he has lost his memory, don't forget about amnesia. But check the back seat for that pizza.",

      "title": "Epilepsy: Treatment Options.",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "title": "What Do Patients Want in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder? Taiwan’s TAILOR Survey",
      "abstract": "In Taiwan, the number of patients being treated for depression has been increasing over recent decades, but there remain some key unmet needs for these patients. One issue is the low rate of help-seeking, which may be at least partially attributable to the stigma of depression in Asian societies. Stigma also contributes to underdiagnosis, because stigmatised patients may emphasise somatic symptoms (e.g. lethargy/fatigue, sleep disorders or changes in appetite), fearing how they will be perceived if they discuss psychological symptoms with their physician. Underdiagnosis may also result from cross-cultural differences, because assessment scales and screening tools are usually developed in Western populations and may not have the same validity in Asian patients. Depression in Taiwan appears to be undertreated, with a high rate of suboptimal antidepressant dosages and inadequate duration of therapy. Patients may discontinue treatment earlier than recommended for a number of reasons related to their own beliefs about treatment, their relationship with their physicians, or the effects of the medication (adverse effects, slow onset of effect, or lack of effect on comorbid symptoms). Moreover, frequently there is discordance between how patients and physicians define treatment success in depression. Patients are more likely to achieve a benefit from treatment which remains persistent when physicians and patients are closely aligned on treatment goals. To better understand the experiences, preferences and attitudes of patients with depression in Taiwan, the Target Antidepressant Initiation choice to unLock positive patient Outcomes and Response (TAILOR) survey was conducted in 340 adult outpatients receiving treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of the TAILOR survey highlight the personal and perceived stigma of depression, current barriers to seeking help and maintaining treatment, and opportunities to improve shared decision-making, medication adherence and clinical outcomes for Taiwanese patients with MDD.",

      "title": "New Daily Persistent Headache",
      "abstract": "One day, on a particular remembered day, out of the blue, a headache starts. Then, the headache stays, and nothing seems to make it go away. After going to the doctor, maybe many doctors, no cause is found. This is how New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH) begins. Sometimes there has been a cold or brief viral illness before the headache starts, and sometimes there is a seemingly unrelated stressful life event, but often there is no logical reason for the headache to begin so suddenly, or for it to stay. Frequently, the person can remember the exact day the NDPH started. Often, there is no previous history of headaches. About 50% of those with NDPH have migraine features such as light and noise sensitivity, or nausea. Or, the headache may be more similar to a tension-type headache, mild, two-sided, and not pounding. There is no difference in the likelihood of improvement between those with NDPH with migraine features compared to those with tension-type NDPH. The diagnosis of NDPH requires that the headache persist for 3 months without stopping, and it must not be caused by another medical problem. NDPH can occur at any age from childhood on, even into the 70s. The average age of onset is about 35. It is two to three times more common in women than men. Almost half of those with NDPH have a close relative with frequent headaches. Up to 30% of individuals have had a cold or flu-like illness before the start of the headache, about 10% recall a stressful life event beforehand, and about the same number had some surgery involving the head (but not brain surgery). That leaves at least 50% of individuals recalling no triggering event. Many headaches that are not NDPH have a similar abrupt onset, and sometimes sudden headaches can be dangerous. An onset of headache like a thunderclap in a storm can signal bleeding in the brain, a leak in cerebrospinal fluid, an infection, cancer, or unidentified trauma causing damage to the brain tissue. Uncommonly, untreated sinusitis or even severe high blood pressure can cause a continuous headache. However, if a headache continues for 3 months, with a completely normal examination, the likelihood of abnormal testing is low. Blood testing should be performed with the new onset of continuous headache looking for anemia or an increase or decrease in white blood cells or platelets, the blood cells that help blood to clot. Further blood testing should make sure that the body's chemistry is normal, and that the kidneys and liver are functioning as they should. Imaging of the head, such as a CAT scan (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI of the arteries (MRA), and MRI of the veins (MRV) are ordered to make sure nothing is missed. A measure of spinal fluid pressure may be performed by placing a small needle in the back, a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap. The neck may be examined to make sure there is no compression of the nerves resulting in an ongoing headache. The blood vessels that supply the brain may also be checked to make sure there is no interruption in flow. In individuals older than 50, a blood erythrocyte rate (ESR) is drawn, and there may be a biopsy of the arteries at the temples if the ESR is elevated. The tests chosen depend on the person, the history of the headaches, as well as the examination. When evaluating NDPH, it is important to make sure that the daily headache is not the result of medication overuse, which can also result in daily headache. If a person is using pain medications of any kind, including over the counter pills, more than 2 days per week, the diagnosis of NDPH cannot be made until this overuse of medication stops. Still, it is hard to figure out how medication overuse would start daily, continuous headache on a particular day. Although we recommend keeping as-needed medication use to less than 3 days per week, it is not clear that this intervention helps with NDPH. People with NDPH want to know what will work to treat it, and when it will stop. Unfortunately, there is no definite answer to either question. There are two types of NDPH, the kind that goes away, and another sort that remains ongoing with or without treatment for a longer period of time, without a predictable end point. Outcome predictions vary. Some evaluations suggest that most people with NDPH will be headache free in 3 years. However, one series of 79 patients with NDPH reported that around 75% of them continued to have daily headache at 5 years, and in some the headaches do persist indefinitely. NDPH does not have known treatment or medicine that cures it. In the previous description of 79 NDPH patients, 10 patients had their headaches go away while taking a preventive medication. Six of these lucky patients had their NDPH go away while on nortriptyline, and 4 of the 10 were taking topiramate. Perhaps the reasonable course is a combination of living a healthy lifestyle with exercise, good diet, and regular sleep, coupled with preventive medicines typically used for other headache disorders, including blood pressure medications such as propranolol or candesartan, antidepressants that target pain receptors such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or venlafaxine, or antiseizure medications such as topiramate, or use of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). Biofeedback, behavioral treatment, and relaxation therapy may also be of benefit. The most challenging problems with NDPH come from getting to the diagnosis, and even with the diagnosis, the absence of a good proven treatment. The best results are likely to come from a blended approach. Most people who have NDPH are able to lead a normal life, with eventual improvement or effective management of their daily headache.

Ada 6 jurnal yang menyatakan sikap berdiri lama berhubungan signifikan dengan NPB, namun 2 jurnal lainnya menyatakan sebaliknya. Sikap berdiri lama yang melebihi 20 menit dapat memberikan stress pada otot posterior tubuh dan persendian columna vertebralis, terutama di regio lumbal yang dapat menimbulkan keluhan NPB dengan tingkat dan kualitas nyeri yang bervariasi. Adanya faktor pekerjaan seperti beban kerja, lama kerja, sikap kerja, bantuan alat, dan banyaknya jam istirahat, serta faktor personal, seperti usia, merokok, jenis kelamin dan IMT, dapat ikut mempengaruhi kemunculan NPB pada seseorang, sehingga seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja yang lebih lama beresiko lebih besar mengalami keluhan NPB daripada seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja baru.

      "title": "Slow-wave sleep deficiency and enhancement: Implications for insomnia and its management",
      "abstract": "In humans, slow-wave sleep (SWS) consists of stages 3 and 4 of non rapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep. The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA. Some compounds have been shown to enhance SWS and SWA in healthy volunteers through GAT-1 inhibition, GABA-A modulation, GABA-B modulation, and 5HT2(A) antagonism. Pharmacological enhancement of SWS has also been observed in insomnia. The effects of SWS enhancement on other sleep parameters will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Joseph C Wu, Blynn G Bunney, Steven G PotkinThe identification of mechanisms associated with the rapid (within 24 hours) and often robust antidepressant actions of sleep deprivation could poten - tially revolutionize the understanding, prevention, and treatment of depression. Sleep deprivation studies have been conducted for more than 45 years,1 and despite the wide range of protocols (e.g., differing environmental settings, inpatient versus outpatient studies, diagnoses, gender, age, and medications), it is effective in an estimated 40-50% of depressed patients.2 Further, the improvement in depressive symptoms (significant reductions on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HDRS) that can occur within several hours of sleep deprivation are comparable to long-term (2-6 weeks) treatment with conventional anti - depressant medications.3 The evidence that sleep deprivation is effective even in chronic treatmentresistant patients (albeit at lower rates than non-refractory patients)4,5 may imply that it temporarily reverses some fundamental abnormality in depression. On the downside, recovery sleep (even short naps) precipitates relapse in approximately 80% of responders,2,6-9 suggesting that it also affects these same networks. Analyses of recovery sleep architecture (e.g., cumulative sleep time, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep density) fail to account for the relapse.2 Circadian factors are likely involved, as evidence suggests that recovery sleep in the morninghours is more detrimental than sleep at other times of the day in some7,9,10 but not all11 responders. A longitudinal electroencephalographic (EEG) study conducted over a period of 60 hours showed that some patients have repeated periods of microsleep (20 seconds). It was found that an accumulation of these episodes, particularly in the morning hours, is associated with a greater number of postsleep deprivation relapses.9 An ongoing challenge and a focus of current research is the identification of mechanisms to extend the rapid antidepressant responses of sleep deprivation by counteracting the apparent depressiogenic mechanisms associated with recovery sleep.",

A falha na memória é uma das queixas mais recorrentes nesta faixa etária, podendo ser consequência de uma série de fatores, dentre eles a depressão e o declínio cognitivo leve (DCL). A avaliação neuropsicológica pode ser utilizada como ferramenta para auxiliar na confirmação de quadros diagnósticos, diferenciando sintomas cognitivos e psiquiátricos. Explorar as dificuldades do diagnóstico diferencial entre a depressão e o declínio cognitivo na pessoa idosa. Estudo de caso único realizado a partir de uma avaliação neuropsicológica com uma idosa de 72 anos com queixa de falhas na memória. Verificou-se que a examinanda não apresentava dificuldades cognitivas proeminentes no momento da avaliação nem dificuldades significativas em suas atividades de vida diária: residia sozinha, fazia as compras da casa, realizava o pagamento das contas sem auxílio e utilizava o transporte público para se deslocar, evidenciando capacidade funcional preservada. No entanto, ela sofreu uma série de perdas em um curto período de tempo: saída dos filhos de casa, diminuição do poder aquisitivo e afastamento de atividades de lazer. A distinção dos sintomas de um DCL e um transtorno depressivo pode ser extremamente complexa. Por vezes, os sintomas se sobrepõem, podendo o DCL ser um fator desencadeante para o transtorno depressivo ou mutuamente. Na ocasião da avaliação, as falhas na memória da examinanda foram melhor explicadas pela depressão. A depressão pode afetar tanto a memória de curto como a de longo prazo, interferindo no processo de aquisição e resgate do que foi memorizado, bem como acarretar falhas atencionais uma vez que, quando o estímulo não é recebido, não pode ser recordado.",

      "title": "Nystagmus: Diagnosis, Topographic Anatomical Localization and Therapy",
      "abstract": "Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, most often involuntary eye movements. It normally consists of a slow (pathological) drift of the eyes, followed by a fast central compensatory movement back to the primary position (refixation saccade). The direction, however, is reported according to the fast phase. The cardinal symptoms are, on the one hand, blurred vision, jumping images (oscillopsia), reduced visual acuity and, sometimes, double vision; many of these symptoms depend on the eye position. On the other hand, depending on the etiology, patients may suffer from the following symptoms: 1. permanent dizziness, postural imbalance, and gait disorder (typical of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus); 2. if the onset of symptoms is acute, the patient may experience spinning vertigo with a tendency to fall to one side (due to ischemia in the area of the brainstem or cerebellum with central fixation nystagmus or as acute unilateral vestibulopathy with spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus); or 3. positional vertigo. There are two major categories: the first is spontaneous nystagmus, i.e., nystagmus which occurs in the primary position as upbeat or downbeat nystagmus; and the second includes various types of nystagmus which are induced or modified by certain factors. Examples are gaze-evoked nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. In addition, there are disorders similar to nystagmus, such as ocular flutter or opsoclonus. The most common central types of spontaneous nystagmus are downbeat and upbeat, infantile, pure torsional, pendular fixation, periodic alternating, and seesaw nystagmus. Many types of nystagmus allow a precise neuroanatomical localization: for instance, downbeat nystagmus, which is most often caused by a bilateral floccular lesion or dysfunction, or upbeat nystagmus, which is caused by a lesion in the midbrain or medulla. Examples of drug treatment are the use of 4-aminopyridine for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, memantine or gabapentin for pendular fixation nystagmus, or baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus. In this article we are focusing on nystagmus. In a second article we will focus on central ocular motor disorders, such as saccade or gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and gaze-holding deficits. Therefore, these types of eye movements will not be described here in detail.Unter einem Nystagmus versteht man rhythmische Augenbewegungen, die i. d. R. aus einer langsamen (ursächlichen bzw. pathologischen) Augendrift und einer schnellen kompensatorischen Rückstellbewegung (Rückstellsakkade) bestehen; die Richtung wird klinisch nach der schnellen Phase angegeben. Leitsymptome sind zum einen Verschwommensehen, „hüpfende oder laufende Bilder“ (Oszillopsien), verminderte Sehschärfe sowie manchmal Doppelbilder, die oft blickpositionsabhängig sind. Zum anderen können die Patienten, je nach Ursache, leiden unter 1. permanentem Schwankschwindel und Gangunsicherheit (wie beim Downbeat- [DBN] oder Upbeat-Nystagmus [UBN]), 2. Drehschwindel mit gerichteter Fallneigung (bei akutem Beginn) sowie 3. Lagerungsschwindel. Es lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Kategorien unterscheiden: 1. Spontannystagmus, d. h. ein Nystagmus, der in Geradeausblickposition auftritt, wie DBN oder UBN, und 2. verschiedene Nystagmusformen, die durch bestimmte Faktoren ausgelöst oder moduliert werden, wie Blickrichtungs-, Kopfschüttel-, Rebound-, Lagerungs-, hyperventilations- oder druckinduzierter Nystagmus. Daneben gibt es noch nystagmusähnliche schnelle Augenbewegungen wie Ocular Flutter oder Opsoklonus. Die häufigsten zentralen Formen eines Spontannystagmus sind DBN, UBN, infantiler Nystagmus, seltener sind Fixationspendelnystagmus, rein torsioneller, periodisch alternierender und See-saw-Nystagmus. Viele Nystagmusformen erlauben eine genaue anatomische Lokalisation, wie z. B. der DBN, der meistens auf einer beidseitigen zerebellären Flocculusläsion beruht oder der UBN auf einer Läsion im Mesenzephalon oder der Medulla oblongata. Beispiele einer Pharmakotherapie sind die Gabe von 4-Aminopyridin beim DBN und UBN, Memantin oder Gabapentin beim Fixationspendelnystagmus oder Baclofen beim periodisch alternierenden Nystagmus. Abschließend: in einem nachfolgenden Artikel werden in dieser Zeitschrift die häufigsten und klinisch relevanten zentralen Okulomotorikstörungen wie Sakkaden und Blickparesen, internukleäre Ophthalmoplegie oder Blickhaltedefekte dargestellt, sodass auf diese hier nicht detailliert eingegangen wird.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "As with all aspects of the neurological examination, important clues come from a thorough and appropriate history. In relation to eye movement disorders the patients may be complaining of double vision, in which case they should be asked whether it is constant or intermittent; does it occur, or is it maximal, in certain directions of gaze; what is the relationship of one image with the other; and have they tried covering one eye and did that relieve the symptom? A less frequently reported symptom is oscillopsia, an illusion of movement of stationary objects, when enquiries need to be made whether the movement is horizontal or vertical, and does it become maximally apparent in certain positions of gaze, as for example in downbeat nystagmus when the oscillopsia is maximal on down gaze. Nystagmus will not be described here and has been covered in a previous article in Practical Neurology .1\n\nThe first part of any examination is observation and again this may provide clues to the diagnosis. Look out for abnormal head postures, turns or tilts, the latter typically occurring in an isolated trochlear nerve palsy; abnormal patterns of eye–head coordination, such as the head thrusts seen in ocular motor apraxia; abnormalities of the eyelids such as ptosis in an oculomotor palsy and myasthenia gravis, or retraction as is seen in thyroid ophthalmopathy and progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nWe are now ready to examine the eye movements, hopefully with the benefit of some clues to the diagnosis already obtained from the history and simple observation of the patient.\n\n### Ocular misalignment\n\nFirst ask the patient to look at a distant object and observe any obvious ocular misalignment or abnormal, spontaneous eye movements. If one eye is deviated inward relative to the other this is referred to as an esotropia , whereas if there is …",

      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "title": "An Elderly Man With Chaotic Sleep Behaviors and Rapidly Progressive Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are increasingly recognized as common features of autoimmune encephalitis (AE), manifesting in various presentations, including insomnia, hypersomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias, and sleep breathing disorders. These features may be overlooked because of the difficulty of detecting them and a lack of awareness of their significance. Here, we provide an interesting case, with video-polysomnography (v-PSG) documentation, of an unusual sleep manifestation associated with rapidly progressive ataxia of an elderly man with AE. An 87-year-old man, who was a retired soldier with previously able activity of daily living is activity of daily living, presented with progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep over the last 3 months. His wife observed that he occasionally had abnormal motor behaviors during sleep, resembling fighting in the air during the night. In the last 2 months, he also had visual hallucinations and his cognition had declined. One week before admission, he developed an unsteady gait with repeated falls and the abnormal motor behaviors during sleep occurred more frequently. His past medical history included well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications were linagliptin (5 mg/day) and repaglinide (150 mg/day). He had no history of illicit drug or alcohol use. On admission, general examinations were unremarkable. However, although he was alert and co-operative, he intermittently lapsed into sleep, but was easily roused. During those sleep episodes, he developed abnormal behaviors resembling daytime work tasks and vocalizations (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from the onset of sleep (Video 1). These abnormal sleep episodes occurred most of the day and night time. Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test (Video 2). Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 14/30 with the prominent impairment of attention and recall memory. Other examinations were normal. After a few days after admission, his symptoms rapidly progressed. His consciousness declined to stupor with frequent inspiratory stridor, requiring intubation and ventilator support. We did not observe any episode of faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) during admission. This video was performed on the second night of admission. He developed abnormal behaviors resembling doing daytime work tasks and vocalization (mumbling sound), which immediately presented from sleep onset. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Eye movement examination revealed broken pursuit and hypermetric saccades, whereas other cerebellar signs were impaired, consisting of truncal ataxia, wide-based gait, impaired tandem gait, and impaired bilateral finger-to-nose test. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13537 Blood chemistry revealed marked hypokalemia (2.2 mmol/L) without hyponatraemia (Na 138 mmol/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiles revealed white blood cell (WBC) 3 cell/mm3, no red blood cell (RBC), protein 27 mg/dL, glucose 75 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan showed no abnormal hypersignal intensity or contrast enhancement, whereas electroencephalography demonstrated diffuse background slowing without epileptiform discharge. Interestingly, the 24 hours wearable v-PSG test exhibited at almost every time period a mixture of α rhythm, REM, and slow-wave sleep, which was compatible with status dissociatus (SD) (Fig. 1). The serum autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibodies were positive for leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody, whereas the rest (NMDAR, CASPR2, GABAb, DPPX6, AMPA, Ma2, IgLON5) were all negative, but anti-LGI1 and other antibodies were negative in CSF studies. Comprehensive radiological investigations, consisting of computed tomography (CT) chest and whole abdomen did not identify any underlying malignancy. A complete course of intravenous immunoglobulin and pulse methylprednisolone was given, followed by oral prednisolone, which gradually improved cognition and reduced abnormal sleep episodes. He could walk without support 3 months later and abnormal sleep episodes were gone. The presentations of our patient, consisting of rapidly progressive cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and subacute sleep–wake disorders including progressive hypersomnolence and abnormal behaviors during sleep, raised the possibility of an autoimmune process, prion disease, or an atypical presentation of a neurodegenerative disease, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of SD was a unique characteristic in this case. SD is an extreme form of parasomnia with overlapping features of non-REM, REM sleep, and wakefulness and is presented in fatal familial insomnia1 or severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.2 In addition, the combination of sleep disturbances, inspiratory stridor, and gait instability could lead to the possibility of encephalopathy associated with IgLON5 antibodies.3 However, our case had other atypical presentations, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, lack of FBDS, and lack of hyponatraemia. The typical presentation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis, which is frequently manifested in elderly men,4-6 is characterized by a triad of memory changes, seizures, and abnormal movements. FBDS has been reported in 26% to 71% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis.4 Finally, although sleep disorders in AE are less recognized in clinical practice, these features have been reported in 20% to 65% of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis, encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, RBD, periodic limb movements in sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea.7-9 In addition, we reviewed relevant literature on sleep disorders and AE, as shown in Table 1. Considering cerebellar ataxia in anti-LGI1 encephalitis, only two case reports were identified of a child and a young adult with LGI1 antibody-associated AE presented with progressive and episodic ataxia.10, 11 In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the importance of sleep disorders in AE. Sleep disorders can be the first clinical presentation in AE, a treatable disorder, and v-PSG can assist in differentiating sleep disturbances to aid diagnosis. Early awareness and prompt effective management of uncommon sleep manifestations are vital and potentially associated with improved treatment outcomes (Video 3).

      "abstract": "The stress reaction (acute, repetitive or chronic stress patterns) is a non-specific response of an organism to a pathological state. The metabolic characteristics of these stress patterns are well documented. Recognizing the interrelation between a stress-induced pathological state and the relevant pattern of the resultant stress reaction can provide a more accurate assessment of actual cellular metabolism than an approach relying on blood glucose values. Stress activation is obligatorily associated with negative energetic balance in affected cellular metabolism, which is reversed by elimination of the stressor. Prolongation of the stress reaction is a marker indicating the ineffective elimination of the causal stressor. Chronic stress induces progressive self-generating cellular metabolic dysfunction, resulting in the development of both diabetic and ischaemic disorders. Chronic stress conditions are characterized by reductions in inducible metabolic capacity, acute stress tolerance, and functional performance, accompanied by stress-specific micro- and macroscopic alterations. Chronic stress can be activated by both somatic and psychomental stressors. Diabetes, starvation, obesity, ageing, pregnancy, and any chronic disease state of a vital organ are associated with activation of stress reaction. The increased susceptibility of diabetic patients on gliflozins to the development of postoperative euglycaemic ketoacidosis can be explained by a reduction in chronic stress-associated acute stress tolerance, related mainly to diabetes, and a relative glucose deficiency induced by gliflozin therapy. Chronic hyperglycaemia associated with chronic stress should be considered both the primary cause and the secondary consequence of cellular dysmetabolism. Achievement of near-normoglycaemia is a beneficial effect but is not a causal intervention",

Deprescribing is recommended when there is loss of efficacy, major side effects, or use longer than four weeks. The withdrawal syndrome is due to physiologic dependence based on various receptor adaptations. Psychological, neurophysiologic, and somatic complaints can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric, psychosomatic, or substance use disorder. These symptoms may be severe and prolonged. The discontinuation process should include careful planning, support, and the use of cognitive behavioral therapy. Tapering, perhaps after substituting with a long-acting BzRA, should be patient-led and proceed slowly, anticipating completion over 12 to 18 months or even longer. In a proportion of patients, symptoms may continue months or years after complete BzRA cessation, requiring ongoing medical care.",

The overriding complex neurological control is also important. A disorder of any of these may lead to faecal incontinence. This can affect over 10% of adults and at least 1–2% of patents will report these as major symptoms. In itself, faecal incontinence is not a disease but a symptom and it is necessary to take a full history and examine a patient to identify any underlying diseases or pathology that may need treatment before focusing on managing incontinence. The aim of any treatment for faecal incontinence is to improve the patient’s quality of life and give them some control back over their bowel function. Constipation is an increasing problem in the Western world and it is widely accepted that approximately 50% of adults are constipated at any point in time. Constipation encompasses a multitude of symptoms; the general mental health and social functioning of people with constipation is impaired when compared to health controls. The symptoms of constipation occur in a large percentage of the general population. The impact on quality of life when they occur for a long period of time is large. However, patients often have many coexisting other pelvic floor disorders. Although there are surgical options available, it is important to treat conservatively and understand the complexity of the other issues involved in patients presenting with constipation.",

Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

      "title": "Sleep and prolonged epileptic activity (status epilepticus).",
      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

      "abstract": "Swallowing is a dynamic process that requires more than 30 muscles in the recruitment/coordination of the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. The eating and swallowing procedure is learned in sensitive or critical periods: when a certain degree of maturation has been achieved, the appropriate stimulus permits a certain milestone of development to occur. The swallowing procedure occurs in three main stages oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Therefore, swallowing disorders may present in any, some, or all of these stages in addition to feeding problems. Adult dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, has long been reported in the literature. Infants and children also experience feeding disorders and swallowing problems, either because of developmental disorders, syndromes, behavioral or neurological conditions, respiratory problems, and/or gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis or anatomical deficits. Feeding problems or dysphagia are seen in up to 25% of all children; approximately 40% of prematurely born infants have swallowing disorders, up to 64-78% with developmental disorders and up to 99% with cerebral palsy. Diagnostic options include health status, broad social environment, parent-child interactions, and parental concerns. Evaluation of dysphagia and feeding disorders involves a multifactorial approach. Imaging studies may include videofluoroscopy and/or fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Successful oral feeding must be measured in quality of meal time experiences with best possible oral sensorimotor skills and safe swallowing while not jeopardizing a child's functional health status or the parent-child relationship. An interdisciplinary team approach enables coordinated global assessment and therapy planning.",

      "abstract": "Early myoclonic epilepsy (EME) and Ohtahara syndrome (OS) or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) are the earliest epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. These two entities share many features, including age at presentation, a similar electroencephalographic pattern, intractable seizures, and poor prognosis. EME and EIEE are traditionally distinguished according to different type of seizures, differences in the pattern of suppression-burst, and aetiologies. In EIEE onset is within the first 3 months of age and often within the first 2 weeks. Infants acutely develop tonic spasms that can be either generalized or lateralized, can occur both isolated or in clusters, and are independent from the sleep cycle. The most specific EEG feature is the suppression-burst (SB). This pattern is characterized by high-voltage bursts alternating with almost flat suppression phases at an approximately regular rate. SB pattern differs definitely from the periodic type of hypsarrhythmia where it becomes remarkable in sleep. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) can be associated with structural, metabolic, and genetic abnormalities: methylmalonic acidemia, sulphite oxidase deficiency, Menkes disease, and Zellweger syndrome, and CDG disorders. Other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies due to specific genetic aetiology include CDKL5-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 300672), KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 613720), SCN2A-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 613721), and SCN8A-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 614558).",

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

      "abstract": "The physical and mental benefits of physical activity are unquestionable. However, while much research has been done into the benefits of exercise in the prevention and treatment of numerous physical illnesses, the study of the impact of exercise on psychopathological conditions is more recent. Moreover, for several reasons, there are some grey areas and some controversy regarding physical exercise in patients with feeding and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia. This controversy may stem from several issues. On the one hand, because there is a fine line between healthy physical exercise and over-exercising (which may become exercise dependence); on the other hand, because of the strong association that some mental disorders (such as anorexia) have with disruptive exercise use, with several clinicians and researchers implying that exercise may eventually cause a feeding and eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "Patients with anorexia nervosa may minimize their symptoms with the result that doctors often fail to appreciate the distress they experience. The drastic avoidance of food is passed off euphemistically as ‘dieting’, and in later stages of the illness the patient's suffering is increased by depression, loss of concentration and insomnia. Much misery is also endured by other members of the family who observe with dread the young girl's progressive wasting and appear overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness. The illness usually runs a prolonged course even when the outcome is eventually favourable. An uncertain but sizeable proportion of patients enter a chronic phase with persistent preoccupations about food, uncontrollable overeating, self-induced vomiting, and even more severe depression (bulimia nervosa). Anorexia nervosa is therefore an illness which exacts a high toll in terms of human suffering. For this reason and in view of an increased incidence of the illness (Kendell et al, 1973; Crisp et al, 1976), it is desirable to improve methods of treatment and apply those currently available with the utmost skill.",

Anatomically and physiologically the ARAS has a redundancy of pathways and neurotransmitters; this may explain why coma is usually transient (seldom lasting more than 3 weeks). Emergence from coma is succeeded by outcomes ranging from the vegetative state to complete recovery, depending on the severity of damage to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and their integrated function. The clinical and laboratory assessments of the comatose patient are reviewed here, along with an analysis of how various conditions (structural brain lesions, metabolic and toxic disorders, trauma, infections, seizures, hypothermia, and hyperthermia) produce coma. Management issues include the determination of the cause and reversibility (prognosis) of neurological impairment, support of the patient, definitive treatment when possible, and the ethical considerations for those situations where marked disability is predicted with certainty.",

      "title": "Non-24-Hour Sleep–Wake Rhythm Disorder in the Totally Blind: Diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Many aspects of human physiology and behaviour are dominated by 24-hour circadian rhythms that have a major impact on our health and well-being. These include the sleep-wake cycle, alertness and performance patterns, and many daily hormone profiles. The rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\", the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the anterior hypothalamus. This master clock has, for most humans, an intrinsic rhythm slightly longer than 24 hours. Daily retinal light exposure is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized with the external 24-hour solar environment. This daily synchronization process generally poses no problems for sighted individuals although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. However, many blind people with no perception of light experience periodical circadian desynchrony. This is due to the absence of light information to the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in poor synchronisationsynchronization of circadian rhythms. Affected patients experience cyclical or periodic episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction, severely interfering with social, academic and professional life. The diagnosis of Non-24 Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder Syndrome, also named free-running disorder, non-entrained disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome remains challenging from a clinical point of view due to the cyclical symptoms and should be confirmed by measurements of circadian biomarkers such as urinary melatonin to demonstrate a circadian period outside the normal range. Management includes behavioural modification and melatonin. Tasimelteon, a novel melatonin receptor 1 and 2 agonist, has demonstrated its effectiveness and safety with an evening dose of 20 mg in and is currently the only treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA.",

      "title": "Weight phobia or overvaluation of shape and weight? A cognitive analysis of the core psychopathology of anorexia nervosa",
      "abstract": "The avoidance paradigm has dominated the psychological conceptualization of anorexia nervosa, for many years. According to that theory, “weight phobia” explains most of the behavioural expressions of the disorder, which are adopted to avoid aversive stimuli (i.e., weight gain and getting fat). However, the conceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a simple phobic disorder is difficult to uphold, as it does not explain the sense of triumph, mastery, self-control and superiority that people suffering from this disorder experience when they are able to control their eating and lose weight. Transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural theory, on the other hand, explains the egosyntonic nature of anorexia nervosa, attributing overvaluation of shape, weight and their control as the core psychopathology of the disorder, and considering weight phobia as a secondary expression of this core psychopathology. The evidence-based “enhanced” cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-E), derived from this transdiagnostic theory, is not designed to primarily address weight phobia, but rather to help patients develop a more articulated and functional scheme of self-evaluation that is less dependent on shape, weight and their control, by involving the patients actively in the implementation of strategies and procedures that make feel them in control during the process of change.",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

Over the past several decades, a number of definitions of drug addiction have been used. Although some of the historically earliest definitions of addiction or drug dependence relied in part on the consequences of protracted drug exposure as defining characteristics, contemporary definitions generally recognize that use of a psychoactive drug itself is the central element in the process of addiction (see review in ). For example, the recent report of the US Surgeon General on Nicotine Addiction used three primary criteria in defining addiction (): 1. Drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior is driven by strong, often irresistable urges and can persist despite a desire to quit or even repeated attempts to quit; 2. The drug has psychoactive or mood-altering effects in the brain; and 3. The drug is capable of functioning as a reinforcing agent that directly strengthens behavior leading to further drug-taking.",

      "title": "[Transient amnesia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "The two main aetiologies of transient amnesia in the elderly are idiopathic transient global amnesia (TGA) and iatrogenic or toxic amnesia. Vascular and epileptic amnesia are less common. According to the literature, transient psychogenic amnesia, which is a frequent cause of amnesia at age 30 to 50, is very rare in the elderly. TGA is the prototypical picture of transient amnesia. It occurs more often after age 50, with no identified cause, even if some authors accept emotional stress or minor head trauma as occasional precipitants. The mechanism of TGA remains a matter of discussion. It may be the consequence of a spreading depression similar to that described in migraine with aura, but other arguments support an ischemic mechanism. Iatrogenic amnesias are mainly caused by benzodiazepines (BZs) or anticholinergics. The former may occur in a non-anxious subject, who is not a usual consumer of BZ and takes a single dose. The latter are more often due to a hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, in particular in patients presenting with a covert, incipient Alzheimer's disease. A vascular origin must be considered when amnesia is accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and when the regression of the amnesic disorder is slow, lasting several days. It results from lesions involving various mechanisms and locations, mainly subcortical. Partial seizures, most often mesio-temporal, more rarely frontal, may be the cause of transient amnesia in the elderly, in the absence of a past history of epilepsy. The red flag supportive of an epileptic origin is the repetition of stereotyped amnesic episodes. EEG demonstration of seizures may be difficult and the response to antiepileptic drugs effective on partial seizures is usually good.",

      "abstract": "Funktionelle Erkrankungen des Magendarmtrakts sind uberaus haufig. Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment is a condition in which a person experiences a slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities compared with others of the same age. The minor decline in abilities is noticeable by the person experiencing them or by others who interact with the person, but the changes are not severe enough to interfere with normal daily life and activities. Some gradual mental decline is seen with normal aging. For example, the ability to learn new information may be reduced, mental processing slows, speed of performance slows, and ability to become distracted increases. However, these declines due to normal aging do not affect overall functioning or ability to perform activities of daily living.",

      "title": "TANGO2-Related Metabolic Encephalopathy and Arrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias can present in acute metabolic crisis (hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, mild hyperammonemia) or with developmental delay, regression, and/or seizures. The acute presentation varies from profound muscle weakness, ataxia, and/or disorientation to a comatose state. Individuals can present with intermittent acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The first episode of myoglobinuria has been known to occur as early as age five months. Acute renal tubular damage due to myoglobinuria can result in acute kidney injury and renal failure. During acute illness, transient electrocardiogram changes can be seen; the most common is QT prolongation. Life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes occurs primarily during times of acute illness. Individuals who do not present in metabolic crises may present with gait incoordination, progressively unsteady gait, difficulty with speech, or clumsiness. Intellectual disability of variable severity is observed in almost all individuals. Seizures are observed outside the periods of crises in more than 75% of individuals. Hypothyroidism has been reported in more than one third of individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TANGO2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoidance of triggers for acute metabolic crisis (e.g., prolonged fasting, dehydration, ketogenic diet). Infusion of intravenous glucose during significant acute periods of systemic metabolic stress caused by infection or general anesthesia may be required to prevent significant catabolism. Prevention of secondary complications: Provide hydration and alkalinization of the urine during an attack of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria to prevent renal failure. An emergency plan should be in place to initiate steps to suppress acute catabolism and promote hydration in order to minimize the risk of life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. Prior to determining the rate and amount of fluid administration, an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function should be considered. Surveillance: Regular cardiology evaluation for management of cardiac arrhythmias; annual TSH and free T4; neurology follow up to manage epilepsy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting; dehydration; ketogenic diet, which can precipitate severe metabolic crises. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing to allow prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the TANGO2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

One month old infants are normally awake during one-third of the nocturnal sleeping time. Gradually, sleep moves into night and wakefulness into daytime. At 3 years, 25 to 38% of children wake up during the night, but after 5 years this proportion becomes negligible. Apart from acute or chronic diseases which may produce sleep disorders, most of these are due to environmental factors. Two syndrome are worthy of special mention: deficiency of slow wave and deep sleep in psychosocial dwarfism, and insomnia due to intolerance to cow's milk. Treatment of insomniac children rests on behavioural techniques: parents must be helped to understand and observe the sleep-wake rhythm of their children and teach them to acquire regular sleeping habits.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

Identification and proper management of these patients requires the healthcare provider to maintain a high index of suspicion for these illnesses and to readily recognize signs and symptoms consistent with ED pathology. Common presenting complaints include headache, mood changes, sore throat, dizziness/syncope, palpitations, fatigue/generalized weakness, sports-related or overuse injuries, and gastrointestinal (GI) complaints such as indigestion, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and hematemesis.

      "title": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The problem of selective degeneration of single organs or parts of organs is increasingly occupying the attention of physicians. To an ever greater extent these lesions are being traced to the activity of chemical substances or to deficiencies of specific chemical substances (vitamins). Wherever they occur, whether in the liver, the bone marrow, the adrenal gland or the nervous system, they show certain features in common.

It is supposed that the disease could be the consequence of a combination of cultural-social, psychological and biological factors. Our study confirmed that anorexia mentalis is a serious, life threatening disorder which in our country appears earlier than it was expected and that is strongly related to environmental factors (family, school, fashion, society). We showed that specific personality traits are characteristic for both, young patients and mothers. Sublimation of emotional stress by exceptional performances, accompanied by food restrictive consumption together with hypersensitivity, oppositional behavior and aggression are specific for this disorder. High levels of self-imposed standards increase the risk for psychological distress, especially for eating disorder symptomatology. Both genders could be involved as patients. Boys must be especially followed for possible psychiatric manifestation. We confirmed that the biofeedback as additional therapeutic modality is very useful.",

These include acute stress disorder (ASD), feelings of depression and guilt, and other anxiety reactions, such as panic attacks. The essential features of ASD are similar to those of PTSD. ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obesity are frequently comorbid. The prevalence of ADHD rises from around 2.8% in the general population (adults) to about 27% among those with obesity. Although neurobiological mechanisms explaining the strong association between ADHD and obesity are still unclear, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high comorbidity, including common genes, dopaminergic neurotransmission, deficits in executive functions (planning, adherence to weight loss programs or protocols after bariatric surgery) and circadian rhythm dysregulation. Objectives Review on the relationship between ADHD and Obesity, focusing on possible biological mechanisms driving their high comorbidity. Methods We conducted a search in PubMed and ClinicalKey with the terms: “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder”, “Obesity”, “Dopamine”. Results Altered reward processing and impaired inhibitory control are key features of ADHD and are also related to obesity. The ability to resist the impulse to eat and an appropriate reward response require normal function of these dopamine circuits. Both ADHD and obesity are usually associated with reduced volume of putamen, known to be a fundamental player in inhibitory control functioning. Human and animal studies have also demonstrated that obese individuals have decreased dopamine D2 receptor availability in the striatum. Recently genetic analyses implicated specifically Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP Signaling in both ADHD and Obesity. Conclusions ADHD and obesity are often comorbid. Dysregulated dopaminergic neurotransmission seems to be a fundamental factor underlying the overlap between ADHD and obesity, probably involving DARPP-32 signaling and possibly through neurobiological features of putamen, namely inhibitory control. Further studies are necessary to explain the neurobiological correlation between these entities.",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

      "abstract": "Physiological Background of Muscular Pain During Skiing and Delayed Muscle Soreness after Skiing During intensive skiing, at each turn, in particular towards the end of the turning steering phase, eccentric work of the lower limb muscles occurs (predominantly of the quadriceps femoris), which is the direct cause of damage within muscle cells. A few or more than ten hours after intensive physical effort the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness may appear, which is mainly a result of the micro-damage within the myocytes. The following procedure can be proposed for prevention of muscle soreness for skiers: around a week before first day of skiing in the season, skiers should perform a series of intensive physical exercises involving eccentric contractions, thus inducing delayed muscular soreness. The exercises may involve for example: downhill running, preferably down a steep slope, running down stairs, deep knee bend jumps, deep knee bend jumps over an obstacle, jumping to the ground from a certain height, sit-ups on one or both feet, etc. The exercises should lead considerable local fatigue, in particular of the lower limb muscles, so that muscle soreness occurs on the second day, in particular in the frontal part of the thighs. After approximately two days the pain will alleviate, while after a week the strength of the muscles will return to its pre-exercise condition. This should considerably reduce, or even remove, delayed muscle soreness after skiing, which will not only help skiers use their time more effectively but will also be crucial to the skiers' safety.",

CBT in the form of exposure response therapy (ERP) and/or SSRI/clomipramine administration is the mainstay of treatment. We present a unique OCD case in the nature of obsessions and compulsions, cachexia presentation without anorexia, and history of multiple inpatient psychiatric admissions. Our patient's obsessions focus on eating at specific times, prompting compulsive eating patterns that often result in starvation due to missing timeframes that the patient deems acceptable for eating. His resulting cachexia and eventual worsening of depression to the point of suicidality necessitated multiple inpatient stays and placement at a long-term mental health care facility.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. One of the areas impacted in ADHD is executive functioning with significant difficulties in response control, self-monitoring, planning, and general regulation. These difficulties seem to be intertwined with identifying and managing emotions. In this chapter, a theory of emotion regulation in ADHD is proposed considering a lifespan approach. In ADHD, emotional regulation is impacted at every level—poor response control and emotional modulation along with poor monitoring of impact of emotional response on others. It is often seen that children with ADHD set themselves in cycles of emotion dysregulation leading to negative feedback leading to further emotion dysregulation. Taking a lifespan approach, this cycle consistently creates social environments where regulation is not taught, thereby giving a strong message of failure to the individual. Finally, these manifest as anxiety responses or depression in adults where the adult is easily overwhelmed due to constant inability to regulate themselves. Thus, although emotion dysregulation may be obvious in children, it becomes layered and complex in adults with ADHD. Understanding ADHD from such a lifespan approach is critical towards arriving at correct diagnosis at different developmental stages and towards treatment planning.",

Sleep could be described at the behavioral level (relative lack of movements and awareness and responsiveness) and at the brain level (based on EEG activity). Sleep could be characterized by its duration, by its distribution during the 24-hr day period, and by its quality (e.g., consolidated versus fragmented). Different methods have been developed to assess various aspects of sleep. This chapter covers the most established and common methods used to assess sleep in infants and children. These methods include polysomnography, videosomnography, actigraphy, direct observations, sleep diaries, and questionnaires. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are highlighted.",

They also involve memory traces that link both positive and negative reinforcing effects of drugs to affective states and environmental stimuli. Long after the obvious signs of withdrawal have abated, these affective states and stimuli may evoke urges to use the drug again (craving), some component of withdrawal distress, or both. In those who were formerly drug dependent, ingestion of a drug that produces a positive reinforcement may have a ‘priming’ effect resulting in increased craving for the drug of dependence. In addition to traditional pharmacological approaches, which seek to reduce relapse by ameliorating changes associated with withdrawal, or to block the reinforcing actions of drugs, newer approaches to relapse-prevention teach former users how to avoid situations that evoke craving or to cope with it when it cannot be avoided. In clinical practice, the distinction between positive and negative reinforcement is not always clear. Evidence that drug use alters the biology of the organism does not necessarily assume that society will attribute continued drug-taking to a ‘disease’ rather than to wilful misconduct.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Currently utilized clinician-rated symptom scales for tardive dyskinesia (TD) have not kept up with the expanding spectrum of TD phenomenology. The objective of this study was to develop and test the reliability of a new instrument, the CTI. Methods A movement disorder neurologist devised the outline of the scale. A steering committee (four neurologists and two psychiatrists) provided revisions until consensus was reached. The resulting instrument assesses frequency of abnormal movements of the eye/eyelid/face, tongue/mouth, jaw, limb/trunk, complex movements (e.g., handwringing, self-caressing), and vocalizations. The CTI rates symptoms from 0–3 with 0 = absent, 1 = infrequent/intermittent or only present with activating maneuvers, 2 = frequent intermittent, brief periods without movements, 3 = constant or nearly constant. Functional impairments including activities of daily living (ADL), social impairment, symptom bother, and harm are rated 0–3 with 0 = patient is unaware or unaffected, 1 = symptoms mildly impact patient, 2 = symptoms moderately impact patient, 3 = symptoms severely impact patient. Following institutional review board approval, the CTI underwent inter-rater and test-retest reliability testing. Videos of patient TD examinations were obtained and reviewed by two movement disorder specialists to confirm the diagnosis of TD by consensus and the adequacy to demonstrate a TD-consistent movement. Vignettes were created to include patients’ symptom descriptions and functional, social, or occupational impairments/limitations. Four clinicians rated each video/vignette. Selected videos/vignettes were also subject to an intra-rater retest. Interrater agreement was analyzed via 2-way random-effects interclass correlation (ICC) and test-retest agreement assessment utilizing Kendall’s tau-b. Results 45 video/vignettes were assessed for interrater reliability, and 16 for test-retest reliability. ICCs for movement frequency were as follows: abnormal eye movement .89; abnormal tongue/mouth movement .91; abnormal jaw movement .89; abnormal limb movement .76; complex movement .87; abnormal vocalization .77; and functional impairments including harm .82; social embarrassment .88; ADLs .83; and symptom bother .92. Retests were conducted on mean (SD) 15 (3) days later with scores ranging from .66–.87. Conclusions The CTI is a new instrument with good reliability in assessing TD symptoms and functional impacts. Future validation study is warranted. Funding Neurocrine Biosciences",

There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

      "abstract": "Molly, age 9, is diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by her psychiatrist, who prescribes a longacting methylphenidate formulation at 1 mg/kg. She tolerates the medication without side effects and shows significant improvement in her academic performance and on-task behavior in school. Molly takes methylphenidate before school at 7:00 am; this dose usually wears off at approximately 3:30 pm. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Molly and her parents are pleased with her response to methylphenidate, but report that she has difficulty getting ready for school because of distractibility. In the evenings Molly has trouble staying seated to do homework and often interrupts and argues with family members, but cannot tolerate afternoon dosing of immediate-release methylphenidate because of insomnia. ADHD, the most common childhood neuxobehavioral disorder, is characterized by difficulties with attention, impulse control, and modulating activity level. The pathophysiology of ADHD is thought to involve dys-regulation of brain dopamine and norepinephrine systems.1 Managing ADHD includes pharmacotherapeutic and nonpharmacotherapeutic--ie, behavioral and psychoeducational--interventions. (2), (3) In this article, we provide an overview of the efficacy, side effects, and dosing for the 3 classes of ADHD medication--psychostimulants, atom-oxetine, and [[alpha].sub.2] adrenergic agonists--including guidance on medication choice and combination treatment. We also discuss the effects of psychostimulants on tics, cardiovascular concerns, and substance abuse potential. Psychostimulants Mcthylphenidates and amphetamines are first-line agents for ADHD. Their primary mechanism of action involves blocking dopamine transporters, with additional effects including blockade of norepinephrine transporters, dampening action of monoamine oxidase (which slows dopamine and norepinephrine degradation), and enhanced release of dopamine into the synaptic space. (1) Efficacy and response rates are similar for methylphenidate and amphetamine medications, although as many as 25% of patients may respond to only 1 agent. (1) More than 90% of patients will have a positive response to one of the psychostimulants. (1) The beneficial effects of psychostimulants on inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are well documented. (2) Improvements in noncompliance, aggression, social interactions, and academic productivity also have been observed. (4), (5) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Because of increased recognition of pervasive ADHD-related impairments, which can affect functioning in social, family, and extracurricular settings, practitioners have shifted to long-acting psychostimulants to reduce the need for in-school dosing, improve compliance, and obtain more after-school treatment effects. Long-acting formulations produce a slower rise and fall of psychostimulant levels in the brain, which may decrease side effects and potential for later drug abuse.

      "title": "Implication d'autoanticorps dirigés contre les neuropeptides dans le comportement alimentaire normal et pathologique",
      "abstract": "Les troubles du comportement alimentaire (TCA) sont caracterises par une alteration de l'appetit et des emotions. Es sont representes par deux formes principales : l'anorexie (AN) et la boulimie nerveuse (BN). Ces troubles peuvent aussi etre classes en sous-types, comme l'hyperphagie compulsive ou d'autres formes, appelees troubles du comportement alimentaire non specifiques (eating disorder not otherwise specified, EDNOS). La perte d'appetit peut egalement etre observee en dehors des contextes de TCA. Elle est souvent referencee comme une anorexie induite par une pathologie ou son traitement (Le. Chimiotherapie). Une alteration chronique de l'appetit entraine des anomalies metaboliques et ponderales. A terme, elle peut deriver en une malnutrition et une cachexie ou en obesite. Les TCA sont associes a une augmentation de la mortalite et des risques de co-morbidite : depression, troubles du sommeil, desordres intestinaux. L'etiologie des TCA et les anorexies associees a la chimiotherapie sont encore meconnues. L'a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) est un peptide jouant un role cle dans la signalisation de la satiete. Nous avons recemment identifie des autoanticorps (autoAc) diriges contre des neuropeptides impliques dans la prise alimentaire, en particulier contre l'a-MSH chez l'Homme. L'etat psychiatrique de patients souffrants de TCA est correle avec le taux plasmatique d'autoAc anti-a-MSH. L'ensemble de ces donnees suggere l'implication des autoAc anti-a-MSH dans les mecanismes neurobiologiques des TCA. Le but de cette these est donc d'analyser : - les mecanismes biologiques declenchant l'anorexie associee a la chimiotherapie La correlation de la modulation de la production et/ou de l'affmite des autoAc anti-a-MSH avec la prise alimentaire et la masse corporelle dans l'anorexie induite par la chimiotherapie - L'impact d'autoAc diriges contre d'autres neuropeptides impliques dans la balance homeostatique et leur association avec la prise alimentaire ou la masse corporelle Nos resultats ont donne lieu a la publication de 5 articles et deux autres soumis. Nous avons determine que l'anorexie induite par le traitement au methotrexate (MTX) etait due a un signal de deshydratation percu par le cerveau a la suite de l'inflammation intestinale et de la diarrhee induite. Nous avons egalement constate une activation des neurones magnocellulaires vasopressinergiques et parvocellulaires ocytocinergiques dans l'hypothalamus. Ces resultats ne demontrent pas de l'implication directe du taux ou de l'affinite des autoAc anti-a-MSH dans l'anorexie induite par le MTX. Cependant l'inflammation intestinale est suivie d'une augmentation significative du taux d'autoAc anti-a-MSH. Ceci correle de maniere negative avec le ratio prise alimentaire/prise hydrique, suggerant un retard de la prise de poids post-inflammatoire. L'effet anorexigene des autoAc anti-a-MSH dans le modele MTX a neanmoins ete montre par la correlation positive entre le taux d'a-MSH et le retard dans la prise alimentaire et de la prise de poids apres l'injection des IgG anti-a-MSH en peripherie (IP). Chez les patients souffrants de TCA, les IgG diriges contre l'a-MSH montraient une correlation entre leurs affinites et le « Eating Disorder Inventory ». En etudiant des autoAc diriges contre d'autres peptides impliques dans la prise alimentaire, dans une cohorte de patient, nous avons identifie des relations entre l'indice de masse corporelle (IMC) et le taux ou l'affmite des autoAc plasmatiques diriges contre l'orexine A, la vasopressine, l'ocytocine, la ghreline et le neuropeptide Y. L'ensemble des resultats obtenus lors de cette these ont contribue a une meilleure comprehension des mecanismes neurobiologiques des TCA et de l'anorexie induite par le MTX. Ces etudes apportent egalement de nouvelles informations concernant l'implication des autoAc reactifs contre des neuropeptides et des hormones dans les contextes physiopathologiques de la regulation de l'appetit et du poids.",

While different clinical aspects were emphasized by different authors, it was recognized during the second half of the last century that obsessive-compulsive symptoms have cognitive, volitional and emotional facts: the patient experiences recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images as forced upon him or her, recognizes the content as unreasonable and is markedly distressed by it. Once delineated, defined and named, the obsessive-compulsive syndrome was described in a number of clinical studies with the main result of an astonishing homogeneity of content and form across culture, time and space. Symptoms fluctuate in severity and may change in content over time. In most cases, the content regards dirt and contamination, while aggression, religion, and sex also play a noticeable role. Patients spend a lot of time either yielding to, or fighting the thoughts and behaviors. As obsessive-compulsive disorder is ...",

It has a worldwide distribution and probably has been in existence since the dawn of human history. The condition is chronic but rarely fatal, and most types of epilepsy do not disturb the affected individual’s desire or ability to lead a normal life. Modern antiepileptic medications most often control seizures, and the limitations imposed by the disorder may be negligible. Unfortunately, epileptics are all too frequently stigmatized and excluded from many activities of daily life. Outdated beliefs and misconceptions about epilepsy have only recently shown signs of lessening in the United States and other industrialized societies.",

      "abstract": "Since anorexia nervosa is a multi-systemic disorder, as well as a psychiatric disorder, it needs a multidisciplinary approach. It causes many medical problems, including irregular menstruation, hematologic problems, decreased bone density, electrolyte imbalance, and dysrhythmias. Sometimes, this disorder also causes rare, unexpected complications, including abnormal air collections, such as pneumomediastinum, retropneumoperitoneum, or subcutaneous emphysema. The cause of these phenomena is unknown, although fragile parenchymal tissue that is disrupted easily when the local pressure is increased by coughing, vomiting, or defecation is a suggested cause. We experienced a case of anorexia nervosa complicated with abnormal air collections. After we excluded other possible causes, such as perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, and ordered the patient to undergo a short fast and inhale oxygen, the abnormal air collections resolved. We report this case because of its rarity and benign course. (Korean J Med 76:338-342, 2009)",

      "title": "Current status of functional gastrointestinal evaluation in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Neurogastroenterology' (2) refers to the study of gastrointestinal muscle and nerve, their regulation, as well as their integration with gastrointestinal function, the central nervous system (CNS) and neuroendocrine system. (3)The term 'motility' refers to the motor activity of the digestive tract, including the study of swallowing, gastric emptying, small bowel and colonic transit, and anorectal function.'Neurogastroenterology and motility disorders' is a broader term encompassing the organ systems that result in the symptom complex experienced by patients. (4)These include the CNS, which contributes to the sensory and motor control of the GI tract, and the enteric nervous and smooth muscles of the GI tract. (4)eurogastroenterology and motility disorders can be broadly divided into two groups -functional GI disorders (FGIDs) and GI motility disorders.In the absence of anatomical and biochemical abnormalities, patients who complain of symptoms related to the GI tract that are characterised by visceral hypersensitivity are regarded as having FGIDs.On the other hand, GI motility disorders are attributed to underlying neuromuscular pathology, and are characterised by a distinct and measurable alteration of motor function; they generally refer to diseases of GI transit and/or sphincteric function.However both groups are often regarded as 'functional', as they typically do not manifest any abnormalities on conventional endoscopy and radiological imaging, and hence, the two terminologies are frequently used interchangeably.Both FGIDs and GI motility disorders share many similar symptoms and may manifest impaired GI physiology. (1,5)Alterations in both motility and sensitivity are believed to be important in symptom generation, resulting in overlapping symptoms in both groups.FGIDs and GI motility disorders represent an emerging field in Asia, and have gradually attracted increased interest in recent years.The growth in interest is in tandem with the rapid development in research and technological advances, especially in the diagnostic armamentarium, leading to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions.This has resulted in enhanced patient care in this difficult-to-treat patient population.Both FGIDs and GI motility disorders can affect any region of the GI tract and present with symptoms attributed to a disturbance of gut transit or visceral hypersensitivity.Within the oesophagus, motility disorders include achalasia, scleroderma, hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and diffuse oesophageal spasm.Functional dysphagia, functional heartburn and functional chest pain are the commonly encountered oesophageal FGIDs.Gastroparesis is the most frequently encountered motility disorder of the stomach, while functional dyspepsia (FD) is the cardinal FGID arising from the stomach.In the colon and rectum, colonic inertia and Hirschsprung's disease are organic motility disorders, whereas irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is considered an FGID.Table I illustrates the classification scheme used for neurogastroenterology and motility disorders, based on our current understanding of the neuroanatomical level ABSTRACT Neurogastroenterology and motility disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract encompass a broad spectrum of diseases involving the GI tract and central nervous system.They have varied pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management, and make up a substantial proportion of outpatient clinic visits.Typically, patients experience persistent symptoms referable to the GI tract despite normal endoscopic and radiologic findings.An appropriate evaluation is thus important in the patient's care.Advances in technology and understanding of the disease pathophysiology have provided better insight into the physiological basis of disease and a more rational approach to patient management.While technological advances serve to explain patients' persistent symptoms, they should be balanced against the costs of diagnostic tests.This review highlights the GI investigative modalities employed to evaluate patients with persistent GI symptoms in the absence of a structural lesion, with particular emphasis on investigative modalities available locally and the clinical impact of such tools.",

      "abstract": "Regulation of gut motility is complex and involves neuromuscular, immune and environmental mechanisms. It is well established that patients with celiac disease (CD) often display gut dysmotility. Studies have shown the presence of disturbed esophageal motility, altered gastric emptying, and dysmotility of the small intestine, gallbladder and colon in untreated CD. Most of these motor abnormalities resolve after a strict gluten-free diet, suggesting that mechanisms related to the inflammatory condition and disease process are responsible for the motor dysfunction. Motility abnormalities are also a hallmark of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where it has been proposed as underlying mechanism for symptom generation (diarrhea, constipation, bloating). Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a poorly defined entity, mostly self-diagnosed, that presents clinically with IBS symptoms in the absence of specific celiac markers. Patients with NCGS are believed to react symptomatically to wheat components, and some studies have proposed the presence of low-grade inflammation in these patients. There is little information regarding the functional characterization of these patients before and after a gluten-free diet. A study suggested the presence of altered gastrointestinal transit in NCGS patients who also have a high prevalence of nonspecific anti-gliadin antibodies. Results of an ongoing clinical study in NCGS patients with positive anti-gliadin antibodies before and after a gluten-free diet will be discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms for symptom generation in NCGS patients is important to find new therapeutic alternatives to the burden of imposing a strict gluten-free diet in patients who do not have CD.",

Exclude “non-dyspepsia” conditions and be careful in excluding a “surgical” abdomen. o Consider gastroscopy or an ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen, if alarm symptoms are present. The thresholdto investigate should be lower with older male patients as there is a higher chance of organic disease. o When patients’ symptoms are unclear, a close follow-up and review is useful. Symptoms persisting over manymonths or years are unlikely to have an organic basis. o Explore, understand and address patients’ concerns including psychological problems. Patients need to be reassured. o Sensible advice on food/meal and lifestyle modifications is useful. Antacids often give immediate relief to acutedyspeptic symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms may be atypical − a trial of PPI therapy may be useful.Patients with wind, bloating and discomfort often benefit from a course of prokinetic agents.",

      "abstract": "Regular exercise causes chronic adaptations in anatomy/physiology that provide first-line defense for disease prevention/treatment ('exercise is medicine'). However, transient changes in function that occur following each exercise bout (acute effect) are also important to consider. For example, in contrast to chronic adaptations, the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity is predominantly rooted in a prolonged acute effect (PAE) that can last up to 72 h. Untrained individuals and individuals with lower insulin sensitivity benefit more from this effect and even trained individuals with high insulin sensitivity restore most of a detraining-induced loss following one session of resumed training. Consequently, exercise to combat insulin resistance that begins the pathological journey to cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) should be prescribed with precision to elicit a PAE on insulin sensitivity to serve as a first-line defense prior to pharmaceutical intervention or, when such intervention is necessary, a potential adjunct to it.

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

There are many children as young as 1½ or 2 years of age who without any special training acquire control of the bladder and sleep through the night without bed wetting. Other children may require to be awakened once during the night to empty the bladder. Some children require a period of training in order to gain sphincteric control. Other children in spite of the most rigorous measures and apparent cooperation on the part of the parents and the child continue to be bed wetters. The problem is usually considered a functional one, a behavior disorder coming within the province of a child guidance clinic, and requiring instructions for the mother and the placing of the child on his own responsibility.

Individual reactions vary within broad limits, but, in general, may be divided into intestinal and vasomotor components. The \"intestinal\" portion of the syndrome may include hyperperistalsis, bloating, epigastric discomfort and fullness, mild cramps, borborygmi, nausea, and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhea. The vasomotor component actually distinguishes \"dumping\" from other postgastrectomy syndromes and may be manifested by weakness, dizziness, pallor, tachycardia, sweating, palpitation, and a desire to lie down. In its more severe forms, the syndrome may be totally disabling for the patient. Theories as to etiology have waxed and waned in acceptance in the past 2 decades.

      "abstract": "Abstract Restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Ekbom syndrome is characterized by abnormal and unpleasant sensations (paresthesias or dysesthesias) involving the lower extremities that become apparent or worsen at rest, especially in the evening at bedtime, and are relieved, at least transiently, with movement. Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

When there is no secondary cause, constipation is diagnosed as functional constipation. The first steps that should be taken to relieve symptoms are diet and lifestyle modifications, and if unsuccessful, laxative therapy should be initiated. If a patient does not respond to laxative therapy, diagnostic anorectal physiological tests are performed, though they are not routinely recommended. However, these tests may be considered earlier in patients strongly suspected to have a defecatory disorder.

      "abstract": "Abstract Excessive and unexplained cry is a common problem with infants. Most of the causes are benign or easily treatable, with exception of a few. However, we encountered a 5-month-old, otherwise healthy male infant, who used to cry inconsolably every day on the afternoon for about 3 hours and then used to fall asleep. This had been going on for the last 6 weeks. After waking up, infant seemed perfectly normal. History, physical examination, and routine investigations failed to diagnose the cause. An electroencephalogram showed epileptic abnormalities. The “crying episodes” disappeared after starting phenobarbitone. Although two of the four criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy (AE) are impossible to be met in an infant of this age (because he cannot speak out his ailments whether he is having abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, etc.); still we believe that this was a case of AE. Various case reports have stated that “sustained response to anticonvulsants has been accepted as one of the criteria for the diagnosis of AE.” We suggest AE to be kept in mind even when dealing with an infant of unresolved excessive crying.",

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

      "abstract": "The physiology and pathophysiology of small bowel motility are reviewed with particular focus on the motility patterns and periods that are detected by intraluminal manometry. Motility patterns are groups of phasic pressure waves resulting from contractions of the circular muscle layer of the small bowel that are organized by the enteric nervous system. Phase III of the migrating motor complex, the hallmark of the fasting motility period, thus reflects enteric neuromuscular function. Response to meal challenge also involves the CNS, reflexes beyond the gut and endocrine responses. Although specific disease diagnosis cannot be made by motility studies of the small bowel, the functional integrity is revealed. The normal occurrence of the essential patterns and periods of motility and the absence of distinctly abnormal patterns evidence preserved function, whereas the opposite indicates clinically significant dysmotility. Certain motility patterns are occasionally seen both in health and disease, and increased prevalence indicates a moderate dysfunction of yet unclear significance. Bacterial overgrowth with Gram‐negative bacilli is the consequence of severe small bowel dysmotility, and a diagnosis that can be predicted by a motility study. Testing can be useful in the clinical management of paediatric and adult patients also by predicting the prognosis and response to enteral nutrition and medical therapy. Further studies are, however, needed to take full advantage of motility testing in clinical practise.",

Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

We describe sleep starts occurring repetitively in three epileptic children with spastic-dystonic diplegia and mental retardation. Repetitive sleep starts began at age 18 months in two children and at 9 months in the third. All three children had had feto-neonatal asphyxia; two presented with spastic and one with dystonic tetraparesis. One had West syndrome and two had partial motor seizures in the first year of life. Seizures were controlled in all three patients by antiepileptic drug therapy. Video/EEG recordings of all the children during the afternoon nap revealed clusters of sleep starts during the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Cluster lasted 4-15 min and comprised from twenty to twenty-nine contractions. The EEG counterpart of the event sometimes showed an arousal response, at times inducing complete awakening. Repetitive sleep starts should be recognized and clearly differentiated from epileptic seizures, especially if they appear in epileptic subjects. In neurologically compromised patients, they could represent an intensification of an otherwise normal event, due to the lack of strong inhibitory influence of the pyramidal tract resulting from the pyramidal lesion.",

At least three types of circadian rhythm abnormalities have been described in such patients: blunting of circadian rhythms' amplitudes, advanced position (or even nonentrainment) of circadian rhythms' phases, and doubling of the length of the sleep-wake cycle from 24 to 48 h. Several types of experiments indicate that alterations in the timing of sleep and wakefulness relative to other circadian rhythms (i.e., changes in internal phase relationships) may trigger the onset or offset of episodes of depression and mania. Whether drugs used to treat manic-depressive illness act through their effects on the circadian system is currently being investigated. Direct manipulations of the circadian system are also being investigated as new approaches to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) son enfermedades psiquiátricas complejas, multicausadas, que afectan principalmente a adolescentes y mujeres jóvenes. El diagnóstico más frecuente durante la adolescencia es el de TCA no especificado, seguido por el de anorexia nervosa y bulimia nervosa. Todos estos trastornos comparten síntomas cardinales tales como la preocupación excesiva por la comida, peso y/o figura corporal y el uso de medidas no saludables para controlar o reducir el peso corporal. Los TCA muchas veces se acompañan de complicaciones médicas así como psicológicas que potencialmente pueden dejar secuelas irreversibles para el desarrollo del adolescente. Para evitar la cronicidad del trastorno, se recomienda un tratamiento temprano lo cual requiere de un diagnóstico y derivación oportunos a un equipo especializado. Este equipo requiere ser interdisciplinario con experiencia tanto en TCA como en adolescencia, para poder abarcar las diversas facetas del trastorno así como las particularidades y desafíos que implica su aparición durante la adolescencia. Eating disorders (ED) are complex psychiatric illnesses with multiple factors involved in their development and maintenance. These disorders mainly affect to adolescents and young women. The most frequent diagnosis during adolescence is ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), followed by anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. All these disorders share core symptoms such as an extreme concern about eating, weight and/or body image, and inappropriate behaviors to control or reduce weight. ED very often conduce to medical and psychiatric complications that can led permanent effects on the adolescent health. Early treatment is crucial in order to prevent chronicity This is possible with a timely and appropriate diagnosis and reference to a specialist team. This team should be interdisciplinary with experience in both ED and adolescence to manage the different aspects of these disorders and the challenges and especial characteristics of its adolescent onset.",

      "title": "Sleep deprivation and hallucinations. A qualitative study of military personnel",
      "abstract": "Much anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation not only impairs performance, but also brings about other extraordinary effects like hallucinations. However, knowledge about how sleep deprivation may trigger hallucinations is limited. To qualitatively describe hallucinatory experiences during sleep deprivation 12 male military officers from the Norwegian Armed Forces who all had experienced at least one sleep loss-induced hallucinatory experience were recruited. Data were collected and analyzed by semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This resulted in the identification of three distinct main themes: (1) Modalities, (2) circumstances/triggers and (3) reactions to hallucinations. Hallucinations were experienced in several modalities (visual, auditory and multi-modality), although visual hallucinations seemed to dominate. Typical reported circumstances/triggers were sleep loss, physical exhaustion, time-of-day, low calorie intake, mental exhaustion and lack of external stimuli (low sensory and social input, boring situations, and monotonous activity). Negative emotions were dominant during the hallucinatory episodes. Often some reasoning and checking on behalf of the officers were necessary to differentiate between real percepts and hallucinations. In some cases the hallucinations caused erroneous actions. Retrospectively, most officers viewed their hallucinatory experiences in light of positive emotions and several emphasized having learned something from them. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and suggestions for future studies are outlined.",

      "title": "Acupuncture treatment for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or return to sleep after waking up too early. As a result, a person may wake up feeling unrefreshed and fatigued. This condition can lower the energy levels and impact ones mood. The amount of sleep needed varies for each person, but most adults require between 7 and 9 hours per night. Many adults experience short-term insomnia at some point, lasting for days or weeks. However, some individuals suffer from long-term insomnia, known as chronic insomnia. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), insomnia is more than just difficulty sleeping—it reflects an imbalance between Yin and Yang, the opposing forces that regulate the body's natural rhythms. Yin, which symbolizes coolness, nourishment, and rest, dominates the night, while Yang, linked to warmth, energy, and alertness, governs the day. When this balance is disrupted, the body has trouble shifting between wakefulness and rest, resulting in sleep disturbances. In this research paper is about eighteen years old girl who suffer from insomnia around 6 months. She is a high school student, and she goes to school in shifts. She uses melatonin as a therapy for this problem, and another health problem she has is an allergy to flowers and grass. When she came to our center for TCM, she slept for 3-5 hours and usually fell asleep in the early morning hours around 5-6 am. So far, he has had a total of 16 acupuncture treatments. The first 9 treatments were done more frequently, every second or third day, and then when the situation improved, she continued with the treatments once a week. After acupuncture treatments, the patient feels better, she sleeps 5-6 hours at night and also sleeps during the day. When she is on the second shift at school, she sleeps up to 8-9 hours at night. Acupuncture is often used as a treatment for insomnia and gives positive results.",

So-called medication-overuse headache1 (MOH) is common, affecting approximately 1.5–3.0% of the population and is also regarded as a major cause of disability in adults under the age of 50 years.2 This editorial will discuss how to avoid MOH and provide alternative treatment strategies.\n\nMOH (also known as rebound-headache) is a secondary headache disorder, defined as: ‘Headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months.’ 1\n\nMOH has no distinguishable features and therefore mirrors the pre-existing primary headache for which analgesics are being used.\n\nMOH typically occurs in patients with a background of primary headache who regularly use analgesics. In approximately two-thirds of patients there is a background of migraine and, in a third, tension-type headache. Medication-overuse headache is rare in patients with cluster headache.

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological problem and encompasses a variety of functional, anatomical, and pathological disturbances. Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

The predominant feature of this impairment was a supernormal rate of unreinforced (S(Delta)) behavior. Shocks delivered without exteroceptive warning also led to a discriminative breakdown. The effect was a direct function of shock intensity. When behavior was strongly suppressed in the third stimulus by response-correlated shock (\"punishment\"), instead of unavoidable shock, breakdowns were only temporary; as soon as responding recovered from its overall suppression, discriminative performance returned to normal. The discriminative deterioration may be interpreted as an emotional by-product of frequent aversive stimulation, but accidental contingencies could also have played a role.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The results of diagnostic tests do not correlate well with the presence and severity of pain. To avoid missing a serious underlying condition, look for red flags, such as unexplained weight loss or acute bladder or bowel function changes in a patient with low back pain. Nonopioid medications can be more effective than opioids for certain types of pain (for example, antidepressants or anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain). When NSAIDs are indicated, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are better choices for patients who are at risk for GI problems or who are receiving anticoagulants. However, if nonspecific NSAIDs are not contraindicated, consider using these far less expensive agents. The tricyclic antidepressants are more effective as analgesics than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. When opioids are indicated, start with less potent agents (tramadol, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone) and then progress to stronger ones (hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, morphine) if needed.",

      "abstract": "Objetivos: Revisión del síndrome Marchiafava-Bignami como diagnóstico diferencial en paciente con consumo de alcohol y sintomatología neurológica. Material y Métodos: Paciente de 45 años, consumidor crónico de alcohol, que ingresa en Medicina Interna por cuadro de tres semanas de evolución de deterioro físico con rigidez, pérdida de fuerza, pérdida de apetito y caídas frecuentes secundarias a debilidad en miembros inferiores. Esta sintomatología se acompaña de alucinaciones visuales y alteraciones sensoperceptivas que describen los familiares como intentos de trepar por el techo como si fuera una araña. En este tiempo parece haber empeorado la coordinación de la marcha hasta imposibilitar la deambulación y se ha incrementado la inquietud y dificultades del sueño. A la exploración destaca temblor de reposo, inestabilidad de la marcha que finalmente imposibilitaba la bipedestación, discurso incoherente fluctuante con episodios de desorientación y memoria a corto plazo conservada, déficit de atención y afectación anímica de larga evolución. Resultados: Durante el ingreso sufrió crisis convulsiva así como varios episodios de agitación psicomotriz, realizándose analítica de sangre que mostraba alteraciones compatibles con consumo de alcohol, serología negativa, TAC de cráneo, tórax, abdomen y pelvis en el que solo se objetivaron varices esofágicas y EEG con lentificación de ondas. Finalmente se realizó RNM que mostró hiperintensidad en esplenio del cuerpo calloso compatible con el diagnóstico de Marchiafava-Bignami. Conclusiones: La enfermedad de Marchiafava-Bignami es una encefalopatía que consiste en la desmielinización y necrosis del cuerpo calloso poco frecuente e infradiagnosticada, ya que se solapa con múltiples patologías, siendo necesario un alto índice de sospecha y la realización de una RNM como herramienta diagnóstica. Dada la gravedad de esta patología, es importante conocer la enfermedad y sospecharla en todo paciente alcohólico con alteración neurológica grave con el fin de realizar un diagnóstico precoz, un abordaje adecuado y poder ofrecer cuidados de calidad.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of obesity.",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a metabolic disorder conditioned by several factors with the individual genetic proneness to accumulation of body fat with a positive energetic balance. If such definition describes the essential nature of obesity aptly, the treatment thereof ought to be the realm of somatic medicine and somatically oriented physicians, which is, unfortunately, frequently the case. Yet, not only being a disorder concerning improper body composition, but also a difference in cognitive processes and emotions of the obese, obesity needs to be considered in a more complex manner. The life of the obese consists of periods of strict, starvation diets on one hand and total loss of control and excessive calorie intake. Therefore, the corresponding therapy also needs to be provided in a more complex fashion, i.e. it is not solely the somatic disorder that should be addressed, but also the emotions and cognitions which induce the undesirable behaviour. Generally, it is possible to summarise that cognition and emotions are likely to be anticipated, directed and controlled by affecting the stimuli promoting the erratic attitude. Thanks to the achievements which relate not only to loss of weight, but also to higher self-esteem, more gratifying feelings aroused by the patients self, improvement of both physical and mental conditions and enhancement of the quality of life as a whole, the new behaviour patterns are established, strengthened and sustained on a long-term basis. Several psychotherapeutic attitudes/methods may be used with cognitive-behavioral therapy, existential therapy and, recently, psychodynamic approach. The psychologists role is essential and fundamental in both conservative and the metabolic-bariatric treatment of obesity. The most common character traits of obese patients include predominantly neuroticism, which comprises anxiety, depressions, impulsiveness, anger and hostility. Likewise, obesity is often suffered from by children and adolescents and its treatment relies on, in like manner as with adults, an active change of unsuitable dietary and movement habits with the family of the patient and their motivation of the patient to make the desirable change. It needs to be noted, however, that except for the changes in lifestyle, treatment of psychological difficulties accompanying obesity is a part of psychotherapy of such a group of young and adolescent patients.",

The give is sometimes fairly early in passive movement, when it is a reflex response to increased tension in the muscle, or it may be late in the passive movement when it is a response to lengthening of the muscle.",

It has also been described as autonomic dysreflexia, hypertensive autonomic crisis [1], and neurovegetative syndrome of visceral dysfunction [1], as well as “mass reflex” because of its unchecked, excessive, and generalized reaction. It appears in 85% of patients 2 to 3 weeks after the initial episode of an acute spinal lesion above the level of T7. It is produced, sometimes with remarkable ease, in response to stimuli below the level of the spinal cord lesion. These stimuli include distention of the viscera such as bladder, bowel, or intestine, cutaneous stimulation [2], such as tight clothing and strapping, uterine contractions, lower extremity and even upper extremity surgery [3], sexual intercourse [1], and urogenital pathology [1,4]. Urological procedures resulting in autonomic hyperreflexia include cystoscopy, urodynamic studies, extracorporeal lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy [5], renal pelvic stone removal [6], electroejaculation [7], and nephrectomy [8].",

      "title": "28.1 VARIETIES OF SELF DISORDER: A BIO-PHENO-SOCIAL MODEL OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "The self-disorder model offers a unifying way of conceptualizing schizophrenia’s highly diverse symptoms (positive, negative, disorganized), of capturing their distinctive bizarreness, and of conceiving their longitudinal development. These symptoms are viewed as differing manifestations of an underlying disorder of ‘core-self’: hyperreflexivity/diminished-self presence with accompanying disturbances of “grip” or “hold” on reality. We have recently revised and tested this phenomenological model, in particular distinguishing primary versus-secondary factors, in offering a bio-pheno-social model of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The revised model is consistent with recent empirical findings and offers several advantages: 1) It helps account for the temporal variations of the symptoms or syndrome, including longitudinal progression, but also the shorter-term, situationally-reactive, sometimes defensive, and possibly quasi-agentive variability of symptom-expression that can occur in schizophrenia (consistent with understanding some aspects of self-disturbance as dynamic and mutable, involving shifting attitudes or experiential orientations). 2) It accommodates the overlapping of some key schizophrenic symptoms with certain non-schizophrenia spectrum conditions involving dissociation (depersonalization and derealization), including Depersonalization Disorder and Panic Disorder, thereby acknowledging both shared and distinguishing symptoms. 3) It integrates recent neurocognitive, neurobiological, and psychosocial (e.g., influence of trauma and culture) findings into a coherent but multi-factorial neuropsychological account. An adequate model of schizophrenia will postulate shared disturbances of core-self experiences that nevertheless can follow several distinct pathways and occur in various forms. Such a model is preferable to uni-dimensional alternatives—whether of schizophrenia or core self disturbance—given its ability to account for distinctive yet varying experiential and neurocognitive abnormalities found in research on schizophrenia, and to integrate these with recent psychosocial as well as neurobiological findings.",

Traditionally and quite soundly it is considered that FD concerns group of psychosomatic diseases, however in its pathogenesis the big role is taken away to local motor disturbances (an antroduodenal dyscoordination owing to a disbalance of intestinal neuromediators and gastrointestinal hormones), and also to behavior factors (an alimentary stereotype, alcohol and a tobacco smoking) and to a chronic lesion of intramural nervous plexuses of a digestive tube by toxins of a pathological intestinal microflora.

      "abstract": "Bedwetting is the most common urologic complaint among children. Wetting frequency decreases from birth to adolescence. Etiology is multifactorial : genetic, neuromuscular or urologic maturation, psychosocial stressors, toilet training, or biologic aspects. Treatment has been also multimodal : drugs to depress bladder activity, increase urethral resistance, or modulate sleep. and recently urine reduction modulation. All of these approaches reflect a lack of sufficient knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis. Recent researches have focused on sleep disturbances, bladder reservoir function, urine output, and a combination of the three. Sleep studies indicate that enuretic patients are normal sleepers, and enuresis can take place during any stage of sleep, but generally occurs when the bladder is filled to the equivalent of maximal daytime functional capacity. Bladder reservior capacity appears to be normal, and bladder instability is somewhat related with the pathology of nocturnal enuresis. However, enuretic patients have shown the lack of normal nocturnal increase in antidiuretic hormone levels, and nocturnal urine production increases up to 2-4 times volume of functional bladder capacity, which explains the need for bladder emptying. But behavioral approaches, especially Bell-alarm method, remain important in the treatment of primary enuresis.",

Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe.

Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

Moreover, our understanding of its etiology, comorbidities, and diagnosis is still premature. We performed a literature review in Medline/PubMed to identify all the studies proposing a management plan for NES and summarized all the existing data on its diagnosis and treatment.Expert opinion: To date, none of the proposed treatment options for NES have been promising and long-term data on its efficacy is lacking. The slow growth of evidence on this debilitating but underreported condition may be due to unawareness among clinicians, under-reporting by patients, and unrecognized diagnostic criteria. Objective screening of symptoms during office visits especially for patients at a high-risk for NES will identify more patients suffering from the syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Autobiographical memory is a form of episodic memory characterized by a sense of time and consciousness that enables an individual to subjectively re-experience his or her past. As part of this mental re-enactment, the past is recognized relative to the present. Dysfunction of this memory system may lead to confusion regarding the present perception of time.Two Japanese women (42 and 55 years old) temporarily believed they were living in their past during a course of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Their autobiographical memories and behaviour reflected their self-estimated age, and they could not recall memories experienced beyond that age. More surprisingly, their subjective age estimations and autobiographical memories were transiently corrected when they were made aware of their true age. Disorientation, anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia were common additional symptoms. Neuroimaging suggested disturbances in medial temporal and orbitofrontal brain regions in both cases.This syndrome is characterized by three elements: 1) failure to subjectively recognize the present; 2) inability to suppress irrelevant past memories; and 3) transient restitution of awareness of the present through realization of the individual's true age. We defined this syndrome as 'autobiographical age awareness disturbance', and focused our investigation on the role of age self-awareness. If recall of relevant and suppression of irrelevant past memories are both necessary to subjectively recognize the present relative to the past, dysfunction of medial temporal and orbitofrontal brain regions is predicted to lead to abnormal subjective placement in time. However, the subjective experience of age tends to be an important informational component for retrieving remote autobiographical memories. This suggests that correct age awareness is essential for the proper recognition of the remote past in relation to the present. This is the first report to focus on the relationship between subjective temporal orientation and age self-awareness. While the role of age awareness in this process is still unclear, investigating autobiographical age awareness disturbance as a part of subjective temporal awareness dysfunction can be useful in understanding the processes underlying human time recognition.",

      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

Both types of experiences are arousal-state bound and stage (set and setting) or culture bound. Flashbackers may be characterized by (1) their variability (large SD) on perceptual-behavioural tasks pointing to their extensive cognitive or interpretive repertoire, (2) they are minimizers (or reducers) of sensory input (particularly at the peak of a hallucinogenic drug experience), (3) as a group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and experience), (3) as group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and hence (5) prefer righ cerebral hemispheric cognition, (6) displaying EEG-alpha dominance in the resting, waking state. Flashback and hypnotic recall differ only in the ways and means by which they are induced. Hypnotic induction, however, is not to be confused with the induced state that may be any ordinary or non-ordinary state of consciousness on the perception-hallucination-meditation continuum which the subject has a least once experienced before. If mind is an open system comprising the individual's mind and the minds of his total environment, i.e. his past and present sets and settings, then for many of us thoughts and actions are hypnotically induced, and memories are flashbacks of those experiences.",

      "title": "0855 A challenging case of nocturnal visual hallucinations in an elderly woman",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Nocturnal hallucinations can be part of a wide array of different disorders, like sleep disorders (e.g. narcolepsy), visual impairment (e.g. Charles-Bonnet syndrome), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Lewy Body Dementia) and psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). We explore the differential diagnosis, the challenging diagnostic workup and the limited therapeutic options in this patient with complex visual nocturnal hallucinations. Report of Cases: A 64 year old woman was referred with detailed and vivid visual nocturnal hallucinations (seeing her dog smoking a cigar, seeing someone in the room moving her bed, etc.). The hallucinations started 1-2 months ago, were mainly present at night (both when falling asleep and during the night) but occasionally also during the day. She had also been suffering from worsening daytime sleepiness for 3-4 months, and from memory problems for 1 year. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis were absent. Clinical neurological examination was normal. The patient had been diagnosed in the past with OSAS. She had been treated with CPAP for 3 years and recent polysomnography showed good control of her apnea. She had also been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, COPD and cardiomyopathy. Because of her age, the vivid hallucinations, and the memory problems, we first wanted to rule out Lewy Body Dementia. Neuropsychological testing ruled out dementia. MRI of the brain showed some white matter lesions, without substantial atrophy. At a subsequent multidisciplinary consultation, her cardiologist considered her cardiomyopathy as a contraindication for stimulants. Therefore, and because we believed the a priori probability for narcolepsy to be low, an additional MSLT was not considered useful. Based on further pulmonary tests, we hypothesized that hypoxia could play a role in the hallucinations and hypersomnolence. The hallucinations improved over time, the hypersomnolence remained, but we found there were no good treatment options available, considering the cardiac contraindications for stimulants. Conclusion There is a wide-ranging differential diagnosis for nocturnal visual hallucinations. The specific patient characteristics are important both for further diagnosis and treatment options.

A 28-year-old female patient with a history of depression was admitted to emergency department an hour after ingestion of bupropion, quetiapine, and levothyroxine in high doses to commit suicide. While accepting her into the Intensive Care Unit, she was awake, alert, disoriented and agitated. After 2h, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The necessary treatment was given and 9h later with hemodynamic improvement, the patients' mental status improved.

The most common forms of pica are geophagia or soil consumption and pagophagia or ice consumption. Similar to other medical symptoms such as fever and anemia, pica is a symptom caused by multiple factors, being iron and zinc deficiencies the most frequent associations, where the physician, rather than treat it, must identify the intimate cause which is associated with, and correct it, as is possible in most cases of pica. Pica, despite being a symptom, according to the type and intensity, can cause morbidity and mortality. Among the complications associated with pica are electrolyte disorders, obstruction and damage of the digestive tract by some types of pica, such as geophagy and trichophagia, and pica of foreign objects such as plastics and velcro. Its diagnosis, which only consists in questioning this practice to patients or their caregivers, in the case of children and patients with mental illness, is usually ignored in the care of patients, most likely due to ignorance of the health team about this disorder, or lack of time during the medical consultation. The aim of this module is to call attention to this cardinal clinical sign, so that latent problems can be identified early, even before the underlying disease manifests or the complications associated with it.",

      "abstract": "Obsessions (e.g. usually associated with blasphemous thoughts) dominate the psyche of those afflicted with OCD until relief comes with a connected compulsive activity (i.e., another thought process, or action). OCD is disabling as to the time and mental energy it consumes. The disorder is characterized by repeated hand washing (the “Pontius Pilot Syndrome”), checking, and ordering. In some instances, these symptoms of OCD can have positive overtones and make a more productive and exacting worker. For example, dentist with OCD probably does more accurate restorations due to a “checker” inclination. Professions depending on industriousness and problem-solving like physician or scientist are custom-made for those with OCD. However, severe observable symptomology and often a dehabilitating decrease in functionality usually occur in those with the disorder. Nonetheless, those afflicted with OCD are quite skilled at hiding their symptoms from others; often including their employer or spouse. In addition, those with OCD usually have one or more depressive episodes or must also deal with chronic depression.

This paroxysmal EEG activity was consistently accentuated unilaterally over the superior frontal regions. The first patient showed ictal aphasia and occasional right hemiparesis during these episodes, and partial left frontal lobectomy resulted in temporary freedom from seizures. The classification of these ictal episodes is difficult. They apparently fall into the category of absence status (petit mal status), but the focal neurological signs do not fit the presently valid definitions of absence status, nor does the lack of symmetrical bilateral-synchronous paroxysmal discharges. Perhaps a special category of status epilepticus should be established.",

Still, if irregular work hours cannot be avoided, fatigue may be reduced through strategic sleeping (including naps), coffee intake, and phase adjustment through light or melatonin (not properly evaluated yet, though). As a complement, alertness may be protected through increasing the level of stimulation in the work situation. This may be accomplished through changing work tasks, controlled noise, light physical activity or interaction with work mates. To some extent also cold air, fresh air, and bright light may be effective. However, it should be emphasized that increased stimulation is effective only for as long as the stimulation is applied.

      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation.

Describe the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of apnea.\n\n3. Characterize the findings of long-term follow-up of infants who have apnea.\n\nAlthough apnea typically results from immaturity of the respiratory control system (see accompanying article in this issue), it also may be the presenting sign of other diseases or pathophysiologic states that frequently affect preterm infants. A thorough consideration of possible causes is always warranted, especially when there is an unexpected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea or bradycardia (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \nMultiple etiologic factors that may contribute to apnea in preterm infants.

Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression.

What is often disregarded by health professionals is that information-giving is often insufficient in supporting maintainable, substantial changes. Making long-term alterations to one9s lifestyle is challenging regardless of one9s circumstances. However, in the context of managing a chronic health condition one is faced with psychological barriers of a specific kind. Individuals with chronic health conditions may dislike being reminded of their physical difficulties, but adhering to a new 9healthier9 schedule means that one remains vigilant of daily choices and is consequently more aware of the underlying health condition. This awareness may result in undesirable emotional states such as sadness or anxiety that one might find difficult to handle. In an effort to then avoid, deny, or numb oneself from the worries or reminders of the chronic illness, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The presentation will introduce mindfulness techniques for identifying and better handling undesirable thoughts, emotions and physical sensations that may act as barriers to healthier lifestyles. It will also discuss ways for initiating and maintaining internally motivated lifestyle changes though the activation of one9s personal values rather than acting on mandates of others such as family members or health professionals. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared <h3>DOI</h3> 10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-eular.6127",

      "abstract": "(1) There are cases of acute excitement that are classified under several headings with apparently no recognition as to the uniformity of symptomatology. These cases have been diagnosed as Bell's Mania, typhomania, acute delirious mania (manic-depressive psychosis), delirium grave, acute delirium, specific febrile delirium, and collapse delirium. (2) Luther Bell described these cases in 1849 and the description is slightly modified as follows: There is a sudden onset; exceedingly great overactivity; marked sleeplessness; great push of speech with statements that are disconnected at times by reason of the rapidity of flow; disconnected and poorly systematized delusions; transient hallucinations that border on illusions; appearance of confusion, but when one insists that the patient answer the questions, the patient can \"suspend the intellectual wanderings\" long enough to answer correctly as to orientation. The course of the illness is from three to six weeks, with a fatal termination in a large percentage of cases, apparently from cardio-vascular failure due to overactivity. The cases that recover have no after symptoms. No pathological evidence of note has been found by later workers. (3) Treatment is recommended in the form of sufficient sedative, regardless of the dosage, to enable the patient to get some rest. In our case ordinary sedatives failed and though over 125 grains of sodium amytal were given in three days the patient slept comparatively little. However, the overexcitement was quelled. (4) For the sake of clarity in the studying of this group, and until more definite findfngs are brought forth, it is suggested that these cases be called Bell's Mania, after the original observer.",

      "abstract": "Ventilation is disturbed in sleep even in healthy individuals. In rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) disburbances in ventilation are coupled to phasic events. In 10 normal subjects respiratory frequency was found to be positively correlated and rib cage motion was inversely correlated with eye movement density during REMS. Abdominal motion was little affected, and hence the adverse effects of phasic events on overall ventilation were limited. Ventilation during non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) is characterized by regular periodicities. 'Itro mechanisms are thought to be involved. First, instability of the chemical feedback system caused by high overall loop gain leads to ventilatory oscillations. Second, removal of the wakefulness stimulus leads to reductions in ventilation at sleep onset. It is likely that these two mechanisms interact to produce periodicities in ventilation during early stage 1-2 NREMS. Ventilation is commonly disturbed in sleep. This both occurs in normal individuals, and is particularly severe in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The mechanisms underlying this are likely to be different in the different stages of sleep. In rapid eye-movement sleep, the disturbances are coupled to the phasic events that occur in this state. One method to measure these phasic events is by recording rapid eye-movements. We have developed a method to examine the interrelationship between ventilation and its components and eye-movements. This method is based on computing separately a running average of ventilation and its components and eye movement density (number of eye movements/second). The window length of the running average, the degree of overlap between adjacent windows and the delay (or lag) between the ventilation and eye movement measures is adjustable. The latter is to allow for asynchrony between the ventilatory changes and the occurrence of eye movements. We have found that a window length of",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’.

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

Methods： Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results： The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder.

      "title": "Optimizing Energy Supply by Parenteral Nutrition in the Critically-Ill: Muscle Weakness and its Monitoring",
      "abstract": "Critical illness is mostly defined as a life-threatening process\r\naffecting numerous systems of the body [1]. Unfortunately, despite\r\nall implemented strategies, critical illness could be associated with\r\nsignificant morbidity or mortality [2,3]. Although the early signs of\r\ncritical illness are commonly neglected, a period of physiological\r\nweakening usually heralds the situation. Very clinical staff and even\r\nvisitors play a pivotal role throughout appropriate assessment and\r\nintervention steps [4].\r\nMuscle weakness in the critically-ill, as a major complication in\r\nICUs, is associated with increased length of ICU stay and mortality.\r\nIt has recently been suggested that substantial macronutrient deficit\r\nat early stages of the critical illness does not necessarily affect muscle\r\nwasting [5]. Numerous variables could directly contribute to the\r\nmuscle weakness of the critically-ill patients following Neuromuscular\r\nBlocking Drugs (NMBDs) administration including the dosage,\r\nadministration method (intermittent vs. bolus) and duration and also\r\nthe approaches used for monitoring neuromuscular block depth. The\r\nlatter seems to be inevitable, especially in the critically-ill patients, in\r\norder to guide the proper administration of drugs, avoid overdosing,\r\nmaintain muscle activity and detect reactions among concomitant\r\nmedications or pathophysiologic changes [6]. Based on the recent\r\nguidelines NMBDs are recommend to be used in critically-ill patients\r\nonly when absolutely necessary, the depth of muscle paralysis be\r\nmonitored to avoid overdosing and metabolite accumulation, and that\r\ndrug administration be curtailed periodically to allow interruption of\r\nsustained NMBDs effect [7].\r\nFurthermore, late parenteral regimen has also been suggested to be\r\nconsidered as a model of caloric restriction which would be associated\r\nwith the elimination of damaged organelles [8]. However, it should\r\nbe taken into consideration that insulin resistance in the criticallyill\r\npatients results in an unavoidable increase in glucose production,\r\nup to 1500 kcal/day in acute phase after injury. Therefore, the caloric\r\ndebt during the acute phase of critical illness should no longer be\r\ncalculated as the difference between energy expenditure and caloric\r\nintake but rather as the difference between energy expenditure and\r\nthe sum of (endogenous+exogenous) calories [9]. Consequently,\r\nit seems that early parenteral nutrition without considering the\r\nmentioned pathophysiologic changes could result in overfeeding\r\nand its complications in other organs. Hence, prior to considering\r\nsupplemental parenteral nutrition in patients with insufficient intake,\r\noptimization of the tolerance to ideal feeding is recommended.",

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned.

Two drove away from the place of the accident, whilst the remainder ran away on foot. Three of the latter stopped cars while still in a semi-conscious condition and continued their flight in this manner. As a rule, a sharply defined amnesia occurs at a later stage; only two patients suffered from a lacunary amnesia similar to that which occurs after a concussion of the brain. There were no instances of retrograde amnesia. The shortest duration of a post-traumatic semi-conscious condition is 20 - 30 minutes; and it often lasts for many hours. An initial deep loss of consciousness does not occur as a rule and there was only one instance of it amongst these particular cases. This distinguishes the post-traumatic semi-conscious condition clearly from a commotio cerebri and it could well be a separate manifestation of a disturbed consciousness. Actions made during this semi-conscious condition appear to be motivated, and occasionally the patients carried out what they had intended to do before the accident. Thus, for example, two of the patients appeared at their places of work. The report refers to the similarity of this post-traumatic semi-conscious state with epileptic psychomotor attacks on the consciousness. The very difficult problem of a diagnostic definition to differentiate from hysteroid panic behaviour is investigated. /TRRL/",

      "title": "Emerging methods for the physiological assessment of occupational stress",
      "abstract": "Occupational stress is implicated as an etiology for a variety of diseases. Many of the etiological theories surrounding these associations incriminate some deviation of autonomic nervous system activity. New methods of analyzing cardiovascular data obtained from a Holter monitor provide a window into a worker's autonomic nervous system throughout the day, in many cases for two days. These methods allow a variety of comparisons, for example, between workers of varying job stress levels, between work days and rest days, day and night, and between high stress and low stress periods. Identifying altered autonomic nervous system activity patterns throughout the day may: 1. provide insight into the etiology of stress related pathologies; 2. allow quantification of exposure; 3. investigate possible interaction effects of different exposures; 4. lead to monitoring methods capable of identifying whether an employee's job stress is increasing his or her risk for disease.",

Very few cases are reported with this adverse effect of venlafaxine. Here is a case report where a 32 year-old male with social phobia developed delusions of persecution on two occasions when he was put on venlafaxine 150 mg/day, which responded to withdrawal of venlafaxine and a short course of antipsychotics. The delusions never reappeared when he was maintained on escitalopram.",

      "abstract": "A kora gyermekkori evészavarok közé tartozó szenzoros ételelutasítás a válogatósság egy súlyos, perzisztáló formája, melyben a gyermek következetesen és kitartóan utasít el bizonyos ételeket valamely tulajdonságaik alapján, egy vagy több korábbi averzív élményt követően. Kialakulásában biológiai adottságok (szenzoros feldolgozási zavar, fokozott ízérzékenység) és környezeti hatások együttesen játszanak szerepet. A beszűkült étrend miatt egyes tápanyagok abszolút vagy relatív hiánya fordulhat elő, de súlygyarapodási zavar nem jellemző. Az evészavar gyakran társul viselkedésproblémákkal, szorongásos zavarral, autizmus spektrum zavarral. A diagnózis a részletes anamnézis alapján már többnyire valószínűsíthető, a kivizsgálást gyermekorvosi vizsgálat, dietetikai és pszichológiai konzultáció, gyógypedagógiai felmérés egészítheti ki. A terápia alapja a szülők edukációja és támogatása elsősorban az étkezések körüli szorongás csökkentése, másodsorban pedig az ételrepertoár bővítésének és az új ételek elfogadásának lehetőségeiről való közös gondolkodás érdekében. Az interdiszciplináris ellátás keretein belül a társszakmákkal együttműködve a gyermekorvos feladata a gyarapodás és a fejlődés ellenőrzése, a tápanyagok és a vitaminok hiányának kizárása, szükség esetén ezek pótlása.

      "title": "Cardiovascular Reflexes and Autonomic Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical features of autonomic neuropathy include postural hypotension, sweating abnormalities, disturbance of body temperature regulation, gastric fullness and nausea, intermittent nocturnal diarrhoea, constipation, bladder problems and impotence. In diabetic patients, gustatory sweating and hypoglycaemic unawareness also sometimes occur (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). The onset of symptoms is usually insidious and permanent, but may occasionally be acute and reversible (Young, Asbury, Corbett &amp; Adams, 1975). Autonomic dysfunction can arise from three main causes: first, those where the damage to the autonomic nervous system is isolated, as in primary postural hypotension (Bannister, Sever &amp; Gross, 1977) and familial dysautonomia (Brunt &amp; McKusick, 1970); secondly, those caused by toxic or pharmacological agents which interfere with autonomic reflexes; thirdly, those associated with systemic disease, of which diabetes mellitus is the most common. Other diseases which may cause autonomic dysfunction include amyloidosis, porphyria, tetanus, polyneuritis, tabes dorsalis, parkinsonism, chronic renal failure and alcoholism, and occasionally autonomic neuropathy has been associated with carcinoma of the bronchus or the pancreas (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). Although it is possible to localize lesions within the autonomic nervous system to afferent or efferent sympathetic or parasympathetic pathways (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974; Moskowitz, 1977), many of the available tests are complex and invasive and often lack adequate control measurements (Young et al., 1975). Because of the patchy nature of autonomic neuropathy, current interest has centred around the search for bedside tests that are ‘global’, reproducible and non-invasive. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge of simple tests of cardiovascular reflex function in the clinical evaluation of autonomic neuropathy, particularly in diabetic subjects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Vertigo is an episodic phenomenon, whereas nonvestibular dizziness is often continuous. An exception would be presyncopal light-headedness caused by postural hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with psychophysiologic dizziness often report being dizzy from morning to night without changes for months to years at a time. Vertigo is typically aggravated by head movements, whereas nonvestibular dizziness is often aggravated by movement of visual targets. Episodes of dizziness induced by position change suggest a vestibular lesion if postural hypotension has been ruled out. Although stress can aggravate both vestibular and nonvestibular dizziness, dizziness that is reliably precipitated by stress suggests a nonvestibular cause. Finally, episodes of dizziness occurring only in specific situations (e.g., driving on the freeway, entering a crowded room, or shopping in a busy supermarket) suggest a nonvestibular cause.",

A positive link between diet and the development of mental disorders is reflected in a strong correlation between the intake of refined sugars and decrease bet awareness of patients with schizophrenia and the development of depression. Mental changes during aging and gradual separation from active social life are usually emotionally reflect the first stage of aging escape into the food, and in the second phase, after 75 years of lethargy, when the food loses its appeal.

      "abstract": "Although abdominal pain is a symptom of several structural gastrointestinal disorders (eg, peptic ulcer disease), this comprehensive review will focus on the 4 most common nonstructural, or functional, disorders associated with abdominal pain: functional dyspepsia, constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, and functional abdominal pain syndrome. Together, these conditions affect approximately 1 in 4 people in the United States. They are associated with comorbid conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and depression), impaired quality of life, and increased health care utilization. Symptoms are explained by disordered gastrointestinal motility and sensation, which are implicated in various peripheral (eg, postinfectious inflammation and luminal irritants) and/or central (eg, stress and anxiety) factors. These disorders are defined and can generally be diagnosed by symptoms alone. Often prompted by alarm features, selected testing is useful to exclude structural disease. Identifying the specific diagnosis (eg, differentiating between functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome) and establishing an effective patient-physician relationship are the cornerstones of therapy. Many patients with mild symptoms can be effectively managed with limited tests, sensible dietary modifications, and over-the-counter medications tailored to symptoms. If these measures are not sufficient, pharmacotherapy should be considered for bowel symptoms (constipation or diarrhea) and/or abdominal pain; opioids should not be used. Behavioral and psychological approaches (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) can be helpful, particularly in patients with chronic abdominal pain who require a multidisciplinary pain management program without opioids.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

      "abstract": "Of the many behavioral disturbances to which obese persons are subject, only two seem specifically related to their obesity. One is overeating, the other is a disturbance in body image. The disturbance in body image is characterized by a feeling that one's body is grotesque and loathesome and that others view it with hostility and contempt.

As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

In a new study, 125 SD were examined on 93 depressed patients. The therapeutic benefit of SD on endogenous depression consists not only of the nightly clear up but also of provoking or improving a typical day wave the day after DS. A period of at least 36 h is necessary to survey the total effect of this method. The best results are achieved in patients with severe endogenous depression, especially in those with the typical day wave and distinct somatic symptoms. The effect of partial SD (for the second half of the night) is almost the same as that of total SD. The advantages of partial SD are: the patient can stand it easier, more often, and - in the company of a suited person - even at home. Finally, it is less complicate in clinical routine than selective REM-deprivation.",

FD is categorized into two subgroups based on symptoms: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The pathophysiology of FD involves several mechanisms. Delayed gastric emptying is observed in approximately 30% of FD patients but does not correlate with symptom patterns or severity. Impaired gastric accommodation is important in the pathophysiology, particularly for PDS. Visceral hypersensitivity, characterized by heightened sensitivity to normal activities, contributes to the perception of discomfort or pain in FD. Alterations to the duodenal mucosa, including impaired mucosal barrier function and low-grade inflammation, are also implicated in the pathogenesis of FD. Microbial dysbiosis and psychological factors such as stress can further exacerbate symptoms. Treatment options include dietary modifications, establishing a physician-patient relationship, acid suppressants, prokinetics, neuromodulators, and behavioral therapies. Dietary recommendations include eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding trigger foods. Acid suppressants are used as the first-line treatment. Prokinetics and neuromodulators aim to improve gastric motility and central pain processing, respectively. Behavioral therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, have shown benefits for refractory FD. Severe and refractory cases may require combination therapies or experimental treatments. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; FD is a disorder of gut-brain interaction involving diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Individualized treatment based on symptoms and responses to interventions is crucial. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of FD and advance the development of effective therapies.",

The transformation from the accumulator to reference memory is done with a multiplicative constant that is affected by drugs, lesions, and individual differences.

The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

      "abstract": "This study was designed to document prospectively and explore scientifically the natural course of untreated migraine attacks in detail. A new, integrated, time-intensity method for self-assessment of the intensity of symptoms was tested on 18 adult International Headache Society migraineurs who volunteered to refrain from treatment during one attack. The area under the curves (AUC) during 72 h of untreated attacks was compared with attacks treated with a triptan. Migraine attacks are heterogeneous both inter- and intra-individually. In untreated attacks, the pain can stabilize and fluctuate around a plateau with a wavelength of hours. In general, the symptoms of each separate migraine attack follow a similar temporal course, with only moderate deviations. In some cases photo- and/or phonophobia (hyperexcitability) were not experienced at all, despite severe pain and nausea. Moreover, there was sometimes no nausea despite severe pain and hyperexcitability. Vomiting does not always correlate to the intensity of nausea and is not always followed by decreased headache intensity. Treatment with a triptan usually only temporarily distorts the basic pattern of attacks. Hyperexcitability can respond before pain to treatment.

      "abstract": "<h3>To the Editor.—</h3> The report of three cases of \"withdrawal psychosis\" following abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy (237:36, 1977) could be misleading because of the use of this unfortunate term. What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

These symptoms were chiefly palpitation, shortness of breath, precordial pain or discomfort and exhaustion. One or more associated symptoms were often present: faintness, syncope, headache, dizziness, insomnia, increased perspiration, difficulty in swallowing, tremor, flushing and pallor. The borderline between the normal and the abnormal is ill defined, but neurocirculatory asthenia may be said to be present when the symptoms appear during such customary physical activities and excitements of daily life as previously caused no symptoms or which in the average person produce no symptoms.

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

Muskelkrämpfe sind sehr häufig und treten sowohl bei gesunden Menschen als auch im Rahmen von verschiedenen internistischen, rheumatologischen und neurologischen krankhaften Zuständen auf. Muskelkrämpfe bei gesunden Menschen sind selbstlimitierend und in der Regel auf körperliche Überbelastung zurückzuführen. Bei persistierenden, heftigen und therapieresistenten Muskelkrämpfen sollte eine Abklärung durchgeführt werden, wobei hier die Suche nach behandelbaren Ursachen im Vordergrund steht (z.B. mangelhafte Hydratation, muskuläre Überbelastung, Elektrolytverschiebungen, Dysthyreose, Vitaminmangel, Niereninsuffizienz, Leberzirrhose, medikamentös-toxische Nebenwirkungen etc.). Nach Ausschluss solcher symptomatischer Ursachen kann eine neurologische Abklärung zur Suche nach spezifischen neuromuskulären und neurologischen Erkrankungen sinnvoll sein. Primär sollte immer eine kausale Behandlung angestrebt werden. Auch Allgemeinmassnahmen wie Vermeiden krampfauslösender Belastungen, ausreichende Flüssigkeitszufuhr und abendliche Dehnungsübungen sollten instruiert werden. Zur symptomatischen Behandlung von Muskelkrämpfen haben mehrere Medikamente, insbesondere Magnesiumpräparate und Chininsulfat, Wirksamkeit gezeigt.

      "abstract": "Insomnia may be categorized as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. The ideal hypnotic must promote rapid sleep onset and maintain sleep throughout the night while allowing the patient to awake refreshed the following day. Several benzodiazepines, with differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are presently available. All are clinically effective and not only elimination half-life but also dosage prescribed and pattern of distribution are important factors for determining treatment response. Hypnotics have been divided into those with long elimination half-lives (e.g. nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam), those with intermediately long half-lives (brotizolam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam) and those with short half-lives (midazolam and triazolam). Carry-over effects into the morning such as excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsiness are related to drug half-life, dosage and pattern of distribution. In equipotent dosages most controlled clinical trials have found no significant differences between the various benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nevertheless, clinicians in general tend to use long half-life benzodiazepines in patients who have difficulties maintaining sleep and short half-life benzodiazepines for treating sleep onset insomnia. Intermediately long half-life, benzodiazepines are used for both indications and most clinicians feel that the choice of hypnotic should not only be influenced by elimination half-life or the dosage used, but by individual patient preference. Hypnotics should be used for only short periods of time and in those patients for whom a more chronic use is indicated, they should be used only on an intermittent basis.",

Her behavior is an attempt to exert control and self-direction, usually through the regulation of food intake. Weight loss is the most common symptom of the disease and, when extreme, can be life-threatening. Although anorexia nervosa is usually considered a psychologic disorder, strong evidence for biologic relationships exists. Therapy includes both medical treatment and some form of psychotherapy. However, while acute problems often respond to medical intervention, many aspects of the anorectic condition are relatively refractory and some patients continue to have problems for much of their lives.",

Refractory delirium, dyspnoea or pain are the most common indications. If deep palliative sedation is used, the estimated life expectancy should be a few days to at most one week. Midazolam is used most often for continuous sedation, usually by subcutaneous infusion; if the response is insufficient, a combination of midazolam with levomepromazine or phenobarbital or monotreatment with propofol may be used. If continuous infusion is not desired or feasible, intermittent administration of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam or chlorpromazine may be considered.

Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology.

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

      "title": "Anorexia nervosa or starvation?",
      "abstract": "Is this related to anorexia nervosa or to starvation? Every individual conducting research in anorexia nervosa (AN) has undoubtedly asked themselves this question. AN is an incredibly difficult illness to research as it is fundamentally a mental illness but results in very serious physical consequences. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), AN is characterised by a disturbance of body image and a restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A significant change in physical state (i.e. significant weight loss) is thus a core diagnostic criterion. Thus, diagnosis of AN is dependent on an individual starving themselves to achieve a significant reduction in their body weight. Starvation results in undeniable physiological changes throughout the body, including the brain. As a consequence, essentially all research undertaken in AN, with the exception of some fields such as genetics, is influenced to some degree by the malnourished state of patients. An additional complexity is that some people with AN also engage in binging and purging as well as other strategies to lose weight, including excessive exercise. Disentangling whether findings are due to the illness itself, or are epiphenomena consequent upon starvation is an exceptionally difficult task. In an attempt to control for the effects of starvation on research findings, individuals who are weight-restored or recovered from AN are often assessed rather than acutely unwell and underweight patients. To date, this is perhaps the most widely used method to overcome this confound. However, the long-term effects of starvation on the brain are relatively unknown (Phillipou, Rossell, & Castle, 2014), leaving us essentially in the same position as assessing underweight patients. To identify whether research findings are a result of the illness or a consequence of starvation, a control group of healthy individuals who have been deprived adequate nutrition for a sustained period of time would be required. In modern times, this would indisputably be considered unethical. However, prior to the introduction of strict ethical standards, a number of human starvation studies were undertaken. The most famous of these is the Minnesota Starvation Experiment conducted by Keys et al. (1950) in which 36 young males underwent partial starvation for 6 months. A number of physiological and psychological variables were monitored and assessed throughout this period, many of which demonstrated striking similarities to AN, including severe emotional distress and depressive symptoms, self-harm, social withdrawal, and repetitive, obsessive/perfectionistic and ritualistic behaviours relating to food and eating. These behaviours are also often linked to serotonin depletion (Lucki, 1998), which may be expected considering an estimated 95% of serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract (Kim & Camilleri, 2000), and the restriction of food consumption alters the integrity of this organ system. A small number of more recent studies have also shed light onto the cognitive effects of short-term fasting in healthy individuals, including deficits in cognitive flexibility (Piech, Hampshire, Owen, & Parkinson, 2009) and attentional biases to food stimuli (Placanica, Faunce, & Soames Job, 2002); behaviours often characteristic of AN. Changes in cognition, such as deficits in short-term memory, have also been reported in groups who experience rapid weight loss such as athletes in preparation for competition (Choma, Sforzo, & Keller, 1998). Relatedly, the effects of long-term fasting and starvation are likely to significantly alter cognitive functioning in AN. Therefore, the persistence of cognitive alterations and associated behaviours may play a role in habit learning that support the maintenance of the illness. Despite the similarities between starvation effects and AN symptomatology, starvation-related findings are often overlooked in the literature and these characteristics are frequently attributed as trait features of AN as they often continue to recovery. It is, however, unclear whether the consequences of starvation might also be a consequence of AN. To allow the field of AN to move forward, we need to focus our attention on disentangling the effects of the illness from that of starvation. Early human starvation studies provide a basis for this. Investigating gut-brain interactions in AN will also provide further insight into the illness, and is an emerging area of interest in the field. A greater number of rigorous and systematic retrospective and family-based studies are also required to shed light onto features of AN prior to illness onset, and consequently, identify whether they are present irrespective of starvation. Thorough investigations in atypical AN are also essential. Individuals with atypical AN meet all criteria for AN, but despite significant weight loss, are not underweight. Rigorous psychological, biological, and neurobiological investigations comparing typical with atypical AN patients are critical for unravelling the effects of starvation in this illness. Furthermore, greater research into at-risk groups and individuals in the early phases of illness (with presumably only short-term starvation) is essential to enhance our understanding of the disorder. The identification of reliable and valid biomarkers for AN is critical for this purpose, but are not yet available for AN (Phillipou, Rossell, Castle, Gurvich, & Abel, 2014). Biomarker identification is an essential area of research that needs to be pursued in AN. Distinguishing AN from the effects of starvation is essential to our understanding of the illness and will ultimately lead to the development of more effective treatments. Until we are able to differentiate between AN and starvation, we cannot be confident in almost all research findings in this illness.

To make the diagnosis there must be abnormalities in either or both attention and activity which are excessive compared with the norm for a child of that age or developmental level, have been present from an early age (at least seven years but often identifiable by three years) and are pervasive, ie present in more than one area of a child's life (home, school, social situations etc). Medically the status of this diagnos is is that of a syndrome or disorder, not a disease, and none of the described behaviours is exclusive to the diagnosis. It also presents as a spectrum disorder, with less and more severe degrees, but it should be noted that the DSM IV classification requires evidence of clinically significant impairment of function.

      "abstract": "Although patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and peptic ulcer disease present similar symptoms, the two diseases are pathophysiologically completely different and should be treated accordingly. The diagnosis of NUD is still based on negative criteria, i.e., organic diseases must be excluded. The majority of the patients with NUD have a functional disorder possibly as a consequence of psychological stress which, by activating processes within the central nervous system, may evoke a sequence of reactions; By suppressing the vagal tone, fundic adaptation to ingested food may be impaired and the gastric antrum abnormally filled. The latter may contribute to largely unrecognized cause of epigastric discomfort. Increased responsiveness or hypersensitivity to visceral (gastric distention) and psychological (mental stress) stimuli may constitute important factors contributing to perception of discomfort, possibly as abnormal perception of normal events. The treatment of such a complex condition is difficult and may not be solved by medical intervention solely. Patients presenting with dyspepsia of unknown origin, should primarily be treated with antacids. Treatment with prokinetics (cisapride) is rational and worth trying. Antacids and H2-receptor antagonists may help in NUD patients with acid reflux. In patients with Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis Al-Mg-antacids suppress, but alone do not eradicate the bacteria. Antacids in combination with oxytetracycline and metronidazole eradicate H. pylori in about one half of the infected patients.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of digestive functional disease by the statistics of continuous monitoring of esophageal acidity",
      "abstract": "Technological advances in the last few decennia allow the monitoring of many physiological observables in a continuous way, which in physics is called a \"time series\". The best studied physiological time series is that of the heart rhythm, which can be derived from an electrocardiogram (ECG). Studies have shown that a healthy heart is characterized by a complex time series and high heart rate variability (HRV). In adverse conditions, the cardiac time series degenerates towards randomness (as seen in, e.g., fibrillation) or rigidity (as seen in, e.g., ageing), both corresponding to a loss of HRV as described by, e.g., Golberger et. al [1]. Cardiac and digestive rhythms are regulated by the autonomous nervous system (ANS), that consists of two antagonistic branches, the orthosympathetic branch (ONS) that accelerates the cardiac rhythm but decelerates the digestive system, and the parasympathetic brand (PNS) that works in the opposite way. Because of this reason, one might expect that the statistics of gastro-esophageal time series, as described by Gardner et. al. [2,3], reflects the health state of the digestive system in a similar way as HRV in the cardiac case, described by Minocha et. al. In the present project, we apply statistical methods derived from HRV analysis to time series of esophageal acidity (24h pHmetry). The study is realized on data from a large patient population from the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán. Our focus is on patients with functional disease (symptoms but no anatomical damage). We find that traditional statistical approaches (e.g. Fourier spectral analysis) are unable to distinguish between different degenerations of the digestive system, such as gastric esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID).",

      "title": "Psychosomatic factors in gastrointestinal disorders.",
      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal functions such as food intake, propulsive peristalsis, inhibition of reflux, secretion, digestion and defecation are controlled by a complex autonomous neurohumoral system, which is influenced by higher cortical impulses. Life stress may modulate these impulses and in this way cause two types of gastrointestinal reactions. Psychophysiological reactions involve accentuations, inhibition or distortion of the pattern of function of gastrointestinal organs without changes in their structure. Examples of this type of reaction are often painful accentuation of bowel movements in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, and increased gastric secretion elicited by emotional stress. Psychosomatic reactions lead to morphological changes in the end organ, e.g. activation of peptic ulcer or ulcerative colitis. Psychophysiological reactions may be important in the onset of symptoms in some functional diseases, e.g. in the irritable bowel syndrome. These patients need support from the physician, but specific psychiatric therapy is required only in cases with severe psychopathology, e.g. in patients with anorexia nervosa. The role of psychosomatic reactions in the development of organic gastrointestinal diseases is still unclear, as is the value of specific psychiatric therapy in the treatment of diseases such as peptic ulcer or ulcerative colitis. If this kind of therapy has some effect, it may be directed mainly towards subjective symptoms.",

It is divided into three subtypes: infrequent episodic TTH (&lt; 1 headache day per month), frequent episodic TTH (1–14 headache days per month), and chronic TTH (≥ 15 headache days per month). This division is highly relevant for three reasons. Firstly, impact on quality of life differs considerably between the three subtypes. Secondly, the pathophysiological mechanisms also differ. Peripheral mechanisms such as muscle tension are more important in episodic TTH, whereas central pain sensitization with reduced antinociceptive mechanisms are pivotal in chronic TTH. Thirdly, treatment differs between the subtypes, with symptomatic and prophylactic treatment being more appropriate for episodic and chronic TTH, respectively. Non-pharmacological management should always be part of the treatment. Patients with episodic TTH are treated with analgesics, while prophylactic drugs (in particular antidepressants) should be considered in patients with very frequent episodic or chronic TTH.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive. The preoccupation is associated with many time consuming rituals such as mirror gazing or constant comparing. BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised. There is evidence for the benefit of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in high doses for at least 12 weeks, as in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no evidence of any benefit of antipsychotic drugs or other forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Patients in a vegetative state seem to be awake with their eyes open but show no evidence of awareness.1 They do not interact with others and make no purposeful or voluntary responses to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli. They are able to breathe spontaneously, and they retain their gag, cough, sucking, and swallowing reflexes. Sleep-wake cycles are preserved, and so are the hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic responses. They are incontinent of urine and faeces, but they may retain their cranial nerve, spinal, and primitive reflexes. Inconsistent non-purposive movements occur, notably facial grimacing and chewing; they make sounds; and they may show inconsistent auditory and oculomotor orienting reflexes to peripheral sounds or movement. The diagnosis of a vegetative state is not tenable if there is any degree of voluntary movement, sustained visual pursuit, consistent and reproducible visual fixation, or response to threatening gestures.2 3\n\nThe condition is distinct from coma, in which patients have their eyes closed and lack sleep-wake cycles, and from the “locked-in” syndrome, in which patients are aware of themselves and their environment but have lost motor function and speech, communication being achieved by eye movement or blinks. Akinetic mutism is a rare syndrome in which movement is pathologically slowed or nearly absent and speech is lost but wakefulness and self awareness are variably preserved—though the …",

      "title": "Theoretical Accounts of Gulf War Syndrome: From Environmental Toxins to Psychoneuroimmunology and Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Non‐specific illness includes a wide variety of symptoms: behavioural (e.g., reduced food and water intake), cognitive (e.g., memory and concentration problems) and physiological (e.g., fever). This paper reviews evidence suggesting that such symptoms can be explained more parsimoniously as a single symptom cluster than as a set of separate illnesses such as Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This superordinate syndrome could have its biological basis in the activity of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (in particular interleukin‐1: IL‐1), that give rise to what has become known as the ‘sickness response’. It is further argued that the persistence of non‐specific illness in chronic conditions like GWS may be (in part) attributable to a bio‐associative mechanism (Ferguson and Cassaday, 1999). In the case of GWS, physiological challenges could have produced a non‐specific sickness response that became associated with smells (e.g., petrol), coincidentally experienced in the Persian Gulf. On returning to the home environment, these same smells would act as associative triggers for the maintenance of (conditioned) sickness responses. Such associative mechanisms could be mediated through the hypothalamus and limbic system via vagal nerve innervation and would provide an explanation for the persistence of a set of symptoms (e.g., fever) that should normally be short lived and self‐limiting. We also present evidence that the pattern of symptoms produced by the pro‐inflammatory cytokines reflects a shift in immune system functioning towards a (T‐helper‐1) Th1 profile. This position contrasts with other immunological accounts of GWS that suggest that the immune system demonstrates a shift to a Th2 (allergy) profile. Evidence pertaining to these two contrasting positions is reviewed.",

      "title": "Obesity and sleep disturbances: Meaningful sub-typing of obesity",
      "abstract": "Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and self-reported short sleep duration appear to be on the rise, while there is evidence that obesity and these sleep disorders are strongly connected. In this paper, we review data that challenge the common belief that the sleep apnoea and sleep loss, frequently associated with obesity, are the primary determinants of obesity-related objective daytime sleepiness and subjective fatigue (tiredness without increased sleep propensity). Specifically, obesity is associated with objective and subjective EDS regardless of the presence of sleep apnoea. The association between obesity and EDS was confirmed in recent studies of large random samples of the general population or clinical samples, which showed that the primary determinants of subjective EDS were depression, metabolic disturbances, i.e. obesity/diabetes and insulin resistance, and lack of physical activity, and, secondarily, sleep apnoea or sleep loss. Paradoxically, within the obese, with or without sleep apnoea, those who slept objectively better at night are sleepier (objectively) during the day than those who slept worse. The distinguishing factor between those that slept better vs. those that slept worse appears to be level of emotional stress. Furthermore, many studies reported that obesity is associated with self-reported short sleep duration; however, it appears that short sleep duration is a marker of emotional stress rather than a reflection of true sleep loss. Based on these data, we propose that obesity-related deeper sleep and objective EDS are primarily related to metabolic disturbances, whereas obesity-related poorer sleep and subjective fatigue appear to be the result of psychological distress. Furthermore, based on data from studies in normal controls and patients with sleep disorders, it appears that the interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the level of sleep/arousal within the 24-hour cycle, i.e. \"eucortisolemia\" or \"hypocortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with high sleep efficiency and objective sleepiness, whereas \"hypercortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with low sleep efficiency and fatigue. In conclusion, we propose that the above-reviewed data provide the basis for a meaningful phenotypic and pathophysiologic sub-typing of obesity. One subtype is associated with emotional distress, poor sleep, fatigue, HPA axis \"hyperactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia while the other is associated with non-distress, better sleep but more sleepiness, HPA axis \"normo or hypoactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia. This proposed sub-typing may lead to novel, preventive and therapeutic strategies for obesity and its associated sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Ultra-Rapid and Ultradian Cycling in Bipolar Affective Illness",
      "abstract": "Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is defined as four or more affective episodes yearly. The conventionally recognised limit in episode duration is usually considered 24 hours (i.e. a cycle duration of 48 hours). We report a small series of intensively observed bipolar patients who showed much faster patterns of mood oscillation.Detailed, systematic, longitudinal assessment of five bipolar patients during extended in-patient psychiatric evaluation were conducted, including retrospective life charting and prospective evaluation of daily mood by self and blinded observer ratings, and motor activity recording.Our data demonstrate a spectrum of cycling frequencies in rapid-cyclers, including distinct, clinically robust mood shifts that occur at frequencies faster than once per 24 hours. Affective oscillations spanned a range of cycling frequencies from four episodes per year (rapid cycling) to those occurring within the course of weeks to several days (ultra-rapid cycling), to distinct, abrupt mood shifts of less than 24 hours duration (ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian cycling). The time of onset and duration of these ultradian affective fluctuations are highly variable and they are observed in bipolar patients without evidence of personality disorder.The potential clinical and theoretical implications of these first systematic observations of ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling in the context of the evolution of otherwise classical bipolar affective illness are discussed.",

Involuntary sound perception originating in the head Tinnitus can be caused by: Hearing loss Exposure to loud sounds Extreme stress or trauma Acoustic neuroma Injury to ears, neck or head and heart disease Neurophysiological models indicate the mechanism of tinnitus in an increase in spontaneous activity in the absence of acoustic stimuli. General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

      "title": "How to Reduce Distress and Repetitive Behaviors in Patients with OCD: Strategies Help Increase the Effectiveness of CBT for Obsessions and Compulsions",
      "abstract": "Exposure and response (or ritual) prevention has been shown to be effective in improving the therapeutic outlook for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet barriers--including patient unwillingness to enter into the intensive therapy--prevent more persons with OCD from achieving an improved quality of life. This article focuses on the clinical picture of OCD and the multifaceted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that has received the most empirical support. We also describe initiatives to make CBT more accessible to OCD patients, such as providing twice-weekly instead of daily treatment sessions. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] OCD definition: Anxiety/distress OCD is a relatively common, debilitating condition that often develops early in life (Box 1, page 20). (1), (2) The obsessions of this disorder are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems. The compulsions are excessive or unreasonable and serve to reduce the discomfort associated with the obsessions. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the gold standard tool for quantifying OCD (Box 2, page 20). (3), (4) Box 1 OCD: A common, debilitating condition The lifetime prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is 2% to 3%--approximately 2 to 3 times higher than that of schizophrenia. Onset of OCD often is in childhood or adolescence. OCD presents earlier in boys than girls, but by young adulthood the incidence is equally distributed in men and women. (1) Its course typically is chronic and is associated with substantial suffering and functional impairment. According to DSM-IV-TR criteria, OCD is characterized by: * obsessions--persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive, inappropriate, and distressing that an individual attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize with other thoughts or actions * compulsions--repetitive behaviors or mental acts that are aimed at reducing distress or preventing a dreaded consequence. (2) Box 2 Assessing obsessive-compulsive disorder: Y-BOCS The 10-item, clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale (Y-BOCS) (3), (4) has excellent psychometric properties. It is widely used in outcome studies and clinical practice to assess and monitor change and progress. Y-BOCS consists of 5 questions about obsessions and 5 about compulsions; each symptom is rated on a scale of 0 (least severe) to 4 (most severe). Results are combined for a total score of 0 to 40, which is interpreted as: * 0 to 7=subclinical * 8 to 15=mild * 16 to 23=moderate * 24 to 31=severe * 32 to 40=extreme. Obsessions VS compulsions. When diagnosing and treating OCD, it is important to ascertain the functional relationship between a patient's obsessions and compulsions and anxiety/distress: * Obsessions give rise to anxiety/distress. * Compulsions aim to reduce this anxiety/distress. This distinction is important because lay people routinely use the word obsessing to describe being consumed by an idea or an activity. This not the same as the obsession of OCD. Similarly, repetitive behaviors often described as are not necessarily a symptom of OCD. Compulsive eating or gambling can be self-stimulating or positively reinforcing (mostly ego-syntonic). The compulsive behavior of OCD is often viewed by the individual as inappropriate or incompatible with the perception of self (mostly ego-dystonic). OCD's clinical picture Classic vs nonclassic obsessions. Frequently reported obsessions in OCD include fears related to: * contamination (dirt, germs, bodily waste, chemicals) * making mistakes (locks, appliances, paperwork, decisions) * having unwanted impulses (violent, sexual, religious, embarrassing) * orderliness (neatness, symmetry, numbers). …",

Using the case of Mr E, an older, moderate to heavy drinker experiencing memory difficulty, the diagnostic considerations, which include mild cognitive impairment, early Alzheimer dementia, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and \"alcoholic dementia,\" are discussed. These disorders are not mutually exclusive, and in a patient with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia, the contributory role of alcohol can be difficult to determine. In fact, epidemiological studies suggest that mild to moderate intake of alcohol actually reduces the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer dementia. Appropriate management includes measures to reduce alcohol dependence (eg, behavioral or pharmacological therapy) and to delay progression of the cognitive impairment (eg, engaging in healthy behaviors such as cognitive leisure activities).",

      "title": "Status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. SE is defined as a continuous seizure lasting more than 30 min, or two or more seizures without full recovery of consciousness between any of them. Based on recent understanding of the pathophysiology, it is now considered that any seizure that lasts more than 5 min probably needs to be treated as SE. GABAergic mechanisms play a crucial role in terminating seizures. When the seizure persists, GABA-mediated mechanisms become ineffective and several other putative mechanisms of seizure suppression have been recognized. Early treatment of SE with benzodiazepines, followed if necessary by fosphenytoin administration, is the most widely followed strategy. About a third of patients with SE may have persistent seizures refractory to the first-line medications. They require aggressive management with second-line medications such as barbiturates, propofol, or other agents. In developing countries where facilities for assisted ventilation are not readily available, it may be helpful to use nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (such as sodium valproate, levetiracetam, or topiramate) at this stage. It is important to recognize SE and institute treatment as early as possible in order to avoid a refractory state. It is equally important to attend to the general condition of the patient and to ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable. This article reviews current knowledge regarding the management of convulsive SE in adults.",

      "abstract": "Oral food challenges still remain the gold standard in the diagnosis of food related symptoms and are performed to obtain a clear “yes or no” response. However, this is often difficult to achieve, and so proposals may be appropriate for criteria on when to stop oral food challenges and declare a challenge as positive or negative. In daily practice it makes sense to challenge until clear objective symptoms occur without harming the patient. Clinical symptoms should be objective and/or: (a) severe or (b) reproducible or (c) persisting. A sensitive parameter for a beginning clinical reaction is a general change of mood. The sooner symptoms appear, the more likely they are to represent a “true” positive reaction, and the more organ systems are involved the easier it is to assess an oral food challenge as positive. In the case of subjective symptoms, the number of placebo doses should be increased. In unclear situations, the observation time until the next dose should be prolonged or the same dose repeated. Transient objective clinical symptoms usually end up in a positive challenge result. There are a number of causes for false positive and false negative challenge results, which should be considered. The aim of all oral challenge testing should be to hold the balance between two conflicting aspects: on the one hand the need to achieve clear and justified results from oral food challenges in order to avoid unnecessary diets, and on the other hand to protect patients from any harm caused by high doses of a potentially dangerous food.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a disorder that is characterized by excessive preoccupation with body weight and shape, and conscious attempts to stay in low weight due to fear of weight gain. Vomiting, one of the METHODS used by anorexia nervosa patients to stay in low weight, is one of the most important causes of hypokalemia. Diuretics and diarrhea are other common causes of hypokalemia. If hypokalemia is chronic and resistant to treatment, eating disorders and other metabolic conditions should be investigated. One of the rare causes of hypokalemia, an electrolyte imbalance that can cause fatal outcomes, is Gitelman syndrome. Gitelman Syndrome is a genetically inherited disease of the distal tubules which causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and vomiting. It is a syndrome usually diagnosed during adolescence, however it sometimes remains asymptomatic throughout life. Severe symptoms such as tetanus, rhabdomyolysis, and paralysis can also be seen. A case of Gitelman syndrome which was diagnosed as anorexia nervosa due to physical appearance of the patient, low body mass index (BMI), and frequent vomiting and in which the other medical pathologies have not been adequately investigated is presented in this article. Assessments to exclude the medical conditions that may be associated with symptoms are necessary before a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder is made.",

      "title": "SS01-04 - Clinical Experience With Agomelatine In Depressed Patients",
      "abstract": "Agomelatine, the first melatonergic antidepressant, has been widely recognized as a true innovation since its launch in Europe one year ago. Agomelatine has a unique pharmacological profile: an agonist at MT 1 /MT 2 melatonergic receptors and antagonist at 5-HT 2C receptors, it resynchronizes altered circadian rhythms in depression. Agomelatine has already become a first-line treatment option for patients with a first depressive episode, as well as those with recurrent depression. In daily practice, agomelatine can be used in all depressed patients, and is particularly indicated in patients complaining of sleep difficulties. Agomelatine ensures unimpaired daytime vigilance, cognition, gastrointestinal transit, and sexual functioning. Feedback to date from both inpatients and outpatients with major depression is positive: beyond the antidepressant effect, patients frequently report improvement in sleep-wake rhythms and daily functioning, as early as by the first week (mostly within the first 3 days), which differentiates agomelatine from other antidepressants. Most patients report improvement in mood and other symptoms after 2/3 weeks and satisfactory tolerability. The most frequently noted side effects are dizziness, headache, and nausea; liver function tests at initiation of treatment are not considered to be an issue. Because agomelatine, unlike conventional antidepressants, does not affect serotonin levels, in case of switch the initial antidepressant should be progressively downtitrated to avoid discontinuation symptoms, which risk masking the benefits of agomelatine. In summary, the early effects of agomelatine shown in controlled studies are also experienced by the majority of patients in daily practice and reflect its ability to resynchronize circadian rhythms.",

      "title": "Neurotensin and Alcohol Use Disorders: Towards a Pharmacological Treatment",
      "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use is responsible for a group of disorders collectively named alcohol use disorders (AUDs), according to the DSM-5 classification. The damage induced by alcohol depends on the amount, time, and consumption patterns (continuous and heavy episodic drinking). It affects individual global well-being and social and familial environments with variable impact. Alcohol addiction manifests with different degrees of organ and mental health detriment for the individual, exhibiting two main traits: compulsive drinking and negative emotional states occurring at withdrawal, frequently causing relapse episodes. Numerous individual and living conditions, including the concomitant use of other psychoactive substances, lie in the complexity of AUD. Ethanol and its metabolites directly impact the tissues and may cause local damage or alter the homeostasis of brain neurotransmission, immunity scaffolding, or cell repair biochemical pathways. Brain modulator and neurotransmitter-assembled neurocircuitries govern reward, reinforcement, social interaction, and consumption of alcohol behaviors in an intertwined manner. Experimental evidence supports the participation of neurotensin (NT) in preclinical models of alcohol addiction. For example, NT neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala projecting to the parabrachial nucleus strengthen alcohol consumption and preference. In addition, the levels of NT in the frontal cortex were found to be lower in rats bred to prefer alcohol to water in a free alcohol–water choice compared to wild-type animals. NT receptors 1 and 2 seem to be involved in alcohol consumption and alcohol effects in several models of knockout mice. This review aims to present an updated picture of the role of NT systems in alcohol addiction and the possible use of nonpeptide ligands modulating the activity of the NT system, applied to experimental animal models of harmful drinking behavior mimicking alcohol addiction leading to health ruin in humans.",

      "abstract": "Reye’s syndrome is defined as a fatal biphasic disorder that clinically described by preceding viral illness, protracted vomiting from one to two days before the onset of encephalopathy and liver dysfunction. Reye’s syndrome can be characterized as a constellation of delirium, fever, convulsions, vomiting, respiratory collapses, stupor, seizures, or coma typically following an earlier viral illness. Encephalopathy can be frequently progresses rapidly from lethargy to coma within twenty four to forty eight hrs. Both universal mitochondrial injury and triglyceride accumulations are the cornerstone etiology of Reye’s syndrome. Accumulation of high concentration of ammonia leads to encephalopathy and anicteric hepatitis with three times rise in liver enzymes. A frequent pathophysiological mechanism of Reye’s syndrome is induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition. The syndrome is correlated with a high mortality rate and the treatment is symptomatic including intensive care management with correction of metabolic abnormalities especially of hypotension, hypo glycaemia and acidosis, control of convulsions, and monitoring of intracranial hypertension due to cerebral edema. Agents to decrease serum ammonia concentrations are also usually used, the most frequent being are neomycin sulfate or lactulose. Anti-emetic such as ondansetron should be given to inhibit vomiting and potential aspiration.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy is one of the most frequent terminal episodes of primary liver disease. It was already known at the time of Hippocrates, and it was well described by Johanne Baptista Margagni, teacher at the Padua Medical School, in the 18th century. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in the pres­ ence of hepatic functional impairment secondary to acute liver failure or chronic parenchymal liver disease with or without spontaneous or surgi­ cally induced portalsystemic shunting of portal blood. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of liver failure are varied and range from subtle alterations, including mild personality change and disturbance in sleep rhythm, to confusion, drowsiness, stupor, and finally deep coma. In acute liver failure the progression of events may be extremely rapid, taking place in only a few hours. In chronic encephalopathy, in contrast, consciousness may be slowly altered over months, and may occasionally present as progressive and irre­ versible neurological symptomatology with dementia, parkinsonism, or other extrapyramidal signs suggesting involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia (170). Most often in the chronic situation, however, episodes of mental impairment are episodic, the result of defined stresses, and recov­ ery to the premorbid state is the rule. Other symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are not specific for liver disease. Asterixis (flapping tremor of the extremities) is probably the most characteristic neurological sign of hepatic encephalopathy, is more common",

This chapter discusses normal gastric motility to gain a greater appreciation for the abnormalities found in symptomatic patients. A focus has also been on patients with symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying but with normal gastric emptying. There is an overlap of symptoms of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Proximal retention may be seen in gastroesophageal reflux disease, distal retention in functional dyspepsia, and global retention in gastroparesis. Gastroparesis occurs in many clinical settings; the most common are diabetes mellitus, sequelae of gastric surgery, and idiopathic. The chapter addresses abnormalities of gastric motility and sensation in functional dyspepsia. Refractory symptoms lead to a comprehensive evaluation, including gastric emptying scintigraphy and possibly tests of gastric accommodation or compliance.",

Stress contributes to broad variety of diseases including hypertension and superior plasma cortisol, cardiac and CVDs, inflammatory bowel syndromes, type 2 diabetes, and a reduced quality of life among those suffering with cancer. Stress happens in 3 stages. The first stage is an initial stage of alarm, which produces an increase of adrenaline. Living organisms can withstand intense stress and stay alive. Second phase is a brief conflict process that the body puts up to handle the problem. Last phase is the tiredness phase, which arises when the body has utilized every part of its accessible assets. Stress affects the different organs of the whole body. As far as chronic stress is concerned, it stimulates infection in the vasculature, particularly in the coronary arteries, also can alter cholesterol levels and excessive activation of sympathetic nervous system (depletes the system of neurotransmitters, peptides, cofactors, and other mediators). Regarding, endocrine stress, it affects the hypothalamus in brain. The stress condition in n individuals experiencing pressure needs a healthy and regular eating including important supplements, moreover, physical exercise and mind rest are regularly suggested for averting stress induced anxiety-linked objections and disease.",

      "abstract": "Bed rest has been a normal procedure used by physicians for centuries in the treatment of injury and disease. Exposure of patients to prolonged bed rest in the horizontal position induces adaptive deconditioning responses. While deconditioning responses are appropriate for patients or test subjects in the horizontal position, they usually result in adverse physiological responses (fainting, muscular weakness) when the patient assume the upright posture. These deconditioning responses result from reduction in hydrostatic pressure within the cardiovascular system, virtual elimination of longitudinal pressure on the long bones, some decrease in total body metabolism, changes in diet, and perhaps psychological impact from the different environment. Almost every system in the body is affected. An early stimulus is the cephalic shift of fluid from the legs which increases atrial pressure and induces compensatory responses for fluid and electrolyte redistribution. Without countermeasures, deterioration in strength and muscle function occurs within 1 wk while increased calcium loss may continue for months. Research should also focus on drug and carbohydrate metabolism.",

      "abstract": "La restriction alimentaire chronique correspond a un des troubles du comportement alimentaire observe en particulier dans l’anorexie mentale (AN) de type restrictif, pathologie qui touche essentiellement les adolescentes et les jeunes femmes. En plus de ce comportement restrictif, une activite physique importante est observee chez un grand nombre de patientes (40 a 80% des cas). Cette maladie se traduit par de nombreuses alterations physiologiques comme des perturbations neuroendocrines, metaboliques, osseuses (osteopenie, osteoporose) et ce quelle que soit la cause psychiatrique qui a conduit au developpement de ce comportement. De plus, de nombreux arguments suggerent que l’AN pourrait etre consideree comme un trouble « addictif » qui se manifesterait par une addiction a la perte de poids et/ou a la restriction alimentaire ou encore a l’activite physique suggerant une alteration du systeme dopaminergique de recompense. Ainsi, quelles que soient les origines de la maladie, l’AN entraine des perturbations peripheriques et centrales susceptibles d’etre impliquees dans une premiere phase dite « d’adaptation » permettant aux malades de survivre a ces conditions drastiques. Les patients peuvent par la suite tomber dans une seconde phase de « chronicisation » dans laquelle ces memes facteurs pourraient etre responsables de la degradation de l’etat des malades et conduire, dans les cas les plus graves d’epuisement, a la mort.Notre etude a comme pivot la ghreline, hormone orexigene, dont les concentrations plasmatiques sont augmentees significativement chez les patients anorexiques. Secretee principalement en peripherie par les cellules de l’estomac, elle va cibler plusieurs organes aussi bien peripheriques que centraux. En particulier, au niveau peripherique, cette hormone agit au niveau du foie dont la principale fonction connue est le maintien de l’homeostasie glucidique. Elle agit egalement au niveau du tissu adipeux qui est alors stimule, favorisant ainsi sa croissance avec un stockage des reserves et au niveau musculaire en entrainant entre autre une diminution des reserves de triglycerides. Au niveau du systeme nerveux central, parmi les sites d’action de la ghreline, on trouve les structures impliquees aussi bien dans le controle, qualifie d’homeostatique, de la prise alimentaire represente par l’hypothalamus, que dans le controle, dit hedonique (motivation/recompense), de ce meme comportement correspondant au circuit meso-limbique. Pour etudier son implication dans les mecanismes adaptatifs, et eventuellement, dans l’aggravation de la maladie, nous avons mis au point un modele animal de restriction alimentaire chronique mimant les symptomes physiologiques de l’AN. Notre premier objectif a ete de caracteriser (« phenotypage ») ce modele sur le plan physiologique (metabolique, endocrinien) afin de l’utiliser pour notre deuxieme objectif : evaluation du role de la ghreline comme potentiel facteur predictif de l’evolution de la maladie.Les donnees obtenues valident notre modele comme un modele pertinent pour etudier sur le long terme les alterations physiologiques et centrales decrites dans l’AN de type restrictif. Nous montrons que l’exercice physique modere associe a la restriction alimentaire a des effets stabilisateurs sur de nombreux parametres metaboliques limitant ainsi un epuisement premature des ressources energetiques. En ce qui concerne la ghreline, les concentrations plasmatiques elevees observees dans notre modele pourraient contribuer egalement a une regulation adaptative du metabolisme energetique.",

Barang yang dicuri biasanya tidak diperlukan oleh pasien dan bukan untuk dijual. Terdapat beberapa alat bantu untuk penegakkan diagnosis kleptomaniadiantaranya adalah Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Kleptomania (K-YBOCS) dan Kleptomania Symptom Asessment Scale (K-SAS). K-YBOSC merupakan alat ukur keparahan gejala kleptomania. Untuk terapi farmakologi diantaranya Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) merupakan golongan antidepresan yang bekerja dengan meningkatkan level serotonin di otak dan naltrexon merupakan terapi medikasi terhadap adiksi alcohol selain itu beberapa psikoterapi yang banyak dilakukan untuk penderita kleptomania adalah Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), psikoterapi kognitif, desensitisasi sistemik dan terapi aversi. Psikoterapi ini bertujuan untuk mengubah persepsi penderita terhadap tindakan mencuri dan mengalihkan minat ke hal lain.Kata kunci: kleptomania, psikopatologi, adiks",

      "abstract": "The metabolic myopathies are a group of disorders characterized by impaired energy production in muscle that results from inherited defects in glycogen, lipid, or mitochondrial metabolism. Although onset in the neonatal period and during infancy is typical of many of these disorders, others may present for the first time during adolescence of adulthood. The typical presentation in adolescence or adulthood is with either (1) dynamic (i.e., fluctuating) symptoms like myoglobinuria and muscle weakness related to exercise that resolve completely, or (2) static (present all the time) symptoms such as slowly progressive muscle weakness. The gold standard for the diagnosis of these disorders usually relies on biochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen with demonstration of the specific enzymatic defect. Such testing, however, is not part of the routine evaluation of every muscle biopsy, and because biochemical evaluation of muscle requires special preparation of the tissue sample at the time of biopsy, it cannot be requested post hoc. The diagnosis of a metabolic myopathy, therefore, requires a high index of clinical suspicion so that the appropriate testing can be arranged at the time of muscle biopsy. What are the typical presentations of the adult-onset metabolic myopathies? And what is the utility of more readily available investigations such as serum creatine kinase (CK), electromyography (EMG), and the forearm exercise test in ranking the likelihood of the presence or absence of a metabolic myopathy? Questions such as these, relating to the diagnosis of metabolic myopathy, form the bulk of this chapter, although some attention is also paid to the role of therapeutic interventions such as dietary modifications (e.g., lowcarbohydrate or low-fat diets) as well as supplements like creatine and coenzyme Q10.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

Dyspnea is comparable to pain because both caution the organism that will activate protective mechanisms to avoid further damage. Dyspnea results from central nervous processing of respiratory feed back signals. Feed back from respiratory muscles, the chest wall, the airways and the lung reach the brain while partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide is continuously monitored and arterial blood gases are permanently stabilized. Sensation of breathlessness depends on its origin. Main qualities of dyspnea include air hunger during hypercapnia, laboured breathing during increased minute ventilation and chest tightness in asthma. During chronic dyspnea, respiratory control aims for a new breathing pattern that will ease breathlessness. Since respiratory control includes both autonomic regulation and cortical modulation of breathing, voluntarily guided respiration can be employed to influence other autonomic regulated systems and pain perception.",

      "title": "Review article on sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that involves a reduces or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe. It occurs when the muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissue in the back of the throat to collapse and block the upper airway. This results in partial reductions (hypopneas) and complete block (apneas) in breathing that lasts a minimum of 10 seconds during sleep. Most pauses last between 10 and 30 seconds, but some may persist for one minute or longer. This can cause abrupt reductions in blood oxygen saturation. The brain responds to the lack of oxygen by alerting the body, causing a brief arousal from sleep that restores normal breathing. This pattern can occur many times in one night. The result is a fragmented quality of sleep that often produces an excessive level of daytime sleepiness. Most people with OSA snore loudly and regullarly, with periods of silence when airflow is reduced or blocked. They then make choking, snorting or gasping sounds when their airway reopens. A common measurement of sleep apnea is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).",

In addition, they often complain of excessive fatigue during exercise and have a general lack of tolerance for exercise and decreased endurance compared with their peers.

Although the ultimate treatment for these symptoms is to fix the underlying problem of obesity itself and contributors to its development, simply changing behavior can begin to have an impact on levels of fatigue, independent of weight loss.",

      "abstract": "RésuméUne étude comparer entre une série de vingt-quatre qui se sont tailladé le poignet et un groupe de contrôle qui ont voulu s'empoisonner a permis de dépister plusieurs différences significatives. Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

      "abstract": "The topics in this chapter are as follows: Bedwetting (Nocturnal enuresis = NE), Frequent urination, Dysuria and Polyuria. Bedwetting Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate between monosymptomatic and complicated NE, and failing to recognize other causes of nocturnal enuresis, blood in urine, dysuria, and polyuria. Bedwetting presents either in isolation (monosymptomatic enuresis = MSE) or in association with urinary tract infection (UTI), vulvovaginitis, daytime incontinence, urge, hesitancy, straining symptoms of urination, postvoid dribbling or dysfunctional voiding (non-monosymptomatic enuresis = NMSE). NE is divided into primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) (restarting bedwetting after a previous dry period >6 months) in 20% of children. The chapter discusses diagnostic criteria of monosymptomatic NE and differentiating it from other conditions causing nocturnal enuresis including compulsive drinking, type 1 diabetes and diabetes insipidus. Blood in urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate blood from other blood-appearing substances in the urine, failing to recognize pathologies causing blood in urine in neonates, and in older children. When a child presents with blood in urine, doctors should determine that it is actually haematuria? Red staining of the nappy can be due to either true blood with RBCs or urates. Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn should be excluded. Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon in premature babies and it can be seen in up to 40 days of life. The detection of proteinuria in association with haematuria is very suggestive of renal origin of the haematuria such as glomerulonephritis. Pathologies causing haematuria in older children include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is the most common cause of gross haematuria worldwide. Other topics discussed include urinary tract infection; renal stones, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, renal tumour. Nephroblastoma is the most common urological malignancy in children. Schistosomiasis occurs in many countries, e.g. Egypt. Frequent urination Misdiagnosis is due to failing to establish characteristics of frequent urination and differentiating it from continuous urination and polyuria. The term indicates frequent urination more than 7–8 times a day in older children, The condition needs to be differentiated from continuous dribbling due to posterior urethral valve obstruction in boys, and ectopic ureter in girls. Diagnostic criteria of both conditions are discussed. Dysuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to recognize that dysuria can exist in infancy, failing to establish common underlying causes of painful urination Dysuria in infancy: Painful urination may occur due to urethritis caused by infection, as idiopathic urethritis, hypercalciuria, or part of Reiter's syndrome (associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis), or due to nappy dermatitis affecting the foreskin of the penis. Underlying causes of dysuria in older children are discussed. Urinary incontinence Misdiagnosis is due to failing to consider basic knowledge on urinary incontinence, and failing to establish important secondary causes of urinary incontinence. Basic knowledge of urinary incontinence and their underlying causes of urinary are discussed. Labial fusion is another cause and is common affecting about 3% of pre-pubertal girls Polyuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to define the diagnosis of polyuria, to differentiate the main causes of polyuria, including diabetes, compulsive drinking, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis and hypercalcaemia. Polyuria in children results from either a water or solute diuresis. Polydipsia indicates excessive water intake, which is defined in this section. Diagnostic criteria of diabetes type 1 and diabetes insipidus (DI) are discussed. The most important differential diagnosis is between compulsive drinking and DI. Diagnostic criteria of compulsive drinking and renal tubular acidosis are provided. Urinary Retention/inability to pass urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to distinguish oliguria and anuria from urine retention, and not differentiating the main causes of urine retention. Urine retention indicates an inability to empty the bladder for >12 h with a normal or increased urine volume, or a palpable distended bladder. Causes include bladder neck or urethral obstruction. Oliguria in infants is a urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/h per 24 h. In older children and adults oliguria is <400/day. This quantity (usually resulting from dehydration in children) is insufficient to excrete the daily osmolar load. Causes of reduced urine output or retention in neonates and in older children are discussed.",

The prevalence of eating disorders has ranged from 8% in the world and 9% in the U.S. (10 million females, 1 million males) to a higher rate of 28% in outpatient psychiatric clinics. The various types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, atypical anorexia nervosa, other specified feeding and eating disorders and orthorexia. The reported negative effects include self-criticism and low self-compassion, injuries and medical complications. The positive effects include low pain and posttraumatic growth. Comorbidities include gastrointestinal problems, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Predictors/risk factors include childhood trauma, excessive social media, neuroticism, perfectionism, self-criticism, body dissatisfaction, fears of weight gain and multiple pre-existing conditions. Buffers and interventions include body appreciation, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), internet CBT, alternative therapies including art, music and movement therapies and psychedelics. Potential underlying biological mechanisms involve adrenergic activity, inflammation, orexins, tryptophan and serotonin depletion and reduced connectivity in different regions of the brain. Methodological limitations of this literature include the predominance of reviews and meta-analyses versus empirical studies, the combining of the various types of eating disorders in metaanalyses, and the rare multivariate studies to determine the relative significance of risk factors as well as effectiveness of different therapies.",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

Patients with TEA often complain of autobiographical amnesia for recent and remote events, but show normal anterograde memory.To investigate (a) accelerated long term forgetting and (b) autobiographical memory in a group of patients with TEA.Seven patients with TEA and seven age matched controls were evaluated on a range of anterograde memory tasks in two sessions separated by 6 weeks and by the Galton-Crovitz test of cued autobiographical memory.Patients with TEA showed abnormal long term forgetting of verbal material, with virtually no recall after 6 weeks. In addition, there was impaired recall of autobiographical memories from the time periods 1985-89 and 1990-94 but not from 1995-1999.TEA is associated with accelerated loss of new information and impaired remote autobiographical memory. There are a number of possible explanations including ongoing subclinical ictal activity, medial temporal lobe damage as a result of seizure, or subtle ischaemic pathology. Future analyses should seek to clarify the relationship between aetiology, seizure frequency, and degree of memory impairment.",

The present article combines theoretical and empirical approaches to integrate phenomenological, psychological, and neuroscientific accounts of abnormal time perception in BP. Phenomenology distinguishes between perception of inner time, ie, self-time, and outer time, ie, world-time, that desynchronize or dissociate from each other in BP: inner time speed is abnormally slow (as in depression) or fast (as in mania) and, by taking on the role as default-mode function, impacts and modulates the perception of outer time speed in an opposite way, ie, as too fast in depression and too slow in mania. Complementing, psychological investigation show opposite results in time perception, ie, time estimation and reproduction, in manic and depressed BP. Neuronally, time speed can be indexed by neuronal variability, ie, SD. Our own empirical data show opposite changes in manic and depressed BP (and major depressive disorder [MDD]) with abnormal SD balance, ie, SD ratio, between somatomotor and sensory networks that can be associated with inner and outer time. Taken together, our combined theoretical-empirical approach demonstrates that desynchronization or dissociation between inner and outer time in BP can be traced to opposite neuronal variability patterns in somatomotor and sensory networks. This opens the door for individualized therapeutic \"normalization\" of neuronal variability pattern in somatomotor and sensory networks by stimulation with TMS and/or tDCS.",

An acute stress reaction occurs as a natural phenomenon. It is a consequence of prolonged experiences that are difficult to ignore. A person is in constant anxiety: he is scared, he feels heavy, he cannot concentrate, sleep normally. His entire body is in constant tension. This condition does not go away for weeks and results in a number of symptoms. The characteristics of stress directly depend on the personality, habits, and close environment. The stronger it is, the fewer negative processes occur in its life. A person has a simple reaction to stress only in cases where he has high stress resistance. He knows how to distance himself from difficulties, overcome difficulties without harming himself. Emergency response methods are abnormal reactions caused by constant internal tension. A person does not rest, does not discharge, does not calm down: internal organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems suffer due to constant stress. Acute reactions are the result of neglecting psychological problems that are a consequence of unfavorable environmental factors.

This paradoxical phenomenon, that sleeplessness ameliorates depressive symptomatology and that depression usually returns after the next night of sleep or even after short naps, raises the question, if in depressed patients, sleep may have a depressiogenic influence? N a p studies conducted up to now draw an inconsistent picture. G i l l i n et a l . (2) and Giedke (3) did not f ind detrimental effects of naps on mood, either during the morning or the afternoon, in successfully sleep deprived depressed patients. However , in one study (2), only very brief naps were allowed (< 10 minutes), whereas the patients in the other study (3) were not free of psychoactive medication. A study by our group (4) showed that naps at 1300 h reestablished depressive symptomatology in approximately half of the patients, particularly when the nap included R E M sleep. This effect was, however, confounded with a longer sleep length in the patients wi th R E M n a p s . The present investigation aimed at evaluating the questions: (a) whether morning naps are capable of reinducing depression in sleep deprived depressed patients, (b) if a relapse is related to the occurrence of R E M sleep during these naps, when controll ing for sleep length?",

      "title": "Unsupervised mobility and motion assessment in neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders using mobile health technology",
      "abstract": "Mobility deficits are not uncommon in persons with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders. This can have a negative impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, quality of life and activities of daily living (1). Conventionally, mobility and physical activity have been measured in a clinical and laboratory setting by a qualified health professional and is thus called supervised assessment (1). It is either a qualitative or quantitative one- time snapshot evaluation of physical activity, mobility or motion and is highly influenced by factors such as the Hawthorne effect, the time of day when the measurement was taken, white coat and reverse white coat effect (1). Moreover, supervised mobility assessment may have many limitations such as limited ecological validity, lack of patient-centered focus, inability to record real-world challenges, absence of real-time feedback, lack of ability to consider patient's environment, and an omission in observing the range of performance across the day or week (1). To tackle the above mentioned limitations, recently unsupervised mobility assessment of mobility and physical activity using mobile health technology has emerged as an alternative to conventional supervised assessment (1-3). Significant differences may be observed when comparing identical mobility outcomes measured under supervised and unsupervised conditions (1, 3). A systematic review revealed significant variations of 40-180% in identical mobility measures acquired from the same participants across different settings (1). The disparities between supervised and unsupervised measurements are notably greater than the effects observed in treatment interventions. Minor to moderate treatment effects may be overshadowed by these substantial differences in measurement modes (1). Unsupervised assessment holds the potential to address the limitations of supervised assessment as it is patient-centered, ecologically valid, capable of recording fluctuating and rare events, unaffected by the white coat and Hawthorne effects, provides real-time treatment feedback, records real-world challenges, is influenced by a person's mood and fatigue, considers the environment, and reports performance across the day or week (1). Moreover, unsupervised assessment does not require the presence of a trained professional, or the patient to report to a clinic or hospital, and thus can be of great value in rural environments and in tele-medicine/rehabilitation. Not only would this be cost effective, it will also decrease the load on the health care system and the need for health care human resource. ---Continue",

DiscussionAn older definition describes an acute stroke as the first 24 h after symptom onset, a subacute stroke as the phase between day 1 and day 5, and a stroke older than 5 days as chronic [2].Another definition describes an early hyperacute phase (0-6 h), a late hyperacute phase (6-24 h), an acute phase (1-7 days), as subacute phase (1-3 weeks) and a chronic phase (> 3 weeks) [3].If you look through the definition, statements [4, 5] and guidelines [6-8], you won't get any wiser.In order to create clear definitions in these papers, mixed terms such as \"acute stroke < 6 hours\" or \"acute stroke < 4.5 hours\" are often used.The question is also who should set and name these times in the interdisciplinary competition.In our opinion, it's actually quite clear: only the imaging.Due to the individual compensation possibilities for different collaterals and anatomical variants of the patients, one cannot and should not set a fixed time for the stages of the stroke.For example, a recent prospective study found a Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in 52.6% of patients between 4.5 and 10 h after symptom onset [9].This indicates that an active or acute infarction process is ongoing at this time, and under certain circumstances, a thrombectomy might still be considered appropriate.For this reason, the nomenclature of the phase of a stroke should be strictly based on imaging to accelerate interventions and simplify interdisciplinary",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea: diagnosis, epidemiology, and economics.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder characterized by intermittent upper-airway collapse, which impairs ventilation and disrupts sleep. Factors that contribute to upper-airway collapse include reduced upper-airway dilator muscle activity during sleep, specific upper-airway anatomical features, decreased end-expiratory lung volume, ventilatory control instability, sleep-state instability, and rostral fluid shifts in the recumbent position. The relative contributions of these factors vary between individuals with OSA, and this may have implications as to which treatments are efficacious for an individual. OSA is common in adults; males, older individuals, and the obese are at higher risk. There is uncertainty in how to measure severity of sleep-disordered breathing, what cut-off to use to demarcate abnormal, and how to define the clinical syndrome. Identifying patients at higher risk who should have a sleep study is relatively simple, involving assessment of several factors, such as snoring, witnessed apnea/self-reported gasping, hypertension, body mass index, and neck circumference. As would be expected from a disorder that causes morbidity, OSA is associated with substantial economic costs to society, including increased medical costs. A reduction in medical costs in a diverse adult patient population with OSA after therapy has not been convincingly demonstrated. Nevertheless, the results of cost-effectiveness analyses strongly support the cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients with moderate to severe OSA, relative to other standard medical therapies that society is willing to pay for.",

The most frequent cause is stroke, followed by tumor, trauma, anoxia, vascular malformation, or multiple sclerosis. For some causes (and for stroke in particular), AIM can occur immediately after the brain lesion (for example, hemiballism during the acute phase of the stroke (Destée et al., 1990) whereas initial motor deficit may improve or be recovered rapidly. However, in other situations, AIMs (e.g. dystonia) emerge following a long period (a few months or years) of stable motor impairment (Marsden et al., 1985; Scott and Jankovic, 1996). AIMs can also be subdivided into transient (hemiballism, often in the acute phase) and persistent (dystonia, tremor, etc.). Whatever their timescales of appearance or disappearance, AIM may be the main symptom of stroke. This induces a delay in diagnosis or even a lack of knowledge of the specific diagnosis, since for the same underlying cause, the type of AIM can be quite different. This problem is sometimes clinically evident when the AIM is intense (hemiballism) or, in contrast, very moderate and focalized (asterixis). It is clear that a delay in diagnosis may have unhelpful consequences in terms of the patient's clinical and therapeutic management.",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

They yearn for coherence and meaning and, like the Biblical Job, often ask, “Why me?” This statement can reflect anger and depression, and can also represent several different questions: (1) Why am I singled out? (why me vs. someone else); (2) What did I do to cause this, and what if I had acted differently? (3) Is this punishment? and (4) Does this fate reflect some kind of order, rather than mere randomness? Many patients wonder if they somehow deserve bad outcomes, and sometimes feel that they do, related to guilt, anger, and fear, even if recognizing, intellectually, that such emotions are unhelpful. Physical explanations of illness (e.g., genetics) often don’t feel fully satisfying. Psychotherapy can potentially ease but not necessarily eliminate these ponderings, and not everyone can afford it.

      "title": "Living With a Chronic Illness",
      "abstract": "As our country ages (and as we get older), it seems that there are more and more people living with a chronic illness. An effective strategy for thinking about life events would allow the chronically ill patient to focus on his or her disease and its treatment only just prior to a medical appointment. It would be reasonable also for him or her to consider the illness whenever symptoms appear that require interpretation or action. It would be ideal, however, for the patient to “forget about the illness” for the remainder of his/her time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a more usual approach is for the patient to think about the illness on multiple occasions and to spend time asking a number of “what-ifs” related to its course and effects. In addition, whenever there is a distressing symptom, the patient will typically try to attribute the symptom to the chronic illness. This approach can lead to a disrupted life experience in which the illness is the patient’s constant focus. It can interrupt sleep, diminish the pursuit of usual interests, and lead to weight changes, energy changes, and memory loss as well as severely affect mood. Clinical depression can result.\r\n\r\nA critical turning point in adaptation would have the patient focus on his or her role in this process. “It isn’t happening to me, rather I am making it happen,” would illustrate the hoped-for transition. This problem captures the essence of the psychological challenge (alongside the physical challenge) offered by the subject of our case presentation. As is often the case, the patient’s spouse was a partner in the enterprise and benefited from being engaged with him in the solution.",

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play a key role in the well-being of patients, facing a myriad of challenges on a daily basis, ranging from long and irregular working hours, high stress levels, and the need to make timely or critical decisions, often in a high-pressure environment. Although physicians and nurses do their best to provide outstanding care to their patients, they often do not prioritize their own self-care, with resultant negative impacts on their physical and mental health.5 A web-based survey from Ontario demonstrated an increased likelihood of IBS (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.32) for every hour of sleep deprivation among resident doctors, after adjustment for age and gender.6 Similarly, a study from Michigan demonstrated that rotating shift nurses had a significantly higher prevalence of abdominal pain compared with day shift (81% vs. 54%, P < 0.0001) and night shift workers (61%, P = 0.003), implicating disruption of circadian rhythm from shift work, on-call shifts, inadequate sleep quality, and psychological stress in the risk of FGID.7 Adding further perspective to these observations, in this issue of JGH Open, Nagarethinam et al. report a cross-sectional survey assessing the prevalence and associations of FGIDs among HCPs from a tertiary Australian hospital setting.8 Between January 2017 and June 2018, 274 HCPs were surveyed, and data were collected for demographics, medical role, work hours, sleep habits, stress levels (frequency and severity), and dietary factors. Risk factors for FGIDs and their symptoms based on the Rome III criteria were assessed using a self-report questionnaire (FGID-Q), and quality of life (QoL) was assessed for its impact on work, leisure, relationships, and social activities.9 Responses were scored using Likert scales, numerical scales, and open text questions. Participants were considered to have FGID if they met Rome III criteria. Only FD and IBS were specifically examined in this study. The study involved 274 respondents (77% female, median age 35 years) consisting mostly of nurses (66%), followed by doctors (17%) and allied health professionals (10%). Of the respondents, 54% had experienced some GI symptoms three or more times per week, with 46% of these reporting concurrent changes in stool frequency and/or consistency. The three most common GI symptoms experienced were early satiety (42%), non-epigastric/lower abdominal pain (31%), and epigastric pain (22%). FGIDs were identified in 23% of respondents, (2% IBS, 19% FD, and 2% both). Nearly a third (30%) of respondents experienced an adverse impact on their QoL due to GI symptoms. The investigators identified a number of risk factors associated with GI symptoms and FGIDs. The risk factors for GI symptoms included female sex (58% vs. 38%, [OR] 2.3, P = 0.006), Caucasian versus Asian ethnicity (59% vs. 35%, OR 2.7, P = 0.002), high stress levels (67% vs. 40%, OR 3.1, P < 0.001), and irregular working hours (62% vs. 46%, OR 1.9, P = 0.019). Multivariable analysis identified being easily stressed (OR 2.7, P = 0.001) and female sex (OR 2.4, P = 0.037) as predictors of GI symptoms, while Asian ethnicity was protective (OR 0.42, P = 0.027). For FGIDs, higher prevalence was observed in respondents who often felt stressed (27% vs. 10%, OR 3.4, P = 0.013) or felt easily stressed (29% vs. 17%, OR 2.1, P = 0.015), as well as in nurses compared with other HCPs (27% vs. 16%, OR 1.9, P = 0.049). FGID rates were similar between males (23%) and females (23%). Multivariate modeling showed that being often stressed (OR 4.1, P = 0.011), with working as a nurse tending toward significance (OR 2.0, P = 0.057), was associated with FGIDs. Intriguingly, GI symptoms and FGIDs were not found to be associated with age, smoking, alcohol intake, sleep deprivation, or dietary factors (including red meat and fruit/vegetable intake). Nagarethinam and colleagues are to be commended for tackling an under-researched area of great importance. The incisive identification of factors associated with risk of GI and FGIDs, if not entirely surprising, is sobering. The study findings are concerning as FGIDs can negatively impact HCPs' work and personal life, leading to reduced productivity and burnout.10 The high prevalence of FGIDs among HCPs has potentially serious implications for any healthcare system. Firstly, HCPs with FGIDs may experience reduced QOL and work productivity, impacting patient care.10, 11 For instance, they may need to take time off work or be less focused with patients, with potential risk of medical errors and its undesirable or serious consequences. Often hidden in plain sight is resilience among medical professionals, which underpins the moral fabric of professionalism and commitment.12 However, it is entirely plausible that this might delay HCPs from seeking help for assessment of stress or FGIDs and related symptoms. HCPs with FGIDs may consider the perception of stigma and discrimination from colleagues who may not understand the nature and impact of these disorders and in turn act as a deterrent to any referral for assessment.11, 13 Although considered inversely proportional, the boundaries between resilience and burnout are not immutable.12 Compassion satisfaction (the sense of satisfaction, meaning, and joy experienced from caring for people in challenging situations) must consider the delicate balance with fatigue and its consequences as an important determinant for healthcare professionals' QoL and indeed for healthcare itself.14 Future studies should examine resilience and burnout as well as factors associated with identification and referral for such symptoms including HCP roles and characteristics of the practice and external environments. Healthcare systems must address system issues in the clinical care environment, which are needed to reduce burnout and promote physician well-being. One way to address the issue of FGIDs among HCPs could be to promote healthy lifestyles and stress management. Hospitals and healthcare organizations can encourage regular exercise and offer stress management programs such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioral therapy.10 These interventions can improve the physical and mental health of HCPs, leading to reduced levels of stress, improved sleep quality, and increased work productivity and indeed quality of patient care delivered. Creating a supportive work environment that promotes open communication and access to mental health services is crucial. HCPs should be encouraged to seek help if they experience symptoms of FGIDs or other health conditions. Mental health programs, such as employee assistance programs, counseling services, and peer support groups, can provide valuable resources for HCPs and improve their well-being. Additionally, interventions that focus on improving workplace culture, reducing workload, and providing access to counseling and support groups can also contribute to reducing the prevalence of FGIDs among HCPs, ensuring they have the resources needed to effectively perform their roles without experiencing burnout or job dissatisfaction.15 This study by Nagarethinam and colleagues and its sobering observations raise several important questions, challenging our perceptions about HCPs, indeed ourselves. The limitations of the study, while reflecting a paucity of literature, make a compelling case for clinicians to pause and consider our perceptions and paradigms regarding what constitutes HCP well-being and how we address gaps in recognizing and addressing them. We may have only scratched the surface, but as these questions seek better answers, it also fills us with renewed optimism of a better future for those who provide professional expertise and care and for our patients for whom we care.",

      "title": "A Case of Major Depressive Disorder and Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Responding to Escitalopram",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction may be a goal-directed choice driven by excessive drug value in negative affective states, a habit driven by strong stimulus-response associations, or a compulsion driven by insensitivity to costs imposed on drug seeking. Laboratory animal and human evidence for these three theories is evaluated. Excessive goal theory is supported by dependence severity being associated with greater drug choice/economic demand. Drug choice is demonstrably goal-directed (driven by the expected value of the drug) and can be augmented by stress/negative mood induction and withdrawal-effects amplified in those with psychiatric symptoms and drug use coping motives. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms confer risk of dependence, and coping motives mediate this risk. Habit theory of addiction has weaker support. Habitual behaviour seen in drug-exposed animals often does not occur in complex decision scenarios, or where responding is rewarded, so habit is unlikely to explain most human addictive behaviour where these conditions apply. Furthermore, most human studies have not found greater propensity to habitual behaviour in drug users or as a function of dependence severity, and the minority that have can be explained by task disengagement producing impaired explicit contingency knowledge. Compulsion theory of addiction also has weak support. The persistence of punished drug seeking in animals is better explained by greater drug value (evinced by the association with economic demand) than by insensitivity to costs. Furthermore, human studies have provided weak evidence that propensity to discount cost imposed on drug seeking is associated with dependence severity. These data suggest that human addiction is primarily driven by excessive goal-directed drug choice under negative affect, and less by habit or compulsion. Addiction is pathological because negative states powerfully increase expected drug value acutely outweighing abstinence goals.",

      "abstract": "Dysequilibrium disorders such as dizziness, balance and gait changes, and falls are among the most common yet poorly understood medical problems for older persons. A recent analysis of data about people aged 65 and older indicates that dysequilibrium is one of most common diagnoses in short-stay hospitalizations, and it accounts for an average of 4.3 days of medical care. Older people without overt disease of any type tend to perform more poorly on balance tests than do younger people. Gait deficits in many older people are associated with considerable functional impairments. Deficits in postural control are associated with an increased risk of falling. Geriatric dysequilibrium disorders can be caused by one or more factors--vestibular, vascular, visual, neuromuscular, pharmacologic--each of which must be considered to understand and appropriately treat the dysequilibrium. The accurate identification of the cause of dysequilibrium must involve the testing of multiple, interacting systems. The literature suggests that often no clear cause for an older person's dysequilibrium can be found, and indicates the possible existence of presently unappreciated etiologic factors. Progress in understanding these problems probably has been stymied by the fact that only a small, select subgroup of older patients is referred to specialists in otolaryngology. Quite probably, considerable progress on the understanding of the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of geriatric dysequilibria would result from more extensive research collaboration between otorhinolaryngologists, geriatricians, epidemiologists, and other specialists.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "A large number of patients present with symptoms that are related to meal ingestion or that refer to the gastroduodenal region. When conventional diagnostic means do not readily identify an underlying cause, abnormal gastric sensorimotor function is thought to be the pathophysiological mechanism. Disordered gastric motility occurs when the processes of interdigestive motility, gastric reservoir function or gastric emptying are not properly controlled. Conditions associated with disordered gastric motility include functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, dumping syndrome, and (other) postoperative states. Symptoms in these patients include postprandial fullness and bloating, early satiation, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and burning, loss of appetite, and, in more severe cases, weight loss. After exclusion of organic disease, gastric emptying testing is the most frequently used diagnostic procedure, but its role in explaining symptoms and guiding therapy is limited. Besides small dietary adjustments, gastroprokinetic drugs are the treatment of choice for gastroparesis and also functional dyspepsia. In refractory cases, centrally acting agents, such as antidepressants, or hypnotherapy have been advocated, and nutritional support may be required in patients with severe weight loss. The diagnosis of dumping syndrome is based on clinical suspicion and can be aided by a glucose challenge test. Treatment consists of dietary measures, acarbose, and somatostatin analogs in refractory cases.",

      "abstract": "Any change in the social or physical environment that threatens the needs or interests of a mammal, induces a state of tension ('stress') in the animal. Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

      "title": "Constructing 'Control' over Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is often chronic, with one of the highest death rates for psychological conditions. Law can compel treatment, but is rarely invoked, at least formally (though the strategic possibilities of orders confers internal authority within the clinical setting). Instead, 'control' (or management) is exercised diffusely, through disciplinary practices embedded in everyday clinic life, such as daily routines of eating and washing, behavioural 'contracts', regular surveillance and measuring, interactions with staff, visits and activities. The regulatory regime not only touches on such 'practices' but also targets 'identities' (including self-image, and attitudes to the body) and what Goffman called the 'moral career' of the patient (eg learning to play the 'patient role', to 'be' an 'anorexic'). We argue that it is not the clumsiness of the law, or the success of less restrictive options which explains why law is so infrequently engaged. Rather, based on an interpretation of Foucault, we concluded that the regulatory regimes that shape treatment of anorexia nervosa, is 'the law', in a sense. The regime of governmentality within the clinic is shaped by practices which operationalise 'duty of care', or translate medical expertise into medical authority, or show how interactions between 'experts', 'carers' and patients are mediated through conventions and rules, or which conscript 'empowerment' as control. The patient learns to provide consent 'freely', to make the 'correct' choices, to accept the 'empowerment' regime that is made even more convincing by the threat of legal intervention. In time the constraints learned in this way become part of the new role, that of the 'recovering' patient. The 'fiction' of acting 'responsibly', employed so hesitantly at first, becomes part of the new identity. The patient has become an active participant in the governance of self.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

(2012) found that nearly 13% of their younger respondents (under 45) had perimenopausal symptoms which 'severely compromised quality of life', peaking amongst those who were four years post-menopause, with 31.6% reporting the same problem (p.549).Although the gradual decline with aging of hormones, like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, is the basis of natural menopause, some women have sudden onset menopause due to surgery, such as a full hysterectomy, which also removes the ovaries, or medication such as Tamoxifen for breast cancer.Equally -at least if we consult data from the Global Northsymptoms usually start to occur in a woman's mid-to-late 40s, and menopause is reached at 51.Even so, about 1% of women go through early menopause (before the age of 45), or premature menopause (before the age of 40).English language research into menopause in the Brazilian and wider Latin American context, however, suggests some compelling differences as well as some similarities between",

      "abstract": "Comprehensive management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is reviewed, including assessment, counseling, diet, relaxation techniques, exercise, social adaptation, hormonal and medical treatment. Studies of PMS are remarkable for high (40-95%) placebo response, and good results with any treatment, especially in the 1st cycle in uncontrolled studies, but poor performance of therapies in random, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Heterogeneous groups of subjects, small numbers and too few cycles may contribute to these findings. The 1st step in treating PMS is thorough assessment and counseling, with at least a hour of listening to the patient. A healthy, varied diet should be suggested, limiting refined sugars, salt, red meat, diary products, chocolate, caffeine products, tobacco, alcohol, and increasing complex carbohydrates and PUFAs, in several small meals. PMS patients rarely have abnormal glucose tolerance tests, but they often exhibit related symptoms. Relaxation and exercise should be prescribed so as to raise endorphins, lower stress, increase control and provide enjoyment. Starting with non-hormonal medications, 100 mg vitamin B6 daily and 1.5 g evening primrose oil bid are suggested to regulate dopamine, serotonin and prostaglandin metabolism. Depending on symptoms, spironolactone diuretics, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs or anxiolytics may be prescribed. Hormone treatment ranges from progesterone per rectum or vagina, or oral progestins (usually didrogesterone), estradiol sc, implants, orally or transdermally, oral contraceptives, to hormonal antagonists such as bromocriptine, danazol or LH-RH analogues. The theoretical case for hormone treatments is not established, although some women obtain relief from certain treatments.",

Baby blues are characterized by mood lability and sudden crying but most commonly last a few days and then resolve. Up to 70 percent of women experience a few days of baby blues which then resolves completely. Most women with PPD develop symptoms within four weeks of giving birth, though symptoms can occur anytime within the 12 months following delivery. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of women experience PPD following childbirth. Postpartum depression can occur as a result of a live birth, spontaneous abortion, elective termination, or a fetal demise. In the United States 2 million new mothers experience PPD annually. Certain factors reduce the risk of PPD, including adequate social support, regular sleep patterns, and breastfeeding.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists for longer than three months and is associated with significant emotional distress or functional disability and that cannot be explained by another chronic condition. Headache is defined as pain occurring only or mainly above the orbitomeatal and/or nuchal ridge, whereas facial pain is defined as pain occurring mainly or exclusively under the orbitomeatal line, anterior to the pinnae and above the neck. Usually in chronic pain definition implies pain on a daily basis in the case of orofacial pain and headache chronicity is defined as pain occurring on more than 15 days per month and lasting for more than 4 hours daily for at least the last 3 months. This definition excludes the periodic short-lasting pains that often recur in the face and head, but are not essentially chronic. The article discusses about various presentations of the disease and aims to establish definite diagnostic guidelines and first line treatment options for these conditions.",

Dysregulation of 24-hour circadian cycles, including melatonin secretion or activity, has suggested the potential therapeutic use of melatonergic drugs for delirium. Melatonin and the melatonin analog drug ramelteon have been shown to be effective in the prevention of delirium in three controlled studies. Additional studies using these drugs are warranted.

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

We all set very high standards for ourselves.

Most of us learn how a bully behaves in the playground or at nursery school—and yet, when it happens as an adult at work we often fail to realise what is happening. Harassment or undermining behaviour can be more challenging to identify because it isn’t always obvious and can happen without colleagues being aware. Sometimes, it isn’t even apparent to those who experience it, until an event means the problem becomes overwhelming. In fact, many people who experience undermining at work perceive the problem as their own and this can have a far more insidious impact on well-being, professional performance and mental health.",

This so-called typical diurnal variation is more often found than other definable diurnal variations. The frequency cannot, however, be specified with one figure, because the quota varies, according to the criteria used, between 36.1 and 4.2%. The so-called typical diurnal variation is thus irregular, and intraindividually it also proved to be unstable. It is not specific for endogenous depressions. There is evidence of frequent shorter (ultradian) variations of depression symptomatology that are, however, difficult to record. Pharmacological therapy has little influence on the depressive diurnal variation. Sleep deprivation can revert the inverse diurnal variation and provoke a typical diurnal variation. After methodological deliberations the diagnostic and therapeutic implications are discussed.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia and chronic insomnia disorder are common conditions that frequently coexist in older adults. Existing medication treatments for each condition have risks, particularly in older adults. While treatment guidelines recommend starting with behavioural therapy for each condition, no existing program simultaneously addresses nocturia and insomnia. Existing behavioural interventions for nocturia or insomnia contain concordant and discordant components. An expert panel (including geriatricians with sleep or nocturia research expertise, sleep psychologists and a behavioural psychologist) was convened to combine and reconcile elements of behavioural treatment for each condition. Concordant treatment recommendations involve using situational self-management strategies such as urge suppression or techniques to influence homeostatic drive for sleep. Fluid modification such as avoiding alcohol and evening caffeine and regular self-monitoring through a daily diary is also appropriate for both conditions. The expert panel resolved discordant recommendations by eliminating overnight completion of voiding diaries (which can interfere with sleep) and discouraging routine overnight voiding (a stimulus control strategy). The final product is an integrated cognitive behavioural treatment that is delivered by advanced practice providers weekly over 5 weeks. This integrated program addresses the common scenario of coexisting nocturia and chronic insomnia disorder.",

      "title": "Four Faces of Baroreflex Failure",
      "abstract": "The baroreflex normally serves to buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure and heart rate occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences.Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis is the most common presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or in the absence of an acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant vagotonia with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest.Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control.",
