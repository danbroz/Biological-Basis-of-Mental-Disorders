      "abstract": "A psychological issue additionally called a psychological sickness or mental issue is a social or mental example that causes huge trouble or impedance of individual working. Such components might be determined, backsliding and dispatching, or happen as a solitary scene. Many problems have been portrayed, with signs and side effects that differ generally between explicit issues. Such problems might be analyzed by a psychological well-being proficient, generally a clinical therapist or specialist. The reasons for mental problems are regularly hazy.",

Frequently it either stimulates an organic condition involving one or more systems of the body or may aggravate symptoms of already existent organic pathology. Presence of environmental stresses and of personal conflicts in the life history of patient and the absence of physical findings on physical examination should alert the physician of this condition. Pharmacotherapy with minor tranquilizers and reassurance generally produce amelioration of symptoms.",

This conclusion is largelybased on epidemiological studies and to a lesser extent on laboratory studies with animals. It is howeverdifficult to provide objective evidence to an insurance company or a court of law that psychological stresshas been a contributing factor to the health problem of an individual or that people in certain professionsrun a risk of developing stress-related illnesses. This difficulty arises because long periods are necessary forthe development of stress related illnesses and the problem of assessing what contribution to stress resultsfrom a particular occupation as distinct from family or other life events.",

      "abstract": "Work stress is defined as the emotional and/or physical reaction that the human being has in situations that surround him; in addition it can also be defined as a physiological and psychological response of the worker. Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

The physician should rule out three psychiatric disorders in which unexplained physical symptoms often dominate the clinical picture. These are hysteria, anxiety neurosis, and depression. Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history. Hysteria and anxiety neurosis often can be managed as successfully by an internist or general practitioner as by a psychiatrist. Depression more often justifies a psychiatric referral. \"Functional\" symptoms which cannot be attributed to one of these syndromes often warrant further search for an organic cause.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

There are two broadly different mechanisms. The most obvious has a psychological or cognitive mechanism. Thus, the illness may provide the life event or chronic difficulty that triggers a depressive episode in a vulnerable Individual. Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

Examples of such events include military combat, violent personal attack, natural or humanmade disasters, and torture.

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

Yet it would be wrong to dismiss without further examination an occasion so important in the life of the mother as childbirth as of no aetiological consequence. In the types of psychosis under consideration the clinical onset had often been a sudden and disturbing event, just at that particular time in the patient's life when she was confronted with the responsibility of motherhood. Further examination of the patient's history however often revealed previous evidence of emotional disturbance, or of instability in other members of her family.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue.

But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "title": "A glossary on psychiatric epidemiology",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own. The purpose of this glossary is to provide brief definitions, sometimes with comments, of frequently used special terms one may come across in dealing with …",

      "abstract": "In the Freudian division between inhibition, symptom, and anxiety, panic is certainly more on the side of anxiety, that is, of a real that presents itself without symbolic connotations that make it placeable. It is important to see that the panic attack is a clinical phenomenon, but it is not a diagnostic category. Today, the panic attack remains one of major reasons to turn to a psychoanalyst or psychotherapist, together with a large increase in demands for relational problems: people in difficulty in their relationship as a couple or with children, or with difficulties resulting from the absence of relationships, for a loneliness not chosen and barely tolerated. Paradoxically, if in neurosis it is usually a question of deconstructing the suffering side of the symptom by dismantling it, without suppressing it, in panic it is a question of re-establishing the function of embankment that the symptom is not playing. Panic is therefore, in a way, the effect of a revelation.",

It is defined as a\r\ncondition typically characterized by symptoms of mental and physical tension or strain as depression or\r\nhypertension, which can result from a reaction to a situation in which a person feels threatened or pressured or\r\nboth .The stress which enhances function (physical or mental, such as through strength training or challenging\r\nwork) is called eustress, while persistent stress that is not resolved through coping or adaptation and may lead\r\nto anxiety or withdrawal (depression) behavior is known as distress . Medical training is identified as full of stress\r\nand it is also observed that students undergo tremendous stress during various years of medical training. In\r\nmany medical schools, the environment itself is an all prevailing pressure situation, providing an authoritarian\r\nand rigid system, one that encourages competition rather than cooperation between learners . It is not just the\r\nundergraduate study period which brings stress but it may continue during the internship, postgraduate study\r\nperiod, and later into physician's practical life . The stress may also reach burnout levels",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

Although functional gastrointestinal disorders are now an established entity, still psychogenic vomiting has its place as a temporary diagnosis till a more definitive diagnosis emerges, particularly during the developmental period. The usefulness of psychogenic vomiting is illustrated by four interrelated pediatric cases as a forerunner of formed psychopathology or as an epiphenomenon of significant psychosocial issues. Hence, psychogenic vomiting can be advocated to have a more prominent place in nosology in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

Validity is problematic because diagnosis is entirely based on signs and symptoms; there are no biological markers for any of the major mental disorders. Clinicians can under-diagnose or overdiagnose disorders, but the problem of overdiagnosis is more prevalent and more problematic. At the present state of knowledge, psychiatry does not need hundreds of diagnoses, only a few of which have established validity. Overdiagnosis is an attempt to short-circuit a process of scientific discovery that will require many more decades of research.",

This discussion however will be limited to those cases in which months or even years after a head injury, frequently of a mild type, dizziness is the outstanding or the sole complaint. This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions. Examination of the patients usually reveals no clinical signs to explain this complaint of dizziness, and therefore these patients are usually labeled as having some type of neurosis. The most common diagnoses are traumatic neurosis, traumatic hysteria, encephalopathy and traumatic encephalitis—obviously, all diagnoses of embarrassment. The physician's predicament is due to his omission of the examination of the only organ capable of producing this symptom, i. e., the vestibular apparatus. The examination of",

The close relationship between stress and migraine attacks and the significant psychiatric comorbidities in migraine provide evidence of a \"paradigm\" of tight interaction between somatic and psychological aspects in paediatric migraine. In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms. So migraine may be considered as a disorder of psychobiological adaptation in which genetic predisposition interplays with internal and/or external environmental influences such as psycho-emotional, climatic, hormonal, dietary or other factors.",

People with PTSD experience one or more major symptoms that include flashbacks and paranoia, difficulty in interpersonal relationships, and problems engaging in work and activities of daily living. In severe cases they can harm themselves or the others; but these events are preventable by appropriate therapies. PTSD is a well-characterized serious psychological and behavioural abnormality that occurs after exposure to one or more acute severe stressful events. It often occurs among soldiers returning from battlefields and the civilian victims of war. However, it also occurs in non-war situations, such as terrorist attacks or serious accidents; sexual abuse, rape, or other violent acts; and school or workplace bullying, harassment, or retaliation. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of PTSD is made too infrequently, particularly in the post-conflict periods in developing countries. This is in part because of inadequate awareness but also due to limited resources and expertise. Consequently, the resources for clinical care and research are diverted to other forms of behavioral issues, such as adjustment disorders. The treatment of PTSD needs to be well coordinated so that all stakeholders work synergistically using the resources necessary for the prolonged treatment and follow-ups. PTSD is underdiagnosed, and even misdiagnosed or mislabeled as depression or adjustment disorders. The failure to make a timely diagnosis or mislabeling of PTSD likely will harm victims and their families and may lead to negative outcomes, including suicide. The provision of appropriate, well organized, individualized, cost-effective treatment plans should alleviate PTSD symptoms and enable those with the disorder to return to their normal productive lives.

L'apparition des symptomes ulcereux, les rechutes dans la maladie, a un moment precis de l'histoire du malade ne sont pas aleatoires. Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre. Le patient semble se retrancher a l'interieur de son propre corps ou moi, sans contact possible avec l'autre trop menacant et il est comme coupe de l'interieur. Il joue sa vie a travers la maladie, faute de pouvoir assumer la marque de l'autre en lui (le manque en lui-meme).",

If measures are not made to periodically relieve these pressures, carers run a significant risk of collapsing and may have a variety of physical and emotional issues. A weaker immune system, high blood pressure, heart problems, depression, and other harmful health conditions have all been linked to prolonged stress. Any external or internal discomfort that is caused by a physical, chemical, or emotional stressor may contribute to the complaint. Stress can also be defined as a state of being. Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain. While numerous people associate the term stress with cerebral stress, scientists and croakers use this term to denote any force that impairs the stability and balance of fleshly functions.

So ist es einerseits gut bekannt, dass psychische und soziale Faktoren, „Stress“ oder auch eine Depression einen unabhängigen Risikofaktor für das Auftreten von Schlaganfällen darstellen. Umgekehrt ist es aber auch so, dass der Schlaganfall selbst zu tiefgreifenden psychischen Folgen führen kann. Insbesondere die Post-Schlaganfall-Depression spielt hier eine wichtige Rolle. Sie tritt in mindestens 1/3 aller Schlaganfall-Patienten auf und ist mit einem schlechten „Outcome“ sowie einer erhöhten Sterblichkeit assoziiert. Klinische wie experimentelle Untersuchungen aus den letzten Jahren haben zum Verständnis der vielfältigen Beziehungen zwischen Schlaganfall und Psyche beigetragen. Insbesondere die vielversprechenden Ergebnisse der FLAME-Studie, welche eine verbesserte neurologische Erholung bei der frühen Gabe von Antidepressiva bei Schlaganfall-Pa­tienten zeigte, eröffnet nun die klinische Frage, ob Schlaganfall-Patienten generell bereits zu einem frühen Zeitpunkt mit Antidepressiva behandelt werden sollten.",

Health is \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being,\" according to the World Health Organization- Our social, emotional, and physical well-being are all interconnected. Anxiety is a complex emotional state characterized by feelings of tension, worry, and physical symptoms such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. It typically arises in response to perceived threats or dangers, whether they are internal or external. While anxiety is a normal part of life and can be experienced in everyday situations, such as before a big test or public speaking event, it becomes a mental disorder when it persists over time and disrupts daily functioning",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis.

      "title": "SHOCK PRODUCED BY GENERAL ANESTHESIA",
      "abstract": "Shock as a result of simple anesthesia in the absence of trauma, hemorrhage or fright has not been carefully worked out. The term \"shock\" is unscientific. It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

      "title": "The psychiatric epidemic in the American workplace.",
      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "abstract": "Prodlužování celkového přežití onkologických pacientů a zvyšování jejich prevalence v populaci zvyšuje zájem o případné psychické problémy, přítomné ať již v průběhu léčby, nebo po ukončení léčby. Mezi nejčastější psychické problémy onkologických nemocných patří strach a úzkost, deprese, patologická únava a posttraumatická stresová porucha. Několik klinických studií prokázalo, že neléčená deprese je spojena s četnějšími somatickými komplikacemi a s horší prognózou základní nemoci než u nemocných se stejnou nemocí, ale bez deprese. K rozvoji deprese napomáhá nenaplnění \"nově vzniklých potřeb nemocných\". Psychické poruchy se mohou objevit i po ukončené léčbě. Starší psychiatři měli pro tuto situaci termín deprese z odbřemenění, dnes se tato situace nazývá posttraumatická stresová porucha. Deprese může indukovat různé bolesti, nejčastěji bolesti břicha, ale málo je známo že deprese může navodit i psychogenní horečku a psychogenní noční pocení. Někdy může být onkologické onemocnění provázeno těžkou depresí s psychotickými rysy, dřívějším termínem involuční melancholie. Problémem je také patologická únava, která v době léčby postihuje téměř všechny nemocné, ale u 30-40 % nemocných může přetrvávat i po ukončení léčby. Fyzické cvičení dle posledních poznatků má příznivý vliv jak na depresi, tak i na patologickou únavu. Z uvedených poznatků vyplývá doporučení pro hematology a onkology - včas tyto psychické komplikace odhalit a včas odeslat tyto nemocné do odpovídající psychologické či psychiatrické léčby.",

These events range from extreme high magnitude stressors such as torture, terror attacks, rape, childhood sexual abuse, natural disasters, or war to more commonly experienced stressors such as the loss of a romantic relationship, persistent physical illness, or business difficulties. Traumatic-stressor exposure is common and, for the majority of individuals exposed to stressors, normal psychological reactions that occur in the immediate aftermath will abate within days or months of the event. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder share the same traumatic stressor criteria involving \"exposure to a threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation\" and include direct experiencing, witnessing, or learning about a stressor.",

Occupational health, in its practice and research, has a key role in supporting and sustaining workers' mental health. The work relevant mental ill-health conditions that continue to prevail are occupational stress, anxiety and depression. Occupational stress is accepted as a multifaceted condition that does not arise from one specific hazard or displays one specific symptom. The management of occupational stress is likely to be unsuccessful unless a clear understanding of what may be causing the stress is gained. Burnout is a 'known' phenomenon in the workplace, with increased interest in its occurrence in recent times. Severe fatigue, a serious inability to function both physically and mentally, can occur in as many as 3% of the working population at any one time.",

Commenting on its historical aspects is difficult, since history is properly a study of primary data. Unfortunately, much clinical anecdote does not correspond to factual records of a long time ago. Even reports of objective studies may suffer from allegiance effects. This essay therefore primarily reflects the personal impact of others' work against the background of my experiences, clinical and scientific. These lead me to question the assumption that \"anxiety\", as it exists in syndromal disturbances, is simply the quantitative extreme of the normal \"anxiety\" that occurs during the anticipation of danger. An alternative view that emphasizes dysfunctions of distinct evolved adaptive alarm systems is presented.",

There are three factors namely; mental breakdown, mental disturbances, and mental illness impair the mental health of employees. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life. Workplace stress derives specifically from conditions in their workplace. This condition may either cause stress initially or aggravate the stress already present from other sources. Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

The etiology of any anxiety is sought in early conditioning life experiences; here it may be related to infants' responses to first teething. The universality of dental anxiety makes it a paradigm of psychosomatic disorders. These are conceptualized as pathologic exaggerated reactions to early traumatizing events, a causality not unlike that of conversive-hysteric symptoms or \"normal\" bodily characteristics. Psychiatric-etiologic considerations of dental anxiety are not to be found in the literature. Recalling the cheerful manner in which children's loss of their first tooth is greeted, one gathers that repressed ambivalence is involved.

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "abstract": "The interplay between physical and psychological health is important to consider if the best patient-centred outcomes are to be achieved in paediatric settings. The physical challenges of living with a vascular malformation will affect the patient's psychological health, and psychological factors will affect the patient's experience of their physical health. Psychological difficulties are typically the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. As such, having a vascular malformation will not result in the same psychological outcomes for each young person. Having a new healthy baby is a known stressor that can precipitate a range of stress-related reactions in parents, including major mental health difficulties. When a child has physical health differences, the stress can increase as a result of uncertainty about the infant's health and development and the extra health care burden of hospital attendances and daily management at home.",

The attacks are characterized by motor and/or psychic activity which is purposeful but irrelevant for the time and place, and the patient is amnesic afterward for the events that transpired during the seizure. There are no convulsive movements of either tonic or clonic nature during psychomotor seizures. Synonyms for the term psychomotor seizures are epileptic equivalents and epileptic fugue states. Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes. On the basis of these clinical facts the differentiation from petit mal epilepsy is not difficult. The activity of the patient during psychomotor seizures is quite distinct.

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

As such, it is postulated that the economic burden of anxiety disorders is greater than any other psychiatric disorder, due to the high prevalence and cost of medical and psychiatric treatment [2]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines fear as \"the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat\" and anxiety as \"anticipation of future threat.\" Fear typically induces surges of autonomic arousal and thoughts of immediate danger and escape, whereas anxiety typically manifests as muscular tension and avoidant behaviors. The anxiety disorders listed in the DSM-5 tend to be highly comorbid with other psychiatric conditions [1].

Due to their relevance, these associated disorders will be discussed briefly in this chapter. Relevant changes to anxiety disorders in the DSM-5 are outlined in Table 1. Of note, the DSM-5 requires a minimum of 6-month duration of symptoms that are not attributable to another medical condition and mental disorder or induced by a substance or medication to meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders.

Many anxiety disorders develop in early childhood and typically persist into adulthood if not adequately treated. These disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety in magnitude of reaction and/or persistence beyond developmentally appropriate periods. A thorough grasp of a proper differential diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders can be daunting; however, it may be easier to conceptualize various anxiety disorders from the perspective of the developmental spectrum, using age of onset to help guide a differential [1, 3].",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

Health anxiety is a term derived from hypochondriasis and divided into two disorders: illness anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder. Symptoms can range from mild-to-moderate expressions of worry to clinical diagnoses. Previous research has shown pregnancy-specific anxiety to be an autonomous anxiety disorder. When a woman conceives, immediate somatic changes are experienced, and although all pregnancies are different, these changes could cause either illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder. This review explores the possibility of pregnancy-specific health anxiety in greater detail.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Den overveiende del av de foreliggende epidemiologiske data kan imidlertid tolkes i retning av at stressfaktorer er av betydning for periodontal sykdom.

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

It is usually recognized by the sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and loss of general interest that accompanies it, but undoubtedly many people are given needless operations and many patients refuse to get well because the symptoms rather than the underlying depression are treated.

Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Acute psychotic symptoms can be managed with antipsychotics or benzodiazepines depending on the degree of distress and disruption to the patient, but the mainstay of treatment involves treating the underlying medical condition. Patients may also require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization for acute stabilization and to minimize the risk of harm to self or others.",

Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death.

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders. In panic disorder, panic attacks often occur at unpredictable times, making it difficult to study these episodes in the laboratory. In specific phobias, symptoms occur in very circumscribed situations and specific triggers are sometimes difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Ambulatory assessment, or ecological momentary assessment, can further the understanding of the natural course and scope of symptoms under ecologically valid circumstances. Because bodily symptoms are integral to the diagnosis of anxiety disorders, the objective assessment of physiological responses in the patients' natural environment is particularly important. On the one hand, research has highlighted intriguing discrepancies between the experience of symptoms and physiology during panic attacks. On the other hand, it has validated symptom reporting during therapeutic exposure to phobic situations. Therefore, ambulatory assessment can yield useful information about the psychopathology of anxiety disorders, and it can be used to monitor change during clinical interventions.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

Other family members may have dysmenorrhoea, indigestion, or migraine. The abdomen and head and limbs seem to be the most common sites for recurrent pains in children; chest pains or chronic backache are rarer. Although, in most patients, there is no physical cause to account for the pain, careful assessment is necessary. Chronic backache, unlike the others, is more usually a symptom of some underlying organic pathology in a child. It, and limb pains are discussed in Chapter 21.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

Types of specific anxiety disorders as classified in the DSM–IV–TR are listed in Table 4.1.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Most of the patients who use the services of the Kainuu Central hospital pain clinic suffer from low back pain. IASP (International Association of the study of Pain) defines pain as unpleasant sensory or emotional experience with possible or clear tissue damage, or which is described at the same way. Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

Hoy en día los trastornos musculoesqueléticos son los problemas más comunes entre los profesionales de salud, generando un ausentismo laboral muy alto y pérdidas económicas a la institución de salud en donde laboran. Se realizó una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica para examinar el impacto del estrés crónico en los trastornos musculoesqueléticos del profesional en el área de salud. Se consultaron bases de datos científicas como PubMed, Scopus y Web of Science, utilizando términos clave como \"estrés crónico\", \"trastornos musculoesqueléticos\", \"profesionales de la salud\" y \"salud ocupacional\". El estrés crónico en profesionales de la salud se ha revelado como un factor de riesgo significativo para el desarrollo de trastornos musculoesqueléticos. Las largas jornadas laborales, la alta demanda emocional y física, y la exposición constante a situaciones estresantes contribuyen a la tensión muscular, el dolor y la inflamación en diversas áreas del cuerpo.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

In the treatment of acute pain, the primary purpose is relief, while chronic typically requires a combination of psychotropic drugs. In this context, it is also important to recognize and treat depression. Psychological treatments aimed at providing mechanisms to allow patients to control and live with the pain rather than aspire to eliminate it completely.

Psychosis due to TBI, also referred to as PD TBI in the literature is characterized by the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions in the aftermath of traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis is difficult to make because it requires the clinician to make a determination of whether the psychosis resulted from the brain injury or whether it is a manifestation of another illness. This can be particularly challenging because there can exist a significant lag between the time of head injury and onset of psychotic symptoms. To further complicate the picture, some patients have additional neurological conditions, either primary or secondary to the TBI that may confound the presence of psychotic symptoms. Migraine and other headaches, for example, have commonly been associated with TBI.",

      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

Irritability may be a non‐specific manifestation of another psychiatric disturbance, such as depression, or part of the emotional reaction to hospitalization, pain and diagnostic procedures. Irritability, however, may also be a mood state relatively independent of other major moods of anxiety and depression. It may be associated with abnormal illness behavior. The diagnosis and treatment of irritable mood in the medically ill are reviewed. Hostility and irritability appear to be worthy of clinical and research attention in psychosomatic medicine.",

PTSD has not been demonstrated to represent a unified construct such as that established for other validated psychiatric disorders identified in this text, but a developing knowledge base for PTSD is promising for future validation of this diagnosis. PTSD is an unusual diagnosis because of the conditional nature of this disorder that requires exposure to a traumatic event for consideration of the diagnosis. Individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event cannot meet criteria for PTSD. This feature of PTSD has created difficulties in applying this diagnosis in both clinical and research settings.",

The character of the problems encountered is specific to each patient, reflecting each person's psychological, relational, and social functioning. The context in which these encounters take place is also specific. Patients often present with physical symptoms that may not lend themselves to medical explanation. The challenge in primary care is to sort out whether the physical complaints represent new medical problems or new symptoms of chronic medical problems, or somatic manifestations of psychological problems.",

The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infertility is a reproductive system condition defined by the failure to carry a clinical pregnancy following a period of 12 months or more of unprotected regular intercourse. Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

Today, this division is becoming obsolete and is harmful. Obsolete, because we are discovering changes in the tissues or in biochemical and immunological functions of the body in people with mental disorders, and because psychological complaints are frequent in all physical illnesses.

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

      "title": "[The practice of intensive care medicine as a stress situation].",
      "abstract": "A study about the problem of stress in physician who work in intensive care units requires a previous reflection about the stress concept itself. Selye's conception undoubtedly signified a great progress for the comprehension of the processes of biological adaptation, but it seems it can not be easily applied to the psychological and social field. The decrease of psychosomatic diseases during the last world war is one of the many examples that make question the causal relationship between stress and disease. The concept of life event in anglo-saxon psychiatry is also discussed, as well as its attempt to measure the stressor character of these circumstances through a scale of points. The concept of \"pathogenic situation\" of German psychiatry is proposed in exchange. From this perspective, medicine in general and intensive medicine in particular can be seen as human activities constituting \"pathogenic situations\" for the ones who exercise them. The corresponding literature allows to establish that medicine generates more pathology in physicians than other professions, but intensive medicine does not seem to be more pathogenic than other specialties. The elements of the \"medical act\" which could be responsible for the stress or pathogenic situation are studied. Respecting intensive medicine, two are the characteristics which seem to contribute to make it \"pathogenic\" for those who exercise it: a mistaken vision of death as an \"enemy\" which has to be fought à outrance, and the \"temporality of urgency\", proper to an ICU, which makes that the doctor can not give himself time enough for listening to the patient and telling him the adequate word of consolation.",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

The anxiety often results in significant levels of personal distress. Anxiety disorders are frequently co-morbid with another psychiatric disorder, such as major depressive disorder. Somatoform disorders are another type of anxiety disorder often encountered in the primary care setting. Anxiety disorders are classified into categories that reflect distinct subtypes based on their clinical manifestations.

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "The creation or discovery of animal models of psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder, is fraught with many problems that are not encountered in the development of models in other areas of medicine. Some of these problems are the result of the apparent nature and complexity of the symptoms presented by the psychiatric patient. However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state characterised by fearfulness and unwanted and distressing physical symptoms.It is a normal and appropriate response to stress but becomes pathological when it is disproportionate to the severity of the stress, continues after the stressor has gone, or occurs in the absence of any external stressor.Neurotic disorders with anxiety as a prominent symptom are common: a recent British survey found that 16% of the population suffered from some form of pathological anxiety.Anxiety disorders should be differentiated from stress reactions, in which anxiety may be a prominent feature.These include acute stress reactions-a rapid response (in minutes or hours) to sudden stressful life events, leading to anxiety with autonomic arousal and some disorientation-and adjustment reactions-slower responses to life events (such as loss of job, moving house, or divorce) that occur days or weeks later as symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depression (without biological symptoms).These are generally self limiting and are helped by reassurance, ventilation, and problem solving.A more profound stress reaction, post-traumatic stress disorder, is described below.Until recently, the commonest response to a presentation of anxiety has been to prescribe a benzodiazepine.This has been much criticised and alternatives have been evaluated, including almost all the available antidepressants and psychological treatments, especially cognitive behaviour therapy.For most general practitioners, constraints on resources are likely to mean that drugs remain the mainstay of treatment.",

      "title": "The Physiological Aspects of the Stress",
      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

The event is then persistently re-experienced. The person avoids stimuli associated with the trauma and experiences a numbing of general responsiveness. Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat. Repeated brief consultations over time can facilitate this process.",

Leitsymptome des psychiatrischen Notfalls sind Störungen des Bewusstseins, des Antriebs und der Stimmung. Ein psychiatrischer Notfall erfordert zum Ausschluss einer exogenen Ursache oder organischer Erkrankung neben der Erhebung eines differenzierten psychopathologischen Befundes obligatorisch eine körperliche Untersuchung und den Einsatz apparativer Untersuchungen. Psychiatrische Notfälle sind nach internistischen Notfällen die zweit- bis dritthäufigste Einsatzursache für einen Notarzt. Psychiatrische Störungen werden in Notaufnahmen nur zum geringen Teil erkannt und angemessen versorgt. Selbst bei gesicherter Suchtmitteleinnahme sollte nach weiteren Ursachen für die Symptomatik und nach begleitenden Verletzungen gesucht werden, damit Differenzialdiagnosen nicht übersehen werden. Für Erregungszustände und sich ankündigende Aggressivität gibt es charakteristische Prodromalsymptome. Sie können jedoch auch unvermutet und völlig unverhältnismäßig auftreten (Raptus). Über 10 % der Ärzte erleiden im Laufe ihres Berufslebens Verletzungen als Folge von Aggressivität durch Patienten. Bei Lebensbedrohung, blindwütigem Rasen oder im Erregungssturm ist das entschiedene, unmissverständliche und koordinierte Vorgehen von medizinischem Personal, Ordnungs- und Rettungskräften zur Verhinderung von Personenschäden aus zahlenmäßig hoher Überlegenheit unumgänglich. Mit der Durchführung eines Suizidversuchs ist Suizidalität in der Regel nicht erloschen. Eine Krisenintervention ist auf die unmittelbare Stabilisierung des Patienten ausgerichtet. Eine Krise wird in den seltensten Fällen durch die Krisenintervention gelöst. Die Kombination von Antipsychotika und Benzodiazepinen ist bei schweren Unruhe- und Erregungszuständen am effektivsten. Eine rasche Besserung bei ängstlichen Depressionen oder quälender innerer Unruhe kann durch Benzodiazepine (z. B. Lorazepam) erfolgen. Clomethiazol ist bei manifestem Vorliegen eines Alkoholentzugsdelirs nicht mehr gut wirksam.",

      "title": "Stress exposure, perceived stress severity, and their effects on health",
      "abstract": "While stress is one of the central concepts in many contemporary theories of health, there is no universal definition of stress or stressors. Stress is usually understood as a subjective experience of tension, pressure, distress, fear or negative emotions that occurs as a result of a perceived threat to one’s mental or physical well-being and is accompanied by an evolved biological response that facilitates adaptive reaction. While stress is conceptualized as a taxing condition, it is not understood as uniformly harmful per se. In fact, stress response is often cited as an adaptive reaction. Moreover, not every incident of stress exposure results in a disease or has an undermining effect on health. Mere exposure to stress does not warrant the healthy organism’s falling ill. Yet stress has been shown to affect health both directly and indirectly, having impact on multiple chronic conditions. Stressors vary in their severity and their ability to leave their mark on health, and it is therefore important to develop reliable methods of measuring stress to better understand how stress affects health and instigates pathology. One of the difficulties of measuring the effects of stress is connected to the distinction between external stressors and their internal appraisal. More recently, stress researchers began to make a distinction between stress exposure (i.e., facing an objectively measurable stressor) and perceived stress severity (i.e., a subjective experience of stress resulting from individual’s facing a stressor). The latter has been shown to have a superior predictive ability in terms of negative health outcomes (both breadth and depth of observed effects) compared to the former. Measurement-wise, subjective stress also tends to yield more precise results, which makes it preferable as a stress-assessment tool. The present article is a literature review study that delves into this distinction and attempts to shed light onto its implications for measuring stress and its effects on health.",

Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke.

Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes.

This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "abstract": "When it has been decided, as a result of examination and investigation, that a considerable part of the total clinical picture is due to anxiety or other emotionally determined factors, the medical and nursing professions have at their means several alternatives and combinations of treatment to use. As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

Physical or psychological demands, known as stressors, can cause strain. Stress can be identified as the process in the body for adapting to influences, changes, demands, and strains to which it is exposed. Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment.

      "abstract": "Although hysteria is connected with the idea of the womb causing illness, including headache, pain was only one of many symptoms which have been classed under the term hysteria. Patterns of anxiety with bodily symptoms and depression contributed to ancient and early modern concepts of the diagnosis. Pain became moderately prominent as a hysterical symptom from about the 18th century onwards. Only in the 19th century, with advances in anatomy, physiology and clinical medicine did it become possible to prove that there was a limited group of symptoms which resulted from the patient's idea of illness. The explanation of hysterical symptoms has depended substantially upon Freudian theory which is now undergoing a serious challenge. Hysterical pains can only be diagnosed rarely, if at all, and different efforts to describe hysteria in patients with pain have only been partially successful. Attempts to classify pain as a behavioral disorder have also been substantially unsuccessful. This may be because the psychological causes of pain are not so common as previously thought. There is also increasing reason to believe that unexplained pains have a physiological basis.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

Conceiving of depression as a stand-alone diagnostic entity repeats the mistake of assuming a division between the mind and the body. Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and generalized anxiety disorder may precede a major depression. Most mood disorders are dealt with at the level of primary care. The current understanding and clinical approach to them is dominated by a model derived from psychiatry, where there are significant differences in patient population and priorities from those in family practice. Family medicine has come under criticism for uncritically accepting this model and for failing to develop a model suitable for the family practice setting.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

A patient attending with physical symptoms may have a comorbid psychiatric illness or somatic symptoms of an underlying depression, which are perceived as a physical illness. Anxiety is an emotion experienced as a normal phenomenon in response to threat or uncertainty. Anxiety disorders occur when anxiety is out of proportion to the threat posed and also impacts on the patient's functioning. Anxiety and depression are recognised as discrete primary disorders. However, there is often some overlap between the two: most depressed patients also have some symptoms of anxiety, and many of those with more severe anxiety disorders will also have some feelings of depression.",

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

Anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and depression are familiar examples of \"distress\" and evidence has demonstrated that they are associated with prolonged exposure to stressful work. Many studies have shown an association between job strain and some form of psychological distress. Several other studies that have measured job strain and anxiety, often as part of a battery of \"psychological distress\" domains, have shown a positive correlation between high job strain and anxiety. Work-related stress can also be a factor in exacerbating pre-existing mental illnesses and may even precipitate clinically diagnosable symptoms of depression.

      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

      "title": "Functional Somatic Symptoms and Hypochondriasis",
      "abstract": "Empirical studies suggest the following main conclusions: functional somatic symptoms are extremely common; a large proportion appear to be caused by physiologic activity and tend to be aggravated by emotion. Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.",

Stres yang tidak ditangani dengan baik dapat bermanifestasi dalam bentuk gejala-gejala fisik yang disebut sebagai gejala psikosomatik. Gejala psikosomatik ini kerap kali tidak disadari sehingga sering terjadi berulang kali meski sudah diberikan pengobatan sebelumnya. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menghitung proporsi stres dan gejala psikosomatik pada siswa kelas XII SMA serta kedua keluhan tersebut pada saat yang bersamaan. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian potong lintang deskriptif. Pengambilan data dilakukan dengan menggunakan kuesioner Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) 42 dan kuesioner yang diadaptasi dari Psychosomatic Symptoms Scale for Child and Adolescents yang dibagikan kepada subjek penelitian di SMA Negeri 1 Denpasar, SMA Negeri 2 Denpasar, dan SMA Negeri 3 Denpasar pada bulan Oktober–November 2019. Sebanyak 67 (32,2%) dari 208 sampel yang mengaku mengalami stres dan terdapat 158 (76%) subjek penelitian yang mengalami gejala psikosomatik. Subjek penelitian yang mengaku mengalami stres dan juga mengalami gejala psikosomatik dijumpai sebanyak 48 (71,6%).",

Problems in diagnosis arise because of confusion of terminology, language difficulties, symptoms resembling noncardiac disease or vice versa, and the coexistence of angina pectoris with disease of other organs. Problems in differential diagnosis arise because symptoms resembling angina may result from disease or abnormal function of the brain, skeletal system, gastrointestinal system, or structures in the bony thorax or within the thoracic cage. The most difficult problems in differential diagnosis arise from psychoneurosis and gallbladder disease. Careful history taking will resolve the problem in most instances, prolonged observation will settle the question in others. To date, no objective tests have been adequate to determine whether or not the patient is subject to attacks of pain due to the physiologic effects of coronary artery pathology or dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Estrictamente hablando, la simulación no es un trastorno mental sino un problema que puede ser objeto de atención clínica. Sin embargo, se presume erróneamente que la simulación podría darse solamente en contextos forenses, lo que dificulta su identificación en ámbitos clínicos. La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental. No existen reportes previos de este trastorno en nuestro país, aunque presumiblemente su número no debe ser exiguo.

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

Стрілецький спорт можна вважати радше статичним, а не динамічним видом спорту, де динаміка присутня, але, на відмінну від таких видів спорту, як біатлон, вона у рази менша. Проблему неспецифічного болю у спині спортсменів-стрільців вивчено недостатньо, є велика кількість причин через виникнення болю – від генетично успадкованих захворювань до того, що спортсмен змінив поставу заради досягнення більш кращого результату. Це дослідження було спрямоване на вивчення впливу неспецифічного болю не тільки на результати на змаганнях, а і на життя спортсмена в цілому. Неспецифічний біль у спині є багатофакторною проблемою, яку потрібно розглядати в широкому аспекті, бо, окрім успадкованих захворювань, порушення постави може виникати і через тривалий стрес, через низькі результати на змаганнях або завеликий об’єм тренувальної діяльності. Будь-який з цих аспектів може впливати на виникнення неспецифічного болю у спині. Було проведене опитування спортсменів, щоб дізнатись, наскільки сильно впливає неспецифічний біль у спині на тренувальну діяльність та життя спортсмена. Мета та завдання – проаналізувати стан спортсменів-стрільців з проявами неспецифічного болю у спині за допомогою сучасних наукових досліджень. Методи дослідження. Проведено опитування спортсменів-стрільців різних спортивних звань з неспецифічним болем у спині. Результати дослідження.

Аналіз даних показує, що досить багато спортсменів-стрільців має проблеми з неспецифічним болем у спині. Така проблема потребує вирішення. Необхідне подальше надання допомоги спортсменам задля того, щоб спортсмени могли у майбутньому показували більш якісні результати і мали більше можливостей для продовження тренування та вдосконалення їх навичок. Також потрібні подальші досліди для визначення ефективного способу відновлення спортсменів з цією проблемою.",

      "abstract": "There are many indications that distress within the family as well as at work are strong predictors for developing stress-related disorders. The relatively new diagnoses burnout, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia syndrome probably represent different ways of reacting to an overwhelming situation. The boundary between these diseases, on the one hand, and depression, heart disease or infarction on the other is often diffuse, and the new diagnoses may well delineate preliminary stages of more serious diseases such as angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. There is evidence that also other causes of death may be related to stress. These circumstances reflect not only considerable suffering on the part of individuals, but also a substantial economic burden for society.",

L’augmentation continue du nombre de suicides au travail, dont les médias se font régulièrement l’écho, en témoigne. La France est l’un des pays les plus touchés. Pourtant, les réponses proposées dans le monde de l’entreprise restent limitées à la gestion du stress, semblant ignorer l’existence de réels troubles de l’humeur d’origine professionnelle. Il est vrai que la plupart des intervenants au sein des entreprises n’ont pas de formation psychiatrique. Il existe d’authentiques dépressions professionnelles qui surviennent suite à des difficultés dans le monde du travail et s’expriment principalement au travail. Ces dépressions représentent la majeure partie des dépenses médicales occasionnées par les problèmes de santé mentale. La dépression des dirigeants d’entreprise, souvent méconnue, est un facteur causal de certaines faillites. La sémiologie est spécifique, les éléments de prise en charge et de prévention primaire, sont très différents de ceux du stress professionnel. De la même façon, le cadre législatif est surprenant. La dépression n’existe pas dans le tableau des maladies professionnelles, et sa reconnaissance hors tableau est difficile, avec en particulier, une absence de présomption d’origine. Au contraire, le suicide est désormais fréquemment reconnu comme accident du travail. Notre intervention, après avoir rappelé la sémiologie spécifique des troubles de l’humeur d’origine professionnelle, fera le point sur les aspects de prévention spécifique et sur les éléments de prise en charge. Nous présenterons, pour conclure, la prise en charge que nous avons mise en place dans un établissement bancaire français.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

The findings suggest that burnout can take place among representatives of older age and more it is continued, provided professional activities. The cessation of the work activities leads to stress, often with the subsequent development post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced diseases. However in this case the clinical symptoms of the syndrome of emotional burnout, does not disappear, but only happens their clinical transformation attach various psychosomatic disorders. Thus, the elderly, suffering the syndrome of emotional burnout, are at high risk group with regard to the formation and development of diseases, associated with stress and require close monitoring in the framework of the compulsory program of medical examination.В статье представлены результаты сравнительного исследования клинических проявлений синдрома эмоционального выгорания у 84 работающих по специальности врачей-терапевтов женщин пожилого возраста и 48 официально прекративших работу по данной специальности. Полученные данные указывают на то, что синдром эмоционального выгорания может иметь место у лиц пожилого возраста, и он более всего связан с продолжающейся профессиональной деятельностью. Прекращение данной трудовой деятельности приводит к стрессу, нередко с последующим развитием посттравматического стрессового расстройства и стресс-индуцированных заболеваний. При этом клинические проявления самого синдрома эмоционального выгорания не исчезают, а лишь трансформируются с присоединением различных психосоматических нарушений. Таким образом, пожилые, страдающие синдромом эмоционального выгорания, являются группой риска в отношении формирования и развития заболеваний, связанных со стрессом, и нуждаются в пристальном наблюдении в рамках обязательной программы диспансеризации.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious. Many diagnostic constructs—medical or psychiatric—involve complex polygenetic interactions with the environment.",

The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition. To be preferred is the expression ‘idiopathic pain’ with its implication of a disorder of pain perception, or ‘pain of unknown aetiology’.

Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "abstract": "Clinical zoanthropy is a rare delusion in which a person believes himself or herself to be an animal.To assess the clinical and scientific relevance of this classical diagnostic category.A search was conducted in the classical and scientific literature and in PubMed, Embase, and Ovid.Only 56 cases of clinical zoanthropy could be found in the international scientific literature. Since specific studies have yielded a relatively large numbers of cases in the past, it can be concluded that the disorder is probably more prevalent than is suggested in the literature. These cases may well be not only primary types, based on mental or unclear causes, but also secondary types, mediated by aberrant somatosensory sensations. Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions. All cases that occur should be subjected to extra somatic investigations – including an EEG and neuroimaging – and treatment should be adjusted in accordance with the findings.",

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

It may also happen that the presence of a chronic disease changes the social situation of a patient, who then responds to the change by developing depression. Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

      "abstract": "Chronic therapy-resistant low back pain is a major problem in medical care. In Germany there are many millions concerned, and the treatment expenses range at the top. Many of these patients underwent non-successful operations at the vertebral column and suffered a long-lasting odyssey of therapies before they are treated psychosomatically for the first time. Chronic low back pain is a disease including social, psychological as well as physiological aspects, and not only a problem of bones, muscles, or intervertebral disks. The problem is similar to that of fibromyalgia. On the basis of 9,000 case reports obtained during psychosomatic orthopedic treatment, character structures, unsolved problems of life and repressed emotional disturbances such as anger, jealousy, fear, and mourning could be identified as major psychosomatic risk factors for chronic low back pain. There is a high coincidence with other psychosomatically influenced diseases such as gastric and duodenal ulcera, asthma bronchiale, migraine with depressions, anxiety disorders, character neuroses, and narcissistic and other structural disturbances of the self. Exclusively somatic treatments without considering the existential situation and psychological methods hold the danger of a symptom shifting. The inpatient treatment from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ('Tagesklinik') with a combination of medical, physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic methods promotes a social training that counteracts the increasing constrictions in the accustomed life surroundings caused by low back pain. Chronic low back pain is an 'illness of the upright walk' in an anthropological, ethical sense. Considering low back pain as a strictly somatic disease is a modern myth of a medical treatment without existential understanding of human illness. It provokes failure of treatment and an enhancement of treatment cost.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Mental trauma or psychological injury has been underdiagnosed as a basis for litigation, and attorneys often overlook the need to screen accident victims and family members. Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain is a personal experience which makes it difficult to define and measure. It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

There is as yet little empirical research on the validity of the diagnosis. Literature on disasters, civilian and wartime, and on more ordinary stressful life events does not support the view that extreme stressors form a discrete class of stressors in terms of the probability of psychiatric sequelae or the distinctive nature of subsequent psychopathology. Extraordinary stressors are like more ordinary stressful events with respect to their complex differential effects upon individuals. Personal characteristics and the nature of the social environment modify the likelihood and form of the response of individuals to all types of stressors.",

During adolescence, there are many things that cause people in general to experience mental disorders. Some mental disorders that usually occur are caused by various existing stressors which can cause anxiety disorders, depression and lead to suicide. Adolescents who grow up in a conducive environment will rarely experience mental disorders which are usually suffered by most teenagers who experience these mental disorders. This mental disorder can be prevented. There are many mental disorders whose symptoms and causes are difficult to determine. It is sometimes difficult to see the difference between ordinary teenage moodiness and signs of more serious illness, although the illness usually begins in late adolescence or young adulthood.

      "abstract": "Acute pain hurts and most often is the result of tissue injury. Chronic pain also hurts. Although those who suffer from chronic pain also tend to associate the onset with an injury, illness, or surgical procedure; the root cause is far more complex. Chronic pain most often does not follow dermatomal distributions associated with any injury, disease or surgical procedure. And more often than not, chronic pain sufferers also suffer from various forms of depression and/or anxiety. The process of central sensitization resulting from tissue injury has been elucidated, as has many of the molecular changes within the brain that perpetuate chronic pain. Genetics, epigenetics, environmental stressors, and emotional stressors all play roles to varying degrees in the development of the chronic pain state. This article explores how synaptic memories form in the brain as a result of both physical and emotional traumas (multiple hits) resulting in progression to chronic pain, because of failure of the brain’s descending modulatory mechanisms to prevent or control “the pain”.",

Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

Ruhsal etkilenmeler, geçici olabileceği gibi ciddi, uzun süre tedavi gerektirebilen ve hatta bazen kalıcı özellik gösteren ruhsal bozukluklar olarak ortaya çıkabilmektedir. Travmalara bağlı olarak en sık görülen ruhsal bozukluk, travma sonrası stres bozukluğudur. Bulguları; yetişkinler, çocuklar ve adolesanlarda farklılık gösterebilmektedir. Özellikle çocuklarda bu tür etkilenmeler, normal gelişimsel süreci önemli derecede etkileyebilmektedir. Bu nedenle, travma olgularında ayrıntılı değerlendirme önem taşımaktadır. Ruhsal değerlendirme ve tanı koyma sürecinin çoğunlukla hastanın anlattıklarına dayalı olması, simülasyon açısından en riskli durumlar olmalarına sebep olmaktadır. Ayrıca, kişilerin tazminat davalarında maddi bir çıkar elde etme iç güdülerinin kimi zaman bazı değerlerin önüne geçmesi, travma ilişkili ruhsal bozuklukları değerlendiren hekimlerin bu konuda daha dikkatli olmalarını gerektirmektedir. Değerlendirilen olgularda şüpheye düşülmesi, kesin bir kanaatin oluşmaması durumlarında, kişinin gözlem altında tutularak değerlendirilmesinin istenebileceği bilinmelidir. Bu bölümde, travmalarda en sık görülen ruhsal hastalık olan travma sonrası stres bozukluğunun tanı kriterlerini ve klinik özelliklerini, travmalarda görülen ruhsal bozuklukların ceza ve tazminat hukukundaki yerini ve travmalardan sonra görülebilen ruhsal etkilenmelerin adli tıbbi değerlendirmesinde dikkat edilmesi gereken kriterleri belirtmek amaçlanmıştır.",

Osim ostecenja dijelova tijela, nakon politraume osoba može imati i traumatsku ozljedu mozga koja ce utjecati na oporavak i daljnje funkcioniranje bolesnika, ovisno o stupnju i težini ozljede. Bolesnik nakon politraume zahtijeva dugotrajnu hospitalizaciju i lijecenje te samim time dugotrajnu ili cak i trajnu promjenu životnih navika. Psiholoski ucinak ozljede ukljucuje razvoj akutnih i dugorocnih mentalnih problema kao sto su posttraumatski stres, depresija i anksioznost. Posttraumatski stresni poremecaj (PTSP) je najcesce istraživani problem mentalnog zdravlja nakon zadobivanja tjelesnih ozljeda. Prepoznavanje rane pojave poremecaja i ranih simptoma pružaju mogucnosti za rano otkrivanje i prevenciju. Anksioznost se također javlja kod preživjelih nakon politraume, a neki karakteristicni simptomi anksioznosti ukljucuju povecano uzbuđenje i fizicke simptome kao sto su tahikardija, tahipneja i suhoca sluznice usta. Osnovna patofiziologija depresivnog poremecaja nije jasno definirana. Postojeci dokazi upucuju na složenu interakciju između neurotransmitera i regulacije receptora te osjetljivosti koja leži u pozadini afektivnih simptoma.

Uloga medicinske sestre kod bolesnika s psihickim poremecajima nakon politraume je prepoznati simptome koji dovode do određenog poremecaja, te provođenje intervencija prema odredbi lijecnika, uz stvaranje empatijskog odnosa prema bolesniku te pružanje sigurnosti i emocionalne potpore.",

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

Today, social phobia is the third most common psychiatric disorder that, left untreated, has been shown to have a marked impact upon the quality of life and success of sufferers. Specific pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies used simultaneously or alone, have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of this disorder.",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definition and deviations”).",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness. His delusions did not respond to conventional treatment with psychotropic medication possibly due to non-adherence because of side effects.

      "title": "Psychopathology in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.).

Depression is accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of taste to life, interest in usual activities. Being a mental disorder, depression manifests itself as pathological affect. It is perceived by people and patients as a manifestation of laziness, bad character, selfishness and pessimism. It should be noted that a depressive state is not just a bad mood, but a psychosomatic disease in which specialist intervention required. Overthinking or intrusive thoughts depression or anxiety or any mental problem isn't just a disorder, it can happen to us because of various reasons.",

      "abstract": "Pendidikan kedokteran merupakan jurusan akademik yang sangat diminati dan ditargetkan oleh banyak kalangan. Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya, seorang mahasiswa kedokteran harus menghadapi berbagai tuntutan akademik yang berat dan dapat menyebabkan kesehatan mentalnya terganggu. Gangguan kesehatan mental merupakan kondisi seseorang mengalami gangguan psikologis sehingga menyebabkan perubahan negatif pada kesejahteraan hidup, fisiologis kejiwaan, dan kecakapan hidup. Beberapa contoh gangguan ini adalah perasaan stres, cemas, dan depresi. Stres merupakan reaksi tertekan pada tubuh terhadap besarnya tuntutan dan kewajiban yang harus dilakukan dalam waktu tertentu. Cemas adalah kondisi seseorang yang merasa gelisah, takut, dan khawatir yang terlalu berlebihan terhadap masa depan. Depresi merupakan kondisi berkurangnya energi tubuh, berkurangnya minat dalam menjalankan aktivitas sehari-hari, serta perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan. Segala stresor yang menyebabkan gangguan kesehatan mental ini tidak hanya didapatkan dari proses pembelajaran, namun juga didapatkan dari kondisi eksternal, seperti tekanan dari teman sejawat, finansial, dan keluarga. Gangguan kesehatan mental mampu memberikan pengaruh besar bagi mahasiswa kedokteran dalam melaksanakan aktivitas perkuliahannya, salah satunya adalah pengaruhnya terhadap hasil Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter (UKMPPD). UKMPPD merupakan exit exam nasional bagi mahasiswa program profesi dokter yang harus diambil sebelum mengangkat sumpah dokter, ujian ini terdiri atas Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) dan Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Kondisi mental yang tidak sehat berpengaruh pada kinerja mahasiswa dalam menganalisis setiap materi yang akan dipelajari. Besarnya beban mental yang ditampung mahasiswa akan membuat diri mereka tidak fokus untuk mempelajari materi secara terstruktur sehingga tidak semua materi dapat dipelajari dengan baik. Hal ini bermuara pada hasil UKMPPD yang tidak optimal.",

It has a massive personal and socioeconomic impact, as it is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. Both young and old people are affected, as a result of traffic or sports accidents as well as due to falls at home. The term TBI encompasses various clinical pictures, differing considerably in cause, prognosis and therapy. What they all have in common is the pathophysiological cascade that develops immediately after the initial trauma and which can persist for several days and weeks. In this phase, medical treatment, whether surgical or pharmacological, attempts to reduce the consequences of the primary damage. The aim is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and to reduce intracranial pressure.Das Schädel-Hirn-Trauma (SHT) bezeichnet eine durch äußere Gewalteinwirkung bedingte Schädigung des Gehirnparenchyms. Es verursacht massive individuelle und sozioökonomische Folgen aufgrund der hohen Morbidität und Mortalität. Betroffen sind junge Menschen durch Verkehrs- oder Sportunfälle, aber auch zunehmend alte Menschen durch Stürze im häuslichen Umfeld. Der Begriff SHT umfasst mehrere Krankheitsbilder, die sich in Ursache, Prognose und Therapie unterscheiden. Allen gemein sind jedoch komplexe pathophysiologische Kaskaden, die sich sofort nach dem initialen Trauma entwickeln und über mehrere Tage und Wochen anhalten können. In dieser Phase versucht eine medizinische Behandlung, sei sie chirurgisch oder medikamentös, die Folgen des Primärschadens zu reduzieren. Die Erhaltung eines adäquaten zerebralen Perfusionsdrucks und die Reduktion des Hirndrucks stehen im Vordergrund.",

The factors initiating the headache included disturbed family patterns, family phobia, differential parenting styles including over expectations or ignoring. The heavy school work lead to fear of studies that in turn affected the attendance and the scholastic performance. To some extent, the surrounding environmental factors also lead to difficulty in social adjustment. These certain issues lead to stress headaches for most of the children almost every day. In no case, any family history of any psychiatric illness, traumas or any such kind of headaches as those of migraine, sinusitis, etc. was understood.

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "title": "PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "Psychotherapy of psychosomatic disorders in adolescents is one of the most responsible tasks a therapist could undertake. The psychosomatic spectrum of disorders in children aged between 5 and 18 years is widespread. The similarity between the various symptoms lies in the fact that they are masked gratified desires, but not in an adequate but neurotic manner. Psychotherapy should be approached individually and the personality traits and characteristics of adolescents should be taken into account. This article looks at some of the most common disorders and the causes of them. The focus is not on eliminating the symptom, but on the cause of it. Many clients have serious difficulties in understanding the full dynamics of a psychosocial syndrome. Psychosomatic disorders belong to a larger group known as psychogenic diseases, which can generally be considered as physical diseases caused or modified by the brain for purely psychological reasons. Psychosomatic pain is often due to hidden emotions. Grief, stress, and anxiety can all occur physically. If the patient has recently had a traumatic experience, this may give the therapist an idea of where these symptoms originate. Other times, the root of the problem may be less obvious. People who have experienced deep emotional trauma in the past may have buried those emotions, which would be expressed through physical pain years, even decades later. A remnant of anger and rage from childhood that has never been expressed can be a serious cause of a psychosomatic symptom or illness. For example sexual, physical or emotional abuse, parental problems, including alcoholism, depression, anxiety, drug addiction, psychosis, unrealistic parental expectations of the child, social tension, and others resulting from self-imposed tension (i.e. internal conflict), stress and tension from everyday life. Let us not forget that psychosomatic manifestations, in the form of physical symptoms, can be a protective mechanism of the brain. The brain diverts attention to the body to prevent the awareness of confrontation of some unconscious, repressed or threatening feelings, in particular anger/rage. Once the individual accepts this explanation and is aware of the brain's strategy for diverting attention from emotions to the body, the physical symptoms may disappear. Often there is no medical explanation for the symptoms - there is a pain but no evidence of illness. Symptoms begin when a person reaches their physical and emotional limits. This limit is specific to each person. Psychoanalysts speak of a psychosomatic personality type. Psychosomatic disorder is a way of coping with illness. Symptoms are an indicator of an overall imbalance and a need for personality harmonization.",

The actual prevalence varies according to the setting, type and severity of disease, the individual's perception of their condition and premorbid risk factors (e.g. childhood adversity). Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients. The information is based on scholarly information supported by research and practical suggestions based on cumulative clinical experiences of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Panic reactions—i. e., maximal fear states which result from prolonged tension and insecurity, occur in certain constitutional make-ups as a reaction to specific life situations. Panics develop as a climax of a tension depression, or they may form an important and prolonged phase in depressions with uneasiness and anxiety. This latter group has been described as an anxiety psychosis (Wernicke). I distinguish these two groups of leading panics from mere incidental panics, which may occur in any psychosis or psychoneurosis. A thorough discussion of the literature shows the development of the concept of panic in psychiatry and reviews especially the attitude to the impure affects of anxiety, fear, panic and fright. Impure affects have to be studied from a genetic-dynamic point of view. This leads to the recognition of their far-reaching influence. Much of what has been diagnosed schizophrenic admixtures can be explained by impure affects. The term tension depression which is used in this paper does not coin a new disease entity, but describes reactions of an attack type in which tension and its symptoms are the outstanding complaint and in which the depressive affect seems to play a subordinate rOle. Because of their course and their close relation to depressions, tension depressions are considered to belong to the affective reaction type. From a formal point of view we distinguish between paranoid and disorganizing panics. Their relation to paranoic and schizophrenic reactions is fully discussed.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "Physical fatigue is a painful phenomenon which is localised in overstressed muscles. Mental fatigue is a diffuse sensation of weariness; it is a functional state, one of several intermediate conditions between the two extremes of alarm and sleep. A neurophysiological model of fatigue, involving an activating and inhibitory system has been developed. Fatigue in industrial practice has clinical symptoms: psychic instability, fits of depression and increased liability to illness. Indicators of fatigue are work of performance, subjective feelings of fatigue, electroencephalography, flicker-fusion frequency and various psychomotor and mental tests. Several field studies do, to some extent, confirm the above-mentioned concept of fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may develop in some children and adolescents after exposure to a traumatic event. Traumatic events may include incidents that involve serious harm to self or others and include accidents, natural disasters, sexual or physical trauma, natural disasters, and violence.Since time immemorial, scientists have pursued the ever-elusive causal origins of disease processes. To the detriment of humanity, these endeavors frequently resulted in fruitless pursuits, as we still can only postulate the etiologies of many illnesses. Thus, the causal nature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) places it in the company of a scant few psychiatric diagnoses where etiology is known. The temporal association between the event exposure and the subsequent symptom manifestation is not simply a post hoc fallacy. Not to be misled by the putative simplistic nature of the etiology, the consequent psychiatric sequelae can, in turn, be debilitating. Moreover, recent studies have unmasked unsettling discoveries regarding pediatric considerations in the setting of PTSD. It has been suggested that a substantial number of children have gone inappropriately undiagnosed because of the insufficient sensitivities of previous guidelines. Children often react differently to stressful events, and because of this, the pediatric phenomenology of PTSD differs from that of the adults. The transition from DSM IV to DSM-V acknowledges this inconsistency, made evident by the additional criteria specific to PTSD for children six years or younger. PTSD is defined by four symptom clusters, including avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, intrusion, and hyperarousal per DSM-5. The consequences of PTSD are often deleterious with adverse outcomes in physical and mental health besides impaired social and occupational functioning.",

Any individual who presents with cognitive decline following a history of concussion should undergo a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation, and this should be coupled with a detailed medical and neurological exam to assess for all possible causes of impaired cognition. Neurodegeneration should not be assumed as a result of prior brain injury.",

The effect of a constant or constantly recurring cause of disturbance may be seen to produce not only the simpler forms of mental disorder, but may also be recognised as a true cause of the gravest form of nervous disease. The mind may be upset, just as the temper may be ruined, by slight domestic worries; and this disturbance of mind may be followed by disease of the brain. In my experience, the brain is destroyed in general paralytics more frequently by constant causes of excitement or anxiety and worry, than by any sudden injury or shock.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

      "title": "Depressive disorders in patients with epilepsy: Why should neurologists care?",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a complex disorder that is commonly associated with brain dysfunction, social isolation, and vocational difficulty. Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric illness in epilepsy, but emerging evidence is providing a more complete and clearer elucidation of the problem. Clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with quality of life than does the seizure rate. In fact, depression is second only to medication toxicity as the clinical factor that explains the greatest variance in quality of life. Only a small number of studies have investigated the plausible neurobiological mechanisms of depression in epilepsy, but preliminary data suggest that underlying brain dysfunction may be a more important predictor than vocational or social disability. Furthermore, specific aspects of hippocampal dysfunction may be a causal factor in the genesis and maintenance of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management are expected to become available in the near future.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence.

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients. The syndrome requires differentiation from depressive and phobic disorders and from physical conditions which produce anxiety.",

Manifestations of patient anxiety can take different forms, ranging from simple agitation, sometimes accompanied by physiological manifestations to extreme forms of lipothymia or even myocardial infarction. Panic attacks can occur as well, as one of the manifestations of anxiety. The problem that occurs in the dentist's office is the correct and rapid diagnosis of panic attack and establishing a differentiated diagnosis with other conditions that can endanger the patient's life, such as heart attack. Also, the dentist must prevent, know and apply the treatment immediately in case of a panic attack. For these reasons we consider of the utmost importance the approach of this subject in this paper.",

The main anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety, panic attack, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (characterized by excessive fear and worry about being exposed to the scrutiny of other people), agoraphobia (characterized by fear and panic that are associated with situations or places) and specific phobias (characterized by anxiety about specific objects).

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Die Depression in der Postpartalzeit: eine diagnostische und therapeutische Herausforderung",
      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

Observable signs do exist, such as autonomic arousal in someone describing a subjective feeling of anxiety, or evidence of concomitant activity in the cortex while describing auditory hallucinations. But the reported experience is often the only evidence available. The first and most basic problem, therefore, is to decide whether a symptom is present or absent.

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are sensory experiences that appear real but are created by your mind. They can affect all five of your senses. For example, you might hear a voice that no one else in the room can hear or see an image that isn’t real. These symptoms may be caused by mental illnesses, the side effects of medications, or physical illnesses like epilepsy or alcohol use disorder. You may need to visit a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a general practitioner depending on the cause of your hallucinations. Treatment may include taking medication to treat a health condition. Your doctor may also recommend adopting different behaviours like drinking less alcohol and getting more sleep to improve your hallucinations",

Similar experiences arising later in childhood seem to have a less disruptive effect. Instead of speaking of a \"vulnerable child syndrome\" we might do better with the terms \"neonatal crisis syndrome\" or even the \"ominous infant phenomenon,\" since these broader descriptions allow for the inclusion and expansion of the concepts discussed in this thoughtful set of reflections. Improved attention to these matters is justifiable on the basis of humane considerations alone, and need not await further studies.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury in Children: The Psychological Effects of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "abstract": "Chest pain is a common presenting problem to general practitioners and accident and emergency departments. Such a symptom generates anxiety in both patients and their medical attendants, for fear that this symptom represents a life threatening event. Numerous investigations often ensue, adding to the physical and financial burden on an already stressed health system. Musculoskeletal causes of chest pain are common but frequently overlooked.This article aims to outline some of the more common musculoskeletal problems which may present as chest pain, and to present a practical approach to their diagnosis and management.It is estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of 20-25% of noncardiac chest pain has a musculoskeletal basis. Careful history taking to identify red flag conditions differentiates those who require further investigation. Historical features suggesting a musculoskeletal cause include pain on specific postures or physical activities. A musculoskeletal diagnosis can usually be confirmed by clinical examination alone, the key to which is reproducing the patient's pain by either a movement or more specifically palpation over the structure that is the source of the pain. Confirming the diagnosis, explanation and reassurance allay anxiety. Management strategies include manual therapy, the provision of analgesia and anti-inflammatory agents, either topically, orally or by injection. Focal injection of local anaesthetic alone may also be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool.",

      "abstract": "Amaç: Patolojik endişe anksiyete bozukluklarını önemli bir göstergesi ve tetikleyicisi olarak önemli rol oynayan bir psikolojik olgudur. Patolojik anksiyete, belli bir uyarana karşı, süresi ve şiddeti bakımından uygun olmayan bir psikolojik yanıt olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Aşırı, sürekli ve kontrol edilemeyen endişe ise yaygın anksiyete bozukluğu için tanı ölçütleri arasında yer almaktadır. Bunun ötesinde, patolojik endişenin anksiyeteyle ilişkili bilişsel unsuru oluşturduğu ve uyumu bozucu bir savunma olarak kullanıldığı düşünülmektedir. Bununla birlikte, sürekli ve kontrol edilemeyen endişenin olumsuz sonuçları sadece anksiyete bozukluklarıyla sınırlı kalmamaktadır. Son zamanlarda patolojik endişenin panik bozukluğu, obsesif-kompulsif bozukluk, depresyon, uyku bozukluğu ve psikotik bozukluklarla ilişkisini gösteren çalışmaların sayısı hızla artmaktadır. Yine sürekli ve kontrol edilemeyen endişenin kalp hastalıkları, diyabet ve kanser gibi tıbbi problemlerle ilişkisini gösteren çalışmalar bulunmaktadır. Yapılan çalışmalarda genellikle patolojik endişenin yol açtığı sonuçlar psikolojik ve somatik sonuçların çalışıldığı görülmektedir. Bu çalışmada ise patolojik endişenin duygu durum değişkenleri, benlik saygısı ve demografik özelliklerden ne ölçüde etkilendiği araştırılmıştır. Yöntem : Çalışmaya 323 üniversite öğrencisi katılmıştır (160 kadın). Bu çalışmada patolojik endişeyi etkileyen psikolojik faktörleri belirleyebilmek amacıyla bağımlı değişken olan Penn State Endişe Ölçeği (PSEÖ), bağımsız değişkenlerin ölçümü ise, Beck Depresyon Envanteri (BDE), Beck Anksiyete Envanteri (BAE) ve Rosenberg Benlik Saygısı Ölçeği (RBSÖ) ile yapılmıştır. Ayrıca demografik özelliklerin de endişe üzerindeki etkisi de ele alınmıştır. Bulgular : Çoklu regresyon analizinde kız öğrencilerin erkeklere göre endişeye daha yatkın oldukları görülmüştür. Bunun yanı sıra endişe düzeylerinin depresyon ve anksiyeteyle doğru yönde ilişkili olduğu bulunmuştur. Benlik saygısıyla patolojik endişe puanları ters yönde ilişkili olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Sonuç : Patolojik endişe düzeyleri olumsuz duygulanıma ve düşük benlik saygısına bağlı olarak artış göstermektedir. Sonuçlar literatürdeki bulgular ışığında tartışılmıştır. Anahtar Kelimeler : Patolojik Endişe, Anksiyete; Depresyon; Benlik saygısı",

Within the social approach, there are three dominant theories of mental illness etiology: stress theory, structural strain theory and labeling theory. This chapter describes each theory's basic concepts and assumptions, theoretical limitations and advantages, and implications for treating or preventing mental illness. According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

      "title": "Guidelines in the management of diabetic nerve pain clinical utility of pregabalin",
      "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Psyche, personality and gut functions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

Determining whether these consequences of stroke may be improved by treatment of depression constitutes both a major challenge and an enormous opportunity for new approaches to poststroke pharmacotherapy. Previous controlled and uncontrolled treatment trials have provided partial support for the hypothesis that mood, cognitive, physical, and survival consequences of poststroke depression may be improved by antidepressant therapy.",

Symptoms in psychiatry are psychological but physical symptoms may also be prominent, especially in anxiety and depression. Pious platitudes abound concerning the usefulness of non-systematic clinical observations. The clinician's solution to this problem is to use as his working standard, not a formal diagnosis, but an informal formulation. The usual design is the parallel-groups design where patients are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatments. Cogent reasons are needed not to use this standard approach.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Intense or chronic stress can have long-lasting consequences in an individual's health, and can be the cause of debilitating mental illnesses. A very common mental illness induced by traumatic stress is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a syndrome of symptoms indicative of emotional dysfunction, which develop after exposure to life-threatening events, or very stressful situations of different nature. Prevalent symptoms are fear and anxiety, which become particularly intense during exposure to situations reminiscent of the traumatic events that precipitated the disease. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder of considerable prevalence and morbidity and can affect persons of any age and ethnic or socioeconomic background. It is, unfortunately, a far too common result of participation in wars. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of PTSD is even higher in inner city communities exposed to compound community trauma. It is imperative, therefore, to understand the neurobiological mechanisms by which exposure to traumatic stress leads to PTSD in order to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD. Clinical evidence indicates that certain stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD are associated with changes in the amygdala's excitability. The amygdala is a key component of the brain's neuronal network that determines the emotional significance of external events",

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

Pain assessment is based on common legal and certification standards. However, typical decision and rating problems result from the difficulty of objective medical registration and grading of pain.

      "abstract": "Mental stress in humans, on the face of it, is the perception of unease, of various degrees, in response to stressors, such as, threats, emotional, economic, socioeconomic and political instabilities, and other conditionssome due to geopolitical conditions and some emblematic of modern timeswhich create intense and/or difficult brain engagements. However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "Patients present with a diagnostic puzzle of physical and psychological signs and symptoms. It is a challenge for psychiatrists and other physicians to accurately diagnose and treat the patient. There are patients who insist that they have a medical problem and whose claim is not confirmed by physical examination or laboratory testing. The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses. When it comes to the diagnostic consideration of a psychiatric versus a medical condition we know that it is not either/or but it often is both.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

      "abstract": "The nervous system is commonly impacted by chemicals found in nature, elaborated by organisms, or synthesized by chemists. The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "abstract": "Cancer is the most feared of diseases.Unsurprisingly, it causes considerable psychological distress in patients, families, carers, and often those health professionals who care for them.Only a minority of cancer patients develop psychiatric illness, but other psychologically and socially determined problems are common.These include unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue; problems with finances, employment, housing, and childcare; family worries; and existential and spiritual doubts.Well planned care that fully involves patients and their families can minimise these problems. Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The intentional killing of oneself is evidence not only of personal breakdown, but also of a deterioration of the social context in which an individual lives. Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly.

      "abstract": "Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or [is] described in terms of uch dama e” when there is no h sical deran ement 1 The function of ain is to protect the body by making the organism aware of damaging events and to promote healing by causing sensitivity to movement or other stimuli that may delay recovery. However, pain is not always related to tissue damage and does not always serve a protective function. This is the case with neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory parts of the nervous system, and with some other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and migraine.2 Acute and chronic pain may cause suffering and interfere with daily life, factors that influence the choice of treatment. Acute pain is the most common reason for visiting an emergency department,3 and surgical procedures are often associated with acute postoperative pain.4,5 Chronic pain also causes suffering, as reflected by the finding in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 that chronic low back pain was the leading cause of years lived with disability.6 In addition to the contribution of pain to disability, that study showed that the associated problem of opioid use disorders accounted for 5.8 million additional years lived with disability,6 an observation that underpins attempts to treat pain with drugs other than opioids. Long-term opioid administration has minimal effects on chronic pain and can cause tolerance, drowsiness, and dependence, as well as impaired memory, concentration, and judgment.7 For these reasons, the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends caution in prescribing opioids for chronic pain,8 and there has been an increased emphasis on the use of nonopioid pain management. The choice of treatment for pain depends on many factors, and the heterogeneity and large number of acute and chronic pain conditions preclude a general treatment algorithm. In cooperation with the World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a classification of chronic pain for the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases2 (Table 1), and a similar classification has been proposed for acute pain,5 providing the bases for facilitating treatment pathways.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

Bien que la morphine et ses dérivés soient reconnus comme les antalgiques de référence dans les douleurs modérées à sévères, des études expérimentales et cliniques montrent clairement que leur administration donne naissance à des hypersensibilités durables à la douleur pouvant conduire au développement de douleurs chroniques. Ces effets ne feraient que mimer ce que font les opioïdes endogènes eux-mêmes lorsqu'ils sont mis en jeu lors de stress environnementaux menaçant la survie de l'individu. Cette hypersensibilité induite par les substances opioïdes exogènes ou endogènes n'est pas limitée à la sensation douloureuse mais rend compte également de la vulnérabilité induite de la sphère émotionnelle comme il en est de l'anxiété par exemple. En raison de mécanismes différents de ceux de la nociception, l'hypersensibilité à la douleur ne peut être réduite par des antalgiques classiques (antinociceptifs) et requiert des thérapies spécifiques dites d'antisensibilisation, telles que les antagonistes NMDA, le protoxyde d'azote, le néfopam ou les régimes alimentaires pauvres en polyamines, capables de moduler négativement (sans les bloquer) les récepteurs NMDA.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

One way of thinking about the relationship between anxiety and panic that may help clarify the relationship between overall anxiety levels and the frequency of panic attacks is an interactive model. The greater the background level of anxiety, whether related to acute or chronic situational anxiety or to life stress or marked anticipatory anxiety, the greater the frequency of panic attacks. Some drugs may actually block anxiety, while other drugs may reduce anxiety and work more indirectly by reducing the frequency or threshold for paroxysmal or chronic discharges from the locus coeruleus or similar or interrelated structures. Agoraphobia with panic attacks is an anxiety syndrome complicated frequently by the presence of depression. Compared to depression, pathological anxiety is an emotional state that has received little attention in the field of psychiatric research, despite its more frequent occurrence.",

In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

The insight that depressions, above all masked depressions can be the basis of many psychosomatic symptoms in obstetrics and gynecology paves the way for good therapeutic possibilities in many cases that have been resistant to therapy heretofore. Antidepressants often bring prompt relief from symptoms. Psychotherapy is possible in numerous cases following success in prescribing antidepressants.",

A diagnosis of depressive disorder depends on the underlying cause, and on the nature, severity and duration of symptoms. Management involves accurate diagnosis and treatment of medical illness, practical interventions to resolve concurrent family, social and economic stressors, and emotional support. Cognitive, behavioral and brief psychodynamic therapies may be helpful in selected cases. Antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have a role in the treatment of severe or persistent depression associated with suicidal behavior, marked psychomotor retardation, starvation or other life-threatening symptoms. Suicidal thoughts are frequent in older patients with concurrent major depression and chronic illness, and measures to ensure patient safety are a priority.",

Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine. Elle se manifeste surtout dans les domaines où les effets de la maladie et des traitements pèsent lourdement sur les patients et les cliniciens et où les enjeux sont existentiels. L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient.

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity.

      "abstract": "Chronic pain, which is widespread worldwide, has negative physical and psychological effects and can cause serious decreases in quality of life. There are various types of chronic pain such as musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, head-facial pain and it is caused by different factors. However, it is one of the issues that should be taken into consideration that chronic pain that manifests itself on the body is not only caused by biological reasons, but may also have a psychological background. In this context, there is a lot of evidence that psychological trauma plays an important role in the onset of chronic pain by increasing pain sensitivity and severity. In the light of this information, how different types of trauma such as ‘psychological trauma’, ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’, ‘childhood traumas’ affect chronic pain has been mentioned in detail. In addition, emotional factors also play a role in chronic pain, and even pain and emotions share a common neurobiology. Research findings on how the relationship between different types of emotions and chronic pain has been revealed. In the literature, there are many studies on the connection of emotions and psychological trauma history with the body. However, especially in Turkey, studies examining these variables in chronic pain are insufficient and it is thought that more research is needed. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to review the existing theories and research on the relationship between chronic pain, trauma and emotions.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

      "abstract": "Despite the feet that anxiety is today a focus of attention and that anxiety states merit a special heading in the classifications of mental diseases DSM-III and ICD-10, the concept of anxiety, strange as it may seem, has not yet been clearly defined. Even the very word anxiety varies from one language to another [1]. In the scientific literature, anxiety is understood to refer to an emotional state and a personality trait (in Russian, the term trevozhnost ' is used for this), a set of autonomic and endocrine responses, and the affective component of a stress reaction. Normal anxiety is a natural, adaptive response to a potentially threatening situation; but psychiatrists basically are confronted with pathological anxiety. This concept is also inadequately defined: an anxiety that is too intense or prolonged to fit the event causing it is usually called pathological. There is no doubt that anxiety occurring spontaneously, without an actual stress situation, is pathological. Hormonal disorders, e.g., pheochromocytoma or hyperthyroidism, are relatively rare causes of such anxiety. However, in most cases",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "abstract": "Pain is, according to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, an unpleasant, sensory and emotional experience connected to real or possible tissue damage or descriptively in terms of damage. Pain is the most expressed symptom of every clinical picture of oral cavity disease and the reason for the patient to contact his dentist. The feeling of pain is individual, difficult to compare and measure. Depending on the time of its occurence, pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is fast and sharp, it occurs during stimulus application or immediately after the stimulus has been removed. Chronic pain is dull, slow, it appears intermittently or continually, it can be dependent on the stimulus or spontaneous. It presents more character variations than the acute pain. Such patients often come to the dentist's office, complaining about the pain which is not present at that moment. This makes diagnostics harder and widens the spectrum of pathological changes which may cause such pain. Various dental surgeries can cause painful sensations of different character, intensities and duration. It is necessary to diagnose painful sensations and to remove the cause. Prosthetic therapy can cause physical pain in many clinical phases, however, physical pain is also connected to prosthetic rehabilitation due to disrupted chewing, phonetic and aesthetic function which is ensured by a healthy and sanitized stomatognathic system. The fear of uncertainty of functioning and aesthetics without prosthetic work during the therapy implementation and the fear and uncertainty of the new prosthetic work has great effect on the patient's behaviour. The 'new' smile changes the patient's facial appearance. One becomes aware of that and engages himself in conversation with others more confidently. Properly performed prosthetic therapy raises self-confidence of a patient and can open up new opportunities in life. This is achieved by a therapist who can correctly and individually indicate prosthetic work and recognize the personality of a patient and thus adapt the way of communication during therapy. A dentist should not fear painful sensations that a patient complains about, but using his knowledge make the correct diagnosis, recognise his possible mistake at work and as fast and as more efficiently as possible reduce the feeling of pain.",

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence in the United States, with an estimated incidence exceeding 1 million injuries per year. Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

What is depression, then, in modern medicine? A disease with a strictly defined biological aetiology, a condition with an established psychopathological image and neurophysiological pathomechanisms, a condition qualitatively distinct from health or, rather, a complex reaction to broadly defined stress, accumulation of negative emotions and weakening of the body’s vitality?

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are more prevalent than any other mental health problem in the USA, but afflicted patients are often untreated or treated only by a primary care physician. Anxiety disorders can be understood in the context of the interplay of biological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. Psychiatry has defined effective treatment that integrates education, psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. A combination of treatment approaches may be beneficial. Anxiety related symptoms, other than a true anxiety disorder, may be precipitated by normal stresses of daily life. These patients may also benefit from treatments used in anxiety disorders. Anxiety can also occur secondary to medical disorders and medications, as well as being present as part of other psychiatric syndromes. Diagnosis requires a history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Anxiety disorders, although common, are easily overlooked because patients may present with somatic complaints rather than admit to having emotional problems. Anxiety disorders are divided into seven categories in DSM IV, with each allowing for a differential treatment approach. Non-pharmacological treatments are the first line of treatment, and may include behavior therapy and cognitive therapy. The physician-patient relationship is itself a powerful treatment tool. Key areas in which the psychiatrist can help the patient cope are outlined. Benefits and risks of drug treatment for anxiety disorders are discussed.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

Jackson's observations that brain lesions could cause \"uncinate fits\" or the focal motor seizures which later bore his name also led him to consider seizure classifications based upon anatomical and pathological issues in addition to clinical phenomenology. Confusing epileptic seizures with the condition of epilepsy has fostered imprecise terminology and clinical inexactitudes. Seizures are discrete epileptic events, the manifestations of transient, hypersynchronous, abnormal neuronal behavior. The initial events of a seizure, either described by the patient or an observer, are usually the most reliable clinical indication of whether a seizure begins focally or is generalized from the beginning.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

      "title": "Reactions to stressful experiences",
      "abstract": "In biological terms, stress literally means a force from the outside world acting upon an individual, and is a phenomenon we have all experienced. The term ‘stress’ was first used in the 1930s by the endocrin­ologist Hans Selye to describe the responses of la­boratory animals to various stimuli. Originally, Selye meant ‘stress’ to be the response of an organism to a perceived threat or ‘stressor’, but the term is now used to mean the stimulus rather than the response in some cases. When presented with a stressor of any type, everyone will produce a reaction to that stress, and this is a normal physiological event. However, if the reac­tion is prolonged, too intense, or atypical in some way, stress can become abnormal and cause problems. Stressful events, even when reacted to normally, are important contributors to the causes of many kinds of psychiatric disorder. In this chapter, we consider those psychiatric disorders that are specific reactions to stressful experiences. These may occur independently or alongside other psychiatric conditions and include: … ● acute stress reactions: short- term disorders after stressful events; ● post- traumatic stress disorder: a disorder following exceptionally severe stress; ● adjustment disorders: conditions occurring after a change in life circumstances; ● grief reactions: the normal and abnormal responses to bereavement; ● reactions to special kinds of acute stress: for example, traffic accidents, war, earthquakes, etc… For all these conditions, an identifiable stressor is a necessary but not always sufficient factor in its aetiology. GPs encounter the vast majority of patients with stress disorders who present to the health services, but all clinicians will see these patients in their clinical specialties. The reasons for this are threefold: … 1 Acute physical illness and its treatment are stressful. 2 Chronic illness or disability can result in substantial changes in life circumstances. 3 Clinicians treat people involved in other kinds of stressful experiences…. Everyone reacts to stress differently, and what consti­tutes a stressful event is therefore highly subjective. However, there are certain situations that are likely to be experienced as stressful by anyone. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is a list of 43 life events which predispose to stress- related illnesses, weighted ac­cording to their respective probability of doing so.",

      "abstract": "Central poststroke pain (CPSP), formerly known as thalamic pain syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy, is a central neuropathic pain occurring in patients affected by stroke. It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

The causes of amputation include trauma, infection, diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and other diseases. The impact of amputation on psychological situation and social and family relationships is undeniable, because physical disability also affects one’s social and mental health, in addition to his/her psychological adaptation and compared to the ordinary people, these people are suffering more from social isolation. Therefore, any limb amputation not only is considered as a physical injury but is also followed by psychological- emotional damages.",

Although it may cause no great difficulty or social handicap in everyday life compared to social phobia, agoraphobia or other simple phobias, it can have grave implications and may even become life-threatening when it prevents essential medical procedures. Unfortunately, not many of its sufferers come for treatment until circumstances require urgent attention. Yet, it can be effectively treated behaviourally by modeling and exposure therapy. Two cases of this fascinating condition are described.",

Anxiety may also mask primary psychiatric disorders such as depression or delirium. Therapy requires treating any underlying psychiatric illness and seeking psychosocial intervention for functional causes.

They are less commonly diagnosed than migraine, their pathophysiology is poorly understood, and evidence for their treatment is mostly anecdotal. Importantly, however, although considered primary headaches after a period of observation, many can present, at least initially, as manifestations of other conditions. Whereas headaches such as primary stabbing headache and hypnic headache are primary in most instances, others, such as those attributed to exercise or sexual activity or thunderclap headache, may present acutely in an emergency department setting, in which imaging and other testing may be appropriate to rule out secondary causes.",

The symptoms are recognized for what they are and respond rapidly to reassurance, mild sedation, and effective treatment of the obvious disease or injury. On the other hand, many patients come with anxiety of more obscure cause. It may manifest itself as fatigue, nervousness, tenseness, headache, insomnia, indigestion, or a host of other symptoms.

      "abstract": "يعتبر  القلق من الأمراض العصابية الشائعة إلا أنه يعتبر أيضا سمة رئيسية في معظم الاضطرابات ، نجده بين الأسوياء في مواقف الأزمات کما نجده مصاحبا لکل الأمراض العصابية والذهانية على حد سواء ، و القلق هو سمة العصر الحديث  بأزماته وطموحاته ومنافساته الحادة وقد يکون هذا صحيحا لکن مع هذا نجد أن الحالات الشديدة من القلق توجد في کافة المجتمعات ولم يخل منها عصر من العصور ، ويعد القلق خبرة انفعالية غير سارة يعاني منها الفرد عندما يشعر بخوف أو تهديد من شيء  دون أن يستطيع تحديده تحديدا واضحا، وغالبا ما تصاحب هذه الحالة بعض التغيرات الفسيولوجية                   ( عسيري ،2007 : 1 ) وقد عرفه ( زهران ، 2005 : 484 ) بأنه حالة توتر شامل ومستمر نتيجة توقع تهديد خطر فعلي أو رمزي قد يحدث ، ويصاحبها أعراض نفسية جسمية ، وکأن لسان حاله يقول شاعر بمصيبة قادمة . ويمکننا القول إن قليلا من القلق لا بأس فيه لأنه يحضر الإنسان لمواجهة الحياة اليومية ويجعله مستعدا بشکل أفضل لدرء المخاطر و اتقان تصرفاته و أعماله المتنوعة ..والحياة اليومية تواجهنا بمواقف کثيرة تتطلب الجهد والرد الصحيح ، والقلق باعث إيجابي للتکيف مع الواقع ومتطلباته .. وتکمن المشکلة عند زيادة کمية القلق أو استمراره فترة طويلة .. وهنا يعتبر القلق مرضا واضطرابا .. لأنه يعطل الإنسان ويرهقه ويجعل حياته اليومية مؤلمة ومزعجة .. ويجعل أعصابه مشدودة ومتوترة ..کما أن الإحساس بالقلق والترقب فترة طويلة يؤدي إلى المزاج السيئ والإرهاق واستنزاف الطاقة ونقص الإنتاجية                  ( المالح ، 1997: 2 ) .وإذا تمثل هذا القلق في  خلل واضطراب نفسي المنشأ ناجم  عن خبرات ماضية غير سارة مع تشويه وتحريف إدراکي معرفي للواقع وللذات من خلال استحضار للذکريات والخبرات الماضية غير السارة ، مع تضخيم للسلبيات ودحض للإيجابيات الخاصة بالذات والواقع يجعل صاحبه في حالة من التوتر وعدم الأمن مما يدفعه لتدمير الذات والعجز الواضح وتعميم الفشل وتوقع الکوارث ، وتؤدي به إلى حالة من التشاؤم من المستقبل وقلق التفکير في المستقبل والخوف من المشکلات الاجتماعية والاقتصادية المستقبلية المتوقعة والأفکار الوسواسية وقلق الموت واليأس ، فإنه يعرف بقلق المستقبل ( شقير، 2005 :5 ) ، والذي يعد من المشکلات النفسية الهامة التي تواجه الطلبة ، لما يواجهونه من ضغوط ناتجة عن تخوفهم من المستقبل وبالتالي أصبح التفکير والخوف من المستقبل من الأمور لتي تشغل بال أو فکر الطلبة فهم المستقبل ويفکرون في المستقبل ويتخوفون مما يخبأه لهم وقد ذکر (محمود، 2003 : 34 ) أن بعض الدراسات العربية الحديثة تناولت مفهوم قلق المستقبل ويعد هذا المفهوم وثيق الصلة بمفهوم التوجه نحو المستقبل فهما على طرفي متصل واحد فبقدر ما يکون قلق المستقبل حافزا على الإنجاز فإنه يقترب من التوجه نحو المستقبل وبقدر ما ينخفض مستوى التوجه نحو المستقبل لدى  الفرد فإنه يعبر عن قلقه من هذا المستقبل ودفاعه ضد هذا القلق بالإغراق في الحاضر ( في فراج ،2006 ). وسوف يعرف الباحث الحالي قلق المستقبل بالدرجة التي يحصل عليها الطالب في مقياس قلق المستقبل ، وفق مقياس غالب المشيخي  .        أن نجاح الطالب في المستقبل قائم على قدرته على بناء رؤى واضحة وأهداف محددة  تحفزه على بذل المزيد من الجهد في التحصيل الدراسي والذي  يعتبر محکا أساسيا للحکم على مدى ما يمکن أن يحصله الطالب في المستقبل ، کما أنه يعتبر بمثابة المحصلة لعدد من العوامل المرتبطة بالدافعية والظروف البيئية والنفسية والمزاجية ، وهذا يتطلب استقرارا نفسيا  حتى يتحقق له ذلک  ، فقد   أشارت الدراسات التي أجراها الباحثون في علم النفس أن الطالب المضطرب انفعاليا أو الذي يعاني من القلق أو عدم وجود الأمن والطمأنينة يصبح غير قادر على الترکيز والاستيعاب، فهو مشتت الفکر وبالتالي ينخفض مستوى تحصيله الدراسي والتحصيل الدراسي کما يعرفه أحد الباحثين هو ما يتعلمه الفرد من معلومات خلال دراسته وما يدرکه من علاقات بين هذه المعلومات وما يستنبطه فيها من حقائق تنعکس في أداء المتعلم على اختبار يوضع وفق  قواعد تمکن من تقدير أداء المتعلم تقديرا کميا وهو ما يسمى بدرجات التحصيل ( الحامد ، 1996: 1 ).       وقد أشارت الدراسات إلى إن هناک عوامل أخرى تؤثر على التحصيل الدراسي، مثل المستوى الاقتصادي والاجتماعي لأسرة الطالب ، ومنها دراسة حنين والتي أشارت لوجود ارتباط بين المستوى الاقتصادي للأسرة والتحصيل الدراسي ( في الثبيتي،1409: 19  )، ودراسة کريشنان التي أظهرت نتائجها أن هناک ارتباطا ذا دلالة إحصائية  بين المستوى الاجتماعي والاقتصادي والتحصيل الدراسي (في  الحازمي ، 1410: 58 ) ، وقد أوضحت دراسة قام بها کابلي أن هناک علاقة ارتباطية طردية موجبة بين دخل الأسرة الشهري والتحصيل الدراسي ( في الحازمي ، 1410 :60 ) إلا أننا نجد أن سمة القلق من المستقبل ومستوياته تتفاوت بين طالب وآخر، وفق مدى تفهم الطالب للمادة الدراسية ومدى استعداده للاختبار بالإضافة إلى نوعية التخصص ، کما أشارت بعض الدراسات التي أجريت بهدف التعرف على علاقة قلق المستقبل بالتخصص کدراسة (السبعاوي ، 2007 ) والتي أظهرت وجود علاقة ارتباطية غير دالة بين متغير قلق المستقبل ومتغير التخصص لصالح التخصص العلمي  وهذا ينعکس على أدائه في تحصيله الدراسي ، الذي يعد أکثر المفاهيم النفسية التربوية ترکيبا أو تعقيدا ، نظرا لاشتراک العديد من العوامل والعمليات المدرسية والمحلية والاجتماعية في إنتاجه ، وبالتالي فهو يعرف وفق مفهومين رئيسين هما : أ‌-   التحصيل نفسيا کنتيجة للتعلم : حيث يعد التحصيل والتعلم وجهان لعملة واحدة کلما حدث أحدهما نفترض تلقائيا حدوث الآخر لا محالة في الأحوال العادية للدماغ الإنساني ، وهو نتيجة مباشرة للتعلم ب‌-   التحصيل بيئيا کنتيجة مدرسية : وهو المعارف والمهارات والميول والملاحظة لدى الدارسين لعملية التعلم ( حمدان ، 1417 : 4 )  وسوف يعرفه الباحث الحالي بأنه مجموع الدرجات التي سوف يحصل عليها الطالب في الفصل الدراسي الأول للعام الدراسي 1430 -1431 هـ",

This is true whether one observes the direct evidence of abnormal function or the compensatory reactions invoked to counteract abnormal forces. The central nervous system is no exception to this principle. And this is no less true whether one deals with disease directly involving the central nervous system or with the effects on it of disease having its origin elsewhere. This report is concerned with secondary effects. Neuropsychiatric complications of underlying disease may vary widely from mild aberrations of normal mood and behavior to sweeping disturbances that dominate the entire clinical picture and may obscure the disease itself. The basis for these reactions depends primarily on the fundamental nature of brain metabolism. The central nervous system has the most exacting metabolic requirements in the body.

      "title": "Depression: epidemic or pseudo-epidemic?",
      "abstract": "There are a number of under-examined fault lines running through the medical literature on depression, and current clinical practice in the UK. This chiefly stems from a too exclusively biomedical focus, neglecting the social construction of the human mind. For a start, the term `depression' tends to be used without qualification, as if it was settled that we were always referring to a free-standing biologically-based disorder. Yet in everyday usage, as much by doctors as by the general public, `depression' can mean something figurative or literal, can denote a normal or abnormal state, and if abnormal either an individual symptom or a full-blown disorder. And though depression-as-disease may have acquired the status of a natural science category, this was an achievement rather than a discovery: the history of the concept demonstrates the gradual incorporation of a Western cultural vocabulary of guilt, energy, fatigue and stress.1\r\n\r\nOrthodox teaching has been that a `functional shift', the presence of so-called biological features, points to medically significant depression (and responsiveness to anti-depressants). But, bar a small subset of severe cases, there is no reliable demarcation of depression from ordinary unhappiness or misery on this basis. Poor sleep and concentration, weight loss, reduced motivation and drive, anhedonia, etc. (as well as suicidal ideas), not uncommonly accompany ordinary misery as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, just before the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners began a Defeat Depression campaign, they surveyed lay people's attitudes to depression and its treatment.2 The views they elicited tended to portray depression in terms of emotional problems, like unhappiness, caused primarily by social and situational factors, and not something to take to general practitioners (GPs). Of the 2003 people polled, 78% saw anti-depressants as addictive, and liable to dull symptoms rather than solve the problem. The Royal Colleges seem to have been undeterred by these findings, which were rather at odds with their view of `depression' as straightforwardly connoting a psychiatric disorder. Indeed the Royal Colleges initiated the Defeat Depression campaign because they believed that 50% of people with depression did not consult their GPs. They wanted to increase this figure. But was the lay view wrong? We can see here how professional pronouncements can contribute to a blurring between unpleasant but commonplace mental states, part of life, and those associated with objective dysfunction and breakdown, meriting medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe other explicitly stated reason for the campaign was the belief that GPs often missed depression anyway. Since then the notion that there were large numbers of undiagnosed cases has been remarkably tenacious. Why? There is, in fact, no sound evidence for an epidemic of depression (as psychiatric disorder) in the UK. On the other hand, the case for an epidemic of antidepressant prescribing is now cast iron. In Britain prescriptions rose from 9 million to 21 million during the 1990s, and in the USA have doubled in only 5 years—mirroring the production and marketing of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants.\r\n\r\nWhat remains striking is how unrobust the evidence base for antidepressants still is, particularly for the mild/moderate cases that account for the majority of all prescriptions.3 Part of the reason is surely that antidepressants will not cure human misery, whether presenting in primary care or in psychiatric clinics. Indeed many of those difficult cases described in psychiatric journals as having `treatment resistant depression' may be `resistant' precisely for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this repeatedly aired assumption about under-recognition at primary care level has itself led GPs to prescribe more readily. Further, some GPs prescribe for low mood per se, even if other features of the syndrome are absent, and the simpler dose regimens of SSRIs by comparison with tricyclics have helped. Patient feedback is influenced by placebo effects, and by factors like nonspecific sedation that have nothing to do with `antidepression'. People whose record indicates prior prescription of anti-depressants are more likely to be prescribed them again at a later time by other doctors. It remains to be seen if NICE guidelines—which do not recommend antidepressants as the primary intervention in `mild/moderate' cases, make a difference to these trends.4\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical promotion of SSRIs made much of the claim to have fewer side-effects than the tricyclics, and this contributed to the confidence with which GPs recommended them to patients. In view of the public concern about addictive effects evident in the survey described above, it is ironic that discontinuation reactions are now emerging as a distinct clinical problem (extending to litigation against doctors in the USA), both in SSRIs and in other new anti-depressants like venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nThe weak construct validity of psychiatric categories, and the dominance of empiricism over theoretical development, are overarching issues for the psychiatric profession.5 Both are apparent in the discourse about depression. So, too, is a lack of explicit reflection on the ideological and societally-framed nature of medical practice, which would need to take account of cultural shifts in attitudes to adversity and the emergence of an expressive, less stoical individualism.6 The surge in anti-depressant prescribing is as much a cultural trend as a medical one, reflecting the rise of a medicalization and professionalization of everyday life and its problems across Western societies.7\r\n\r\nThere is also an important international dimension. `Depression' is said to contribute 12% of the total burden of nonfatal global disease.8 The World Health Organization describes it as an epidemic that within two decades will be second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of global disease burden. But `depression' has no exact equivalent in non-Western cultures, not least because these do not share a Western ethnopsychology that defines `emotion' as internal, often biological, unintentioned, distinct from cognition, and a feature of individuals rather than situations.9 Non-Western peoples would tend to see the problem in situational and moral terms (as some Western citizens still do, as evidenced by the survey described above), though when they migrate to the West they become more likely to ascribe to a depression-as-disease model.10 This is to highlight the work of culture and its opinion formers—including the medical profession—in shaping a particular interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Western-derived quantitative instruments to estimate population prevalences worldwide is likely to commit a category fallacy, which is the assumption that mental and bodily state phenomena mean the same thing in whatever setting they are detected. There is no such thing as depression, if by this we mean (as the WHO appear to mean) a unitary, universally valid, pathological entity requiring medical intervention. Such claims seem a serious distortion, one serving to deflect attention away from what millions of people might cite as the basis of their misery, like poverty and lack of rights. The one clear-cut beneficiary would be the pharmaceutical industry, with its vested interest in the biologization of the human predicament.",

      "title": "Ansiedad y depresión: el problema de la diferenciación a través de los síntomas",
      "abstract": "El problema de la diferenciacion de los sintomas entre ansiedad y depresion, constituye una de las grandes preocupaciones en la psicopatologia, dadas las profundas implicaciones para las tareas diagnosticas y de intervencion. La problematica referida anteriormente se ve reflejada en los datos de vigilancia epidemiologica, segun los cuales se indica una fuerte comorbilidad entre ambos tipos de trastorno, sin que llegue a establecerse con precision cual antecede o predispone al otro, o si se trata de una confusion entre ambos trastornos, dada la presencia de sintomas comunes. Este ultimo hecho se hace mas evidente cuando se considera que muchos de los sintomas tradicionalmente atribuidos a la ansiedad, tambien se presentan en la depresion y viceversa, asi como los casos en los que algunos sintomas pueden llegar a constituirse en cuadros clinicos completos. Ante el panorama anterior, surge la inquietud por la identificacion de las caracteristicas de los trastornos de ansiedad frente a los trastornos del estado de animo, entre ellos el trastorno de la depresion; mas aun , desde que en los manuales diagnosticos vigentes ambos tipos de trastornos se encuentran plenamente descritos, aunque la diferenciacion clinica, al comparar los criterios, sea verdaderamente critica. Una posible explicacion al solapamiento de los sintomas entre ansiedad y depresion (para referirse de manera general a ambos tipos de trastorno), ha sido clasicamente atribuida a comorbilidad, es decir a la presencia coexistente de ambos cuadros en muchos de los casos clinicos. Sin embargo, esta explicacion circular no deja del todo satisfechos ni a los clinicos ni a los investigadores. Por otro lado, dicha concurrencia de sintomas se atribuye a un asunto de instrumentos de evaluacion. Asi, se plantea como los trastornos dependen de las herramientas con que se midan, las cuales siguen un modelo teorico explicativo acerca de la etiologia, el curso, el pronostico y la sintomatologia asociada. De esta forma, los instrumentos tienen un sesgo implicito en cuanto a que privilegian un aspecto especifico en funcion de como se definen los trastornos, y dejan muchas veces por fuera otros aspectos tambien definitorios. De acuerdo con lo anterior y en relacion directa con la depresion, el presente estudio indica que la evaluacion se caracteriza por la multiplicidad de instrumentos disenados para este fin, asi como por la diversidad de contenidos que evaluan, de tal forma que se hace dificil establecer los sintomas caracteristicos cuando pocos sintomas coinciden a traves de las distintas herramientas de evaluacion. En la misma linea, se indica como las instrucciones dadas a los sujetos para responder a los cuestionarios, suelen confundir medidas de frecuencia con medidas de gravedad; esto nos lleva a la discusion clasica, acerca del caracter dimensional frente al caracter categorial de la depresion. Una alternativa explicativa de la presencia de sintomas compartidos entre ansiedad y depresion, se encuentra en el planteamiento de la existencia de un factor de afectividad negativa, compartido por ambos tipos de trastornos, de tal forma que en este nucleo se agruparian los sintomas que suelen ser comunes, mientras que habria otro componente especifico de la ansiedad que se refiere a la activacion fisiologica y un componente especifico, para la depresion, en relacion a la baja afectividad positiva. Asi, la ansiedad se definiria en funcion de una alta afectividad negativa y una alta activacion fisiologica (arousal), mientras que la depresion se caracterizaria por una alta afectividad negativa y una baja afectividad positiva. De acuerdo con los elementos senalados, se insiste en la importancia de disponer de adecuadas y fiables herramientas de evaluacion que contribuyan a la identificacion precisa de los distintos trastornos, que aporten datos en apoyo de procesos de intervencion mas eficaces, para el decremento de los trastornos mentales y su incidencia dentro de la salud mental de las comunidades. En este sentido, Spielberger y cols. ofrecen un instrumento de evaluacion cuyo objetivo es diferenciar aspectos caracteristicos de la depresion mediante el uso de dos escalas diferenciadas (estado y rasgo), con lo que se intenta aportar elementos que ayudan a esclarecer el panorama del diagnostico clinico de la depresion.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3.

Even though physical and mental problems are important in the rehabilitation of such children, emotional and social factors also play a significant role at some time or another and in varying degrees in most handicapping conditions of childhood.",

      "abstract": "A PROGRESSION of peculiarities that may be as harmless as the faux pas of the absent-minded professor or as tragic as the deterioration of King Lear forms the spectrum of what in its fully developed form is called dementia. Simply defined, it is intellectual disintegration. The manifestations of dementia vary considerably, reflecting the mental, social, and emotional resources of a person before his illness began. Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure. Thus, a frequent early complaint is that the patient is",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

It is frequently difficult to adequately diagnose this disorder, above all, when the faked symptoms are those of a psychological or a psychiatric disorder. In these cases, there is often high comorbidity with other mental disorders, thus making it difficult to differentiate between real and factitious symptoms. Moreover, the lack of clear objective markers makes assessing the diagnosis even more difficult. In this article, we have aimed to clarify how a correct diagnosis of factitious disorder with psychological symptoms can be reached, to observe the different therapeutic strategies described in the literature and to analyze the utility of each one of them in a given case report.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

The classical characteristics of psychosis are impaired reality testing, hallucinations, delusions, and illusions. While factitious disorder and malingering are usually acknowledged as contrived psychiatric conditions for acquisition of interior or exterior profits, respectively, another alternative, also, exists that though is not manufactured individually, is enforced peripherally. Such cases, which are usually referred by the judge’s ruling, for evaluation and treatment, are more important than comparable simulated or genuine mental conditions, because incorrect diagnosis, or careless, cagily, and guarded validation of preliminary diagnosis that has been issued in the authorized or emergency department, can seriously endanger the individual’s civil rights, while it should not be overlooked that incorrect diagnosis is a kind of malpractice that may harm an individual awfully.

The clinical differentiation between functional and organic disease is at times difficult to establish, because, presumptively, in the beginning, at least, all organic disease is preceded by a physiologic perversion, that is, functional alteration, which may or may not be apparent with our present diagnostic limitations. Likewise, many conditions cause disturbance of rate or rhythm, the exact mode of production not always known, which, though hardly distinguishable from the symptoms of emotional or vasomotor instability, should as a rule not be classified as functional states in a restricted",

Patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the main symptom of which is a persistent, free-floating fear over a period of at least several months, may be helped through relaxation techniques, counseling and/or medication with low doses of sedating tricyclic compounds or short-term treatment with benzodiazepines.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

You don't need to think about the cause, which is fortunate, as we don't know it. Another set of symptoms and a different set of tick boxes, and then this is depression. Again, the label says nothing about the cause, which is also fortunate, as it may have been anything from a long list of psychological, social, or physical hazards.\n\nAnother set of tick boxes and the label might be post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, this time the label does indeed specify the cause: trauma. Out go the intricacies of psychiatric formulation—the complex interplay of genes, early environment, education, marriage, life events, physical illness, and so on. Here was something simple. The appearance of the new diagnosis of PTSD in 1980 was part of America's attempts to come to terms with …",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "title": "Chronic pain, psychopathology, and DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder.",
      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

The long-term management of head injury and Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) commonly rests with the family and occurs with little or no assistance from the medical or paramedical services.

In psychiatry, in the community has been widely reported (), mainly related to legal psychiatry (getting some social benefits, avoiding legal obligations, etc). From forensic psychiatry, this topic have a special relevance as they have more serious consequences (to avoid prison, child custody, etc)(Resnick 2003, Gunn 2014). Another topic of paramount importance is that in psychiatry we have not complementary examinations (RMN, TAC, blood tests, etc) that help to discard some symptoms. Some test are used for detecting feigned symptoms as SIMS, The most important psychological episodes in prison are those related to disruptive / bizarre behaviour, suicide ideation and psychotic symptoms that create a great nuisance to Prison Governors. To get an accurate diagnosis is very important because this could have a psychiatric approach or a prison sanction. Sometimes a previous feigned symptom does not mean to have new episode with psychiatric symptomatology that should be treated.

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

It is a motor or movement disorder causing bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural hypotension. Care home residents with diabetes have more cardiovascular disease, visual problems, pressure sores, limb amputations and kidney failure than residents without diabetes.

Conditions of the workplace have been shown to lead to negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety), physical health problems in both the short term (e.g., headache or stomach distress) and the long term (cardiovascular disease), and counterproductive behavior at work. Perceptions of control play an important role in this process, being associated with all of these variables. Evidence is growing that enhanced control at work can be an important element in employees' health and well–being. These relationships can be understood in the context of the control–stress model.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

The words dizzy, giddy and vertiginous from a patient do not really mean different things - they only mean: I feel unbalanced or disequilibrated. In the anamnesis it is much more important to find out firstly whether the disturbances are: (1) paroxysmal; (2) one acute attack; (3) chronic, (4) positional (positioning), and secondly whether the giddy feeling is accompanied by other disturbances (deafness, headache, pains, palsies, etc.). Some tables are presented that give a survey of the combination of some of these data and that facilitate the further examination towards the goal of the right diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Deaths occurring in police custody frequently raise public suspicion and concern, often prompting allegations of abuse or misconduct. Such cases attract intense scrutiny, necessitating thorough forensic investigation to establish the true cause of death. However, not all custodial deaths result from physical trauma or foul play; some may be attributed to natural causes, including undiagnosed or unmanaged medical conditions. This case study focuses on the sudden demise of a 57-year-old male detainee who succumbed to an intracerebral haemorrhage while in custody. The individual had a known history of long-standing hypertension, a condition that significantly increases the risk of spontaneous brain haemorrhage. Despite initial concerns about possible custodial violence, a comprehensive medico-legal autopsy and detailed histopathological examination revealed no signs of external or internal injuries suggestive of trauma or assault. Instead, the findings conclusively pointed to a natural death due to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease. This case underscores the critical role of forensic pathology in differentiating between natural and unnatural causes of death in custodial settings. It also reinforces the importance of objective scientific investigation to uphold justice, ensure institutional accountability, and maintain public trust in the medico-legal process. Clear, evidence-based conclusions are essential for addressing public concerns and safeguarding the rights of both the deceased and the custodial authorities.",

They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one. In spite of thorough investigation, there will remain a proportion of patients in whom no lesion can be found to account for their symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is often confused with elevations of anxiety and what is often described as \"anxiety attacks.\" However, panic is qualitatively different from these phenomena. Panic disorders or panic attacks are intense and usually brief episodes that have often come upon the sufferer as an extreme dread and fear of annihilation. Panic attacks are startling and often produce a sense of impending doom and fear of imminent disaster. They are associated with heart palpitations, dizziness, tingling of extremities, disorientation, and the urge to flee the present environment. During a panic attack, it is not unusual for the sufferer to act in ways that seem completely irrational and beyond the realm of sanity. Imagine sitting quietly in a darkened room and being intensely engrossed in a book that you cannot put down. Suddenly you feel someone's hands grasp your neck and begin choking you. That level of startled and life-threatening fear is like what many report during a panic attack. It is difficult to know what causes this disorder. In many cases, sufferers report having endured traumatic experiences, especially in childhood. However, in an equal percentage of cases, there is no prior trauma history, and the origins of the panic disorder are unknown, although they do tend to run in families. This book elucidates the nature of panic, the factors that contribute to the disorder, and describes psychological, physiological, and medical interventions that have been useful in ameliorating the suffering brought on by panic attacks.",

Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

      "abstract": "People react to illness in a manner that reflects a complex and evolving interaction of several factors. Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

      "abstract": "The term psychogenic pain has been applied to pain conditions, including specific chronic orofacial states, that present without an adequate pathophysiologic basis to account for the pain. The position taken in this focus article is that the concept of psychogenic pain can be provocative and heuristic for research but that its use in clinical settings is highly problematic. Moreover, although the concept of psychogenic pain is provocative, the term psychogenic pain reinforces a dualistic notion about pain, as either psychogenic or not, that is contrary to current biopsychosocial models of pain. Based on such a model of pain, findings from neurophysiologic and psychologic research are incorporated into a discussion of issues central to the problem, including whether or not pain can arise in the absence of any pathophysiologic signals, indeed, in the absence of any observable physical signal, pathologic or otherwise. Finally, the suggestion is offered that current knowledge has led to a blurring of the boundaries between physical and psychological processes. Attempts to search for the biogenic versus psychogenic etiology of pain symptoms can only be unsatisfying and unproductive.",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain. Treatment takes into account the aforementioned risk factors, plus interventions appropriate to the malfunctioning system.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders specifically associated with stress are exceptional in requiring external events as causes of psychiatric symptoms in order to arrive at a diagnosis. The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Functional disorders are clinical entities corresponding to complaints mimicking diseases without a clearly identified organic substrate despite a rigorous history and clinical examination. Sometimes, complementary examinations are necessary to rule out an organic lesion that could explain the symptomatology. The notion of a diagnosis of exclusion is therefore very present. The physician must constantly re-evaluate the diagnosis of functional disorder in order not to «miss» a diagnosis with an organic cause.The treatment of these functional disorders is sometimes based on psychological treatment when a psychogenic dimension seems to be involved. This is not always the case. In such cases it is necessary to be able to consider a placebo approach with the hope that the placebo effect may improve the patient's condition. This article discusses the placebo effect in functional disorders without omitting to address ethical and philosophical considerations.Les troubles fonctionnels sont des entités cliniques correspondant à des plaintes mimant des maladies sans substrat organique clairement identifié, malgré une anamnèse et un examen clinique rigoureux. Parfois, certains examens complémentaires sont nécessaires pour infirmer une lésion organique pouvant expliquer la symptomatologie. La notion de diagnostic d’exclusion est donc bien présente. Le praticien se doit de réévaluer sans cesse le diagnostic de trouble fonctionnel afin de ne pas «passer à côté» d’un diagnostic avec une cause organique. Le traitement de ces troubles fonctionnels repose parfois sur une prise en charge psychologique lorsqu’une dimension psychogène semble incriminée. Ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Il faut alors pouvoir être capable d’envisager une approche via des placebo en espérant que l’effet placebo puisse améliorer la condition du (de la) patient(e). Cet article décrit l’effet placebo dans les troubles fonctionnels, sans omettre d’aborder des notions éthiques et philosophiques.",

Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress.

Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis.

Method Analysis of the information from literature and practice and coming to conclusions with the inductive method. Results Social phobia is a chronicle illness, equally present in both sexes. The central position is taken by all-the-time present intense irrational fear. Alcoholism, misuse of sedatives, depression, and panic with agoraphobia, OCD are common followers of social phobia. Differential diagnosis witch eliminates panic with agoraphobia, or just the lack of social skills allows the right therapeutic approach.

      "abstract": "This chapter is primarily concerned with psychiatric issues in chronic pain. Most patients with a psychiatric disorder seen in a pain clinic will have had a preexisting psychiatric illness or will have developed mental illness because of their chronic painful illness. Depressive illness is the most common associated psychiatric disorder that is found in patients with chronic pain. The three most typical symptoms of a depressive illness are: depressed mood; loss of interest and pleasure; and loss of energy and increased fatigue. Anxiety disorders have been found to be correlated more closely than depression with chronic painful conditions in a large US sample of chronic pain patients. Panic disorder comprises severe unpredictable anxiety episodes that can occur \"out of the blue,\" although they are usually more common in one situation than another. The difficulty for the nonpsychiatric physician in examining a patient with long-standing pain is in differentiating distress from illness.",

The harms of an explosion would bring about a series of physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes to the different kinds of people that experienced the explosion, impacting their psychological health in different aspects. These impacts might exist only in the short term but could sustain for the long term and lead to serious psychological issues, stress disorder or adaptation disorder, or even psychological disorder. Serious cases might even suicide or hurt others. Therefore, carrying out psychological intervention and therapy in an effective and prompt manner has significant importance.",

      "abstract": "Background Headaches associated with physical exertion include headache precipitated by coughing or other Valsalva maneuvers, headache brought on by prolonged physical exercise, sexual headaches and cardiac cephalalgia. Objective To review and update the clinical characteristics, etiologies, pathophysiology and management of these headaches related to exertion. Methods In depth review of the publications, both in PubMed and in the main textbooks, of the different headaches induced by physical exercise. Results Cough, exercise and sexual headaches can be primary or secondary; therefore, complementary studies are mandatory to rule out structural lesions. However, clinical characteristics, such as an old age and response to indomethacin for cough headache or being a young male and response to beta-blockers for exercise and sexual headaches, plus a normal examination are suggestive of a primary etiology. Etiology for secondary varieties, as posterior fossa lesions for cough headache or vascular malformations for exercise and sexual headaches, are also different. Finally, headache as a distant manifestation of myocardial ischemia, also known as “cardiac cephalalgia”, appears at exertion in around two-thirds of cases and typically lasts less than 30 minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerine. Conclusions Primary and secondary cough headache can usually be suspected based on clinical characteristics and separated from exercise and sexual headaches, which share many aspects. Cardiac cephalalgia is not necessarily an exertional headache and should be considered in adult patients with short lasting headaches and patent vascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Acute pain hurts and most often is the result of tissue injury. Chronic pain also hurts. Although those who suffer from chronic pain also tend to associate the onset with an injury, illness, or surgical procedure; the root cause is far more complex. Chronic pain most often does not follow dermatomal distributions associated with any injury, disease or surgical procedure. And more often than not, chronic pain sufferers also suffer from various forms of depression and/or anxiety. The process of central sensitization resulting from tissue injury has been elucidated, as has many of the molecular changes within the brain that perpetuate chronic pain. Genetics, epigenetics, environmental stressors, and emotional stressors all play roles to varying degrees in the development of the chronic pain state. This article explores how synaptic memories form in the brain as a result of both physical and emotional traumas (multiple hits) resulting in progression to chronic pain, because of failure of the brain’s descending modulatory mechanisms to prevent or control “the pain.” This review contains 15 figures, and 178 references.

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

      "title": "The Transformation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: From Neurosis to Neurobiology",
      "abstract": "Lives can be severely disrupted after a momentous negative experience. Particularly potent are unexpected negative events, or “traumas,” such as a near death experience, a severe injury, or being exposed to intense interpersonal violence or a natural disaster. Although most people recover from these traumatic events, many do not, and experience persistent fear, anxiety and/or depression following the event. In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma. These gains from the study of memory and neurohormonal reactivity and control systems hold forth the promise of improved, biologically-informed, psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the future.",

      "abstract": "Most would agree that working in the fire/rescue, law enforcement and emergency medical services environment is exciting but stressful. Some of the issues that place people at a higher risk for developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) include: longer duration of the traumatic event; higher number of traumatic events; higher severity of the traumatic event, having little social support from family and friends. Also, children and adolescents, females, people with learning disabilities, or people who experience violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats. Such symptoms may gradually subside after a while; including chronic irritability, feelings of constantly being under threat, overeating, and alcohol abuse, perhaps dependency on tranquillizers or painkillers.",

Based on the discrepancy, the somatic symptoms with medically unexplained origins maintains, prolonged chronically, and grow up to FSS owing to various factors; physiological pathways, mood disturbance such as anxiety or depression, doctor-patient relationship, psychosocial stresses, alexithymia and alexisomia, and lack of support systems. As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "title": "Fear in Epilepsy: A Consideration of Its Nature and Significance",
      "abstract": "Fear, without content and unrelated to thought processes or somatic sensations has been observed in 40 cases of epilepsy. The paroxysmal nature of the fear and the relationship to the seizures have led to the conclusion that this fear is an aura. Other cases with fear as an aura have been cited from the literature. Clinical, electroencephalographic and pathological studies strongly suggest that this aura is a product of epileptic activity on either side; and that the localization of the focal activity producing the fear is situated in the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. Pertinent literature concerning the emotions, their anatomy and their nature, has been discussed. The aura when not commonly followed by a seizure may not be recognized as epileptic activity, and yet as epileptic activity it is not only amenable to treatment, but also may be symptomatic of a serious underlying pathology, neoplastic or vascular. Observations on the nature of fear in epilepsy have been made. The importance of consideration of the aura, fear, rests, not only in that the aura may not be recognized as epileptic activity, but also in that it affords an approach, along physical lines, to the study of at least one form of emotional activity in man. The emotions play such an important role in the realm of human behaviour and endeavour, yet knoweldge concerning their physical nature is still very limited.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic illness is a clinical concept used to define medically unexplained somatic symptoms considered to express psychological distress. Functional somatic illness may express underlying psychiatric disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia due to non-fearful panic disorder, irritable bowel syndrome due to bipolar disorder). Sustained physiological activation caused by stressful life events combined with catastrophic thinking may be another cause. Functional somatic illness may also be caused by classic conditioning of physiological responses that may have been triggered by biological or emotional stimuli. Operant conditioning may also be a cause. The therapeutic alliance relies on acceptance of the reality of the subjective complaints, without a priori acceptance of the patient's attribution of the cause of the symptoms. We recommend initial exploration of the patient's own ideas about aetiology, including appropriate medical tests. The physician should then change the agenda to a biopsychosocial perspective and identify current stressors and psychosocial variables that reinforce symptoms. Only a few randomised trials have been performed. They suggest that psychological treatment should be systematic and structured, with a focus on information, alternative ways of perception, and problem solving. Active forms of physiotherapy and psychopharmacological drugs may be of some benefit in selected patients.",

Iskustvo koje jednoj osobi uzrokuje neposrednu, nesnosljivu bol, u druge ce izazvati tek manji osjecaj nelagode. Degenerativne promjene na kraljesnici jedne su od uzroka pojave boli, a time i pojave emocionalnih stanja poput anksioznosti i depresije. Anksiozni poremecaji su vrlo ucestali poremecaji. Postoji puno naziva koji se koriste za anksioznost kao sto su tjeskoba, zabrinutost, nervoza, napetost, osjecaj da je osoba na rubu, u stresu. Anksioznost je sastavni dio života. Depresija je vise od obicne tuge, ako se tuga pojavi bez ikakva razloga ili ako ne prestaje, ako nam je tesko raditi, družiti se, spavati, jednom rijecju vise se ne možemo veseliti životu, onda to vise nije obicna tuga, nego depresija.\nCilj ovog rada je utvrditi intenzitet boli kod pacijenata sa bolnim sindromom kraljesnice, ispitati stupanj anksioznosti i depresivnosti kod sudionika i ispitati odnos između intenziteta i kvalitete boli i emocionalnih stanja kod sudionika. \nIstraživanje je provedeno u Opcoj bolnici ˝Dr. Ivo Pedisic˝ na odjelu za fizikalnu medicinu i rehabilitaciju. U ispitivanju je sudjelovalo 60 ispitanika. Varijable koje su ispitivane: bol, intenzitet i kvaliteta boli. Emocionalna stanja, anksioznost i depresivnost, potom sociodemografske varijable dob, spol, obrazovanje, bracni status i varijable zdravstvenog stanja (tjelesna aktivnost, drugi zdravstveni problemi, operacije, lijekovi).\nIstraživaje je pokazalo da je kod sudionika sa bolnim sindromima kraljesnice izraženija senzorna bol koju najcesce opisuju kao probadajucu, bolnu i ostru. Pokazalo se da postoji povezanost boli s emotivnim stanjem.

In individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), reports of psychosis have included cases that would meet criteria for delirium, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression. The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

The mental anguish occasioned by the situation is so great that subconsciously the patient prefers the distraction of simulated physical suffering.

Sympathy and attention that are not received when the patient is healthy and escape from unpleasant duties are factors which make this type of illness attractive and preferable. Too often the psychoneurosis is further fixed by a physician's diagnosis of organic disease and the scientific justification of the illness which such an opinion entails. Unfortunately, the patient is not aware of the connection between his symptoms and their causes. After the physician has gained the complete confidence of the patient, direct, tactful questioning often suffices to bring to light the underlying psychically traumatic situation.

      "abstract": "If an hysterical patient went to a physician in the late nineteenth century, chances were the diagnostic focus would be on the somatic symptomatology.The patient exhibiting hysterical blindness or paralysis was treated by an ophthalmologist or neurologist, who looked for pathological evidence of disease, deterioration, or damage.These procedures signaled a triumph over an earlier view that perceived hysteria as a largely female complaint in which a woman's uterus detached itself and floated about throughout her body.l With the work of Charcot, Janet, and especially Freud, hysteria came to be appreciated as an anxiety reaction whose pathological locus was emotional, not physiological, and was therefore not restricted to women.Today popular wisdom recognizes that certain cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms originate with severe psychological stress.Nevertheless, the attraction persists for accepting the manifest sign or symptom as the most accurate measure of mental and physical health.There is an obvious need to grapple with manifest behavior.But in some instances the more accurate interpretation of behavior is to be found in latent material.The word \"hysteria\" in ordinary usage denotes the loss of self-control and a diminished if not total incapacity for rational and logical thinking.Hysterical individuals therefore represent chaos, disorder, and a loss of reality testing.Yet the hysterical individual may also represent a complicated organization in which the overt symptoms of emotional collapse serve to conceal personality deficits and conflicts.Where the outward impression presented by the hysterical individual may seem disorderly, it may also signify a series of psychologically defensive maneuvers designed to maintain a distorted but nevertheless cohesive internal sense of order.In history the crowd has often been likened to the hysterical individual.In his celebrated nineteenth-century study, Gustave Le Bon included the following in his convictions about crowd behavior: \"It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of crowds there Mazon_3241.",

Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

      "abstract": "Post-stroke mood and emotional disturbances are frequent and diverse in their manifestations. Among them, post-stroke depression is the best known. Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

Often reactions appear immediately after the event, but they may appear hours, weeks or months later. Sights, sounds, and smells related to the incident can sneak up and create flashbacks, nightmares, sleep loss, physical illness and even death. This article gives an overview of the critical incident stress debriefing process (CISD), which is based on the known benefits of talking about an experience and venting thoughts and emotions. Specifically, the experience of the Public Works Department in Tempe, Arizona is discussed.",

Clinical and health-economic studies allowed the identification of the main factors involved in these adverse outcomes. Some factors are illness-dependent or related to personal characteristics, while others are linked to a wide range of psychosocial stresses.

The knowledge of the factors influencing the evolution of depressive syndromes gives an empirical basis to assess their consequences on work capacity. It should also guide public health policies.",

Persistent pain leads to psychological and behavioural issues. Medical conditions that consequently manifest include the co‐morbid psychological states of depression, anxiety and stress that can lead to suicide. Addiction plays a maladaptive role utilised by patients to escape their pain. Improved pain outcomes are achieved when instituting comprehensive psychological assessment and treatments with established medical and dental chronic pain protocols.",

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common. Madness experiences deserve attention, in the workplace and beyond.",

It is a common knowledge that comorbid anxiety and depression disorders can influence the course of various somatic illnesses and worsen their prognosis. We also have evidence-based studies that depression for example is an independent risk factor of heart infarct onset. On the other hand, we observe the somatization of clinical picture of mental disorders, the increase of atypical forms manifesting through pain or other somatic syndromes that leads to the increase of mental illnesses in the primary care. The research of common pathways of mental and somatic pathology should be the subject of further interdisciplinary research programs. The other issue is the patient's compliance that plays in important role in the success of every kind of treatment. Personality traits and status of mental health can influence ones attitude to illness as well as motivation to therapy. We cannot assess the population state of health without taking into consideration the evaluation of mental status as well as such definitions like subjective well being, life quality and stigmatization.

Physical and neurological examination, and electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging were unremarkable. There was no evidence to suggest cardiogenic causes, epilepsy, or cataplexy and a diagnosis of laughing syncope was made.Laughter-induced syncope is usually a single event in the majority of cases, but may present as recurrent attacks as in our case. Some cases occur in association with underlying neurological conditions. Prognosis is good in the case of neurally mediated attacks. Laughter may not be recognized by physicians as a cause of syncope, which may lead to unnecessary investigations or misdiagnosis, and affect patients' quality of life.",

Muscle pain and other types of subjective health complaints are among the most frequent reason for encounters with general practitioners, and one of the major causes for sickness absence. The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required. The difficult thing is that this threshold is individual and subjective. The psychiatric definitions of these complaints, therefore, refer only to the tip of an iceberg.",

There is a high association of co-morbid medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial disorders, as with chronic pain in general. Attention to history, especially onset and aggravating factors, can be crucial in identifying the etiology. Physical examination, including neurological and myofascial exam, can often provide important clues to identifying the most appropriate treatments. Many of the chronic facial pain syndromes are unique, given the complex anatomy and specialized sensory innervation of the head, face, and neck, and often pose diagnostic challenges. Due to the host of therapies available for facial pain it is imperative for the clinician to guide patients through therapeutic options to maximize treatment efficacy.",

      "title": "Clinical Effectiveness of Tofrānil in the Treatment of Depressive Psychoses",
      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Workers in the various fields of child behavior have long been aware that mental disturbances of different kinds result, in some patients, from some type and degree of organic defect causing either generalized or localized impairment of function of brain tissue. The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage. Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others. In medicine, the classical picture of the brain-injured child has traditionally included some motor defect as a primary condition. Beginning",

Intrusive orgasms arise spontaneously and very frequently, which hinders the patient’s daily routine, work and sleep and leads to significant functional impairment. This condition is unwanted by the individual and perceived as unpleasant and impossible to control.

      "title": "The Development of Illness Anxiety Disorder in a Patient After Partial Thyroidectomy",
      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), characterises illness anxiety disorder (IAD) as the preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness in the absence of somatic symptoms (or, if present, symptoms that are only mild in severity). DSM-5 includes illness anxiety disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, characterised by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning. More often than in psychiatric settings, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered in primary care and specialist medical settings. Despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and adequate reassurances from specialists, their conviction of being ill persists. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous, and the degree of insight is variable. Their illness-related preoccupation interferes with their relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. They are frequently addicted to internet searches about their feared illness, inferring the worst from the information (or false information) they uncover. Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Typically, illness anxiety disorder is chronic. Physical symptoms are absent or mild and frequently represent a misinterpretation of normal bodily sensations. This case report presents the case of a patient diagnosed with IAD by a psychiatrist. The patient had been seen by his primary care physician and therapist for three years without any improvement in his symptoms before he was referred to a psychiatrist. After undergoing a partial thyroidectomy in 2018, this patient has been experiencing increasing symptoms of recurrent anxiety/fear consistent with IAD, despite extensive medical examinations that have consistently revealed normal results.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

Reactive depressive syndromes can be associated with the restriction of social competence due to increasing multi-morbidity, loneliness, social isolation, the consequences of retirement, interpersonal conflicts, and the loss of partners or close relatives. Endogenous depressive syndromes in the elderly are frequently combined with diffuse and changing somatic complaints, psychomotor restlessness and agitation. Furthermore, depressive syndromes can be caused by somatic illness, degenerative disorders, other organic diseases or certain drugs. The presence of simultaneously occurring somatic illness, positive family history, certain personality traits, and severity of disease could exert an adverse influence on clinical outcome. Medical treatment should consider the special pharmacological features of old age, and should be combined with psychotherapy as well as a close involvement of the relatives.",

Immer mehr verschwimmen die Grenzen zwischen Privatem und Beruflichem. Neben „klassischem“ Arbeitsstress – häufig definiert als Missverhältnis von hohen Anforderungen bei gleichzeitig geringen Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten oder als Missverhältnis zwischen Arbeitseinsatz und Belohnung – gehören u. a. Überarbeitung, Mobbing und Arbeitsplatzverlust sowie negative Arbeitsplatzbedingungen zu den Belastungen, die seelische und körperliche gesundheitliche Probleme auslösen können. Evidenz aus Megastudien mit &gt; 100000 Teilnehmern belegt die Bedeutung von Arbeitsstress als Risikofaktor (RF) für Hypertonie, Schlafstörungen und Depressionen. Unter Arbeitsstress werden häufig gesundheitsgefährdende Verhaltensweisen als Kompensationsversuche eingesetzt. Andauernder Arbeitsstress wird damit zu einem signifikanten RF für ischämische Herzerkrankungen, zerebrovaskuläre Ereignisse und Diabetes mellitus. Arbeitsstress sollte daher in der kardiologischen Praxis exploriert werden. Grundzüge einer auf Arbeitsstress fokussierten Gesprächsführung für den Alltagseinsatz werden vorgestellt.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Dizziness and vertigo may be the result of trauma to the peripheral vestibular system or the central nervous system, or, in some cases, may be due to anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder; these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. While most peripheral vestibular disorders can be identified by testing and examination, those without inner ear causes that have persisting complaints of dizziness and motion sickness are more difficult to understand and to manage. Some of these patients exhibit features compatible with vestibular migraine and may be treated successfully with migraine preventative medications. This paper reviews the neurological causes of persisting dizziness, the possible mechanisms, and the pathophysiology, as a framework for patient management and for future research.

      "title": "Pramenstrnelles Syndrom nnd Dysmenorrho",
      "abstract": "Der Begriff pramenstruelles beinhaltet eine Vielzahl von somatischen und psychischen Veranderungen, die im Zusammenhang mit der Menstruation auftreten. Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

It is divided into: non-specific back pain, back pain associated with radiculopathy and back pain associated with another specific cause. Non-specific low back pain is the most common type, it makes 85% of all cases. It is important to exclude „red flags“ – symptoms and signs that could indicate serious etiology of back pain while taking history and during physical examination. If serious pathology is suspected, patient should be reffered to a specialist. Radiological diagnostics and additional tests are not necessary in patients with non-specific low back pain and low back pain with radiculopathy in the first 4-6 weeks. The most common causes of non-specific low back pain are: muscle and ligament strain, degenerative changes, spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. The most common causes of back pain with radiculopathy are disc herniation and spinal stenosis. Back pain caused by other, specific causes is rare and potential causes are numerous. Psychogenic and psychosomatic back pain require multidisciplinary approach . Yellow flags and Waddell signs can help in diagnosis. Non-specific low back pain and back pain with radiculopathy are treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen and muscle relaxants, along with other recommendations. The patient must be instructed to come for reevaluation in 1-3 weeks. Patient should also receive education on preventive measures.",

Not surprisingly, the pediatric rheumatologist is frequently called to distinguish organic from functional symptoms. During the past decade, the pediatric rheumatology community has been evaluating increasing numbers of adolescents and preadolescents who experience musculoskeletal symptoms presumably as a defense against emotional stress from achievement either in academic work or in sports. To complicate the challenge further, coexistent organic and psychologic disturbance is not rare. Clearly, organic illness does not protect a patient from emotional plan, and it may be most difficult to differentiate nonorganic pain in a patient with a known organic illness. Conversely, adolescents with organic illness may use their disease for secondary gain. Fear of misdiagnosis of physical illness as psychiatric and the notion that all of the patient's complaints should be explained by a unifying diagnosis cause diagnostic error in both psychogenic illness with physical manifestations and physical illness with psychogenic symptoms.",

However, chronic pain often can produce depression, anxiety, and marital difficulties. Although physical examination and other studies, including x-ray studies, 3D-CT, electromyelograms (EMG), nerve conduction velocity studies and MRI in many cases may document an organic basis of chronic back pain, some organic syndromes defy definition by objective tests. This may be a greater problem for women, where physician prejudice can result in a significantly less extensive evaluation of their complaints of back pain. Also, any litigation may influence symptoms and the type of litigation may influence outcomes [8].

These were extreme irritability, pronounced startle reaction, bizarre tremors and automatic movements, some loss of memory, headaches and a decided drop in efficiency.

General symptoms include vomiting, headache, loss of consciousness up to coma, meningitic syndrome. Clinical picture of hemiplegia is develops through several stages. First stage is flaccid or and lasts 10-14 days. The second stage is chronic or spastic and happens at 2-3rd week after the stroke. The cerebrovascular stroke is diagnosed by obtaining a medical history in which dominates longlasting headache, loss of consciousness and high blood pressure. Another method of diagnose is CT. On the other hand, MRI is sensitive and selective method. It can detect vascular malformation (aneurysm). The rehabilitation should start as soon as possible in order to prevent: contractures, decubitus or other skin damage. Depending of the patients improving,we start improving the quality of daily activities: dressing, using phone feeding, personal hygiene etc. Therefore, the role of the physiotherapist in hemiplegic patient’s life is very important because he has to work with the patient completely dedicated from the earliest to the final stage of the rehabilitation.",

O fenômeno da \"dor rebote\" foi demonstrado e descrito como uma dor muito intensa que ocorre após a resolução do bloqueio de nervo periférico com o retorno da sensibilidade. A incidência de dor rebote é desconhecida. Normalmente ela ocorre entre 12 a 24 horas após a cirurgia e afeta negativamente a qualidade do sono. Ainda não é possível estabelecer um mecanismo como causa definitiva ou fator desencadeante da dor rebote. Estudos sugerem que a dor rebote seja um efeito colateral dos bloqueios de nervos periféricos, apesar destes terem eficácia no controle álgico. Atualmente, a extensão e a significância clínica da dor rebote não podem ser bem determinadas, devido à falta de grandes estudos prospectivos. A avaliação da dor rebote deve ser sempre considerada na prática clínica, pois não é um efeito colateral raro dos bloqueios de nervo periféricos. Ainda existem muitas questões desafiadoras a serem respondidas sobre a dor rebote, portanto fazem‐se necessários amplos estudos prospectivos sobre a temática. Para a sua prevenção recomenda‐se o uso de técnicas de bloqueio de nervo periférico que evitem a lesão do nervo e uma adequada analgesia perioperatória associada à orientação do paciente sobre a administração precoce de analgésicos mesmo na vigência da analgesia proporcionada pelo bloqueio de nervo periférico. A melhor compreensão do fenômeno \"dor rebote\", sua fisiopatologia, seus fatores de risco associados e suas consequências em longo prazo poderá ajudar na elaboração de estratégias preventivas mais eficazes. To investigate, describe, and assess the phenomenon of \"rebound pain\" as a clinically relevant problem in anesthetic practice. The phenomenon of \"rebound pain\" has been demonstrated and described as a very severe pain, which occurs after a peripheral nerve block resolution with the recovery of sensitivity. The incidence of rebound pain is unknown. Usually, it occurs between 12 to 24 hours after surgery and adversely affecting sleep quality. It is not yet possible to establish a mechanism as a definitive cause or trigger factor of rebound pain. Studies suggest that rebound pain is a side effect of peripheral nerve blocks, despite their effectiveness in pain control. Currently, the extent and clinical significance of rebound pain cannot be well determined due to the lack of large prospective studies. Rebound pain assessment should always be considered in clinical practice, as it is not a rare side effect of peripheral nerve blocks. There are still many challenging questions to be answered about rebound pain, so large prospective studies are needed to address the issue. For prevention, the use of peripheral nerve block techniques that avoid nerve damage and adequate perioperative analgesia associated with patient education on the early administration of analgesics, even during the period of analgesia provided by peripheral nerve block, is recommended. A better understanding of the \"rebound pain\" phenomenon, its pathophysiology, associated risk factors, and long‐term consequences may help in developing more effective preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the psychobiological effects on children and adolescents upon exposure to a traumatic happening where there is a real or imaginary threat of bodily harm or death to the self and/or others. Morbidity may involve the classic symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder such as a readiness to re-experience the psychological and physiological effects of trauma exposure, autonomic arousal, somatic ills and subsequent avoidant behavior as well as a host of other psychological morbidities such as depression, mood dysregulation and other internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Multimodal treatment approaches implementing family and social supports, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral techniques have the strongest evidence base. Psychopharmacologic interventions are not generally used, but may be necessary as an adjunct to other interventions for children with severe reactions or coexisting psychiatric conditions.",

Headache may be a symptom of other pathology (secondary headache) or due to a primary headache disorder. Tension headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches are three primary headache syndromes, in order of most frequently occurring to least. The key to effective management of these chronic syndromes is differential diagnosis through history, physical exam, and possibly diagnostic studies. Pharmacologic management may include abortive, adjunctive, and prophylactice medications.",

Pain becomes chronic only when this unpleasant sensory and emotional experience persists for much longer than expected relative to the severity or duration of the initial noxious stimulus. The regions of symptom onset, patterns of radiation or referral to other body sites, and any association with loss or excess of somatic sensation within the symptomatic regions have major relevance in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

Anxiety is a signal alerting the individual of ‘danger.’ This danger can be unknown, internal, conflictual and vague. The anxiety signal allows the individual to respond to, and resolve the ‘danger.’ This is to be differentiated from fear which is the emotional response to a real or perceived imminent threat. These two states overlap but differ in that fear more often triggers the physiologic response of fight or flight. Anxiety disorders result when one or both of these systems are in a chronic ‘hyper reactive’ state for either biologic or psychologic reasons.

      "abstract": "Chronic abdominopelvic pain is a debilitating problem that presents challenges to patients and clinicians alike. Symptoms of abdominopelvic pain are among the most commo symptoms presenting to primary care and fall within the scope of a large number of medical specialities, especially gynaecology, gastroenterology, and urology. Such pain can be a warning sign of serious pathology, but chronic abdominopelvic pain must be recognized as a disease in its own right, since it can exist as a chronic condition without identifiable pathology. Traditionally, the management of pelvic pain has focused on biomedical mechanisms such as infective, inflammatory, or malignant conditions; it is now understood, however, that many of the mechanisms are attributable to modulation of pain processing within the nervous system. Although a peripheral stimulus such as inflammation may initiate pelvic pain, the condition or syndrome may become persistent as a result of these mechanisms. Chronic pain syndromes are associated with a variety of cognitive, behavioural, social, sexual, and functional phenomena. These form the basis for diagnosis and must be addressed through multidisciplinary care. Functional disorders, for the purpose of this article, are disorders characterized by disturbance of function (such as urinary urge/frequency in bladder pain syndrome). The term is not used in the sense of a psychiatric functional disorder. Associated psychological disturbances should be considered a result of the disease rather than a cause and there must be an associated conceptual shift, in healthcare providers who work with these patients, to acknowledge this. The authors acknowledge that ongoing organ pathology, such as endometriosis, can produce persistent pain, but the management of specific diseases is beyond the scope of this article. This article will focus on pain syndromes in which no identifiable cause can be found.",

      "title": "A study of hysteria among youth in a secondary school in Malaysia",
      "abstract": "Hysteria is regarded as a symptom of emotional disturbance and mental disorder that is common among adolescent girls. It often occurs in schools during classes. Hysteria often begins with one student and subsequently spreads to other students, as many as 20-50 at one time. Its bizarre symptoms include sudden shouting, struggling, crying for no reason, talking unintelligibly and body paralysis. Previous research on hysteria by psychologists, psychiatrists and physicians from an alternative Islamic approach has identified many factors that cause hysteria. Hysteria may be related to cultural factors or to individual values and beliefs. Psychologists believe that the main factor in hysteria is emotional stress experienced by the patient. The hysterical reaction is one way for these patients to release emotional stress. Teenagers who suffer from uncontrolled stress may express themselves through hysteria. Psychiatrists suggest that hysteria may occur as a result of extreme emotional stress arising from long, unresolved and unexpressed emotional conflicts. In 2008 and 2009, hysteria occurred frequently among adolescent students in Malaysia and involved students in both boarding schools and day schools. This is an alarming situation for schools and parents because this phenomenon has an effect on the learning process and a psychological impact on students. Therefore, this study examined the phenomenon of hysteria to identify its factors, symptoms and treatment. The respondents included 41 girls who experienced hysteria at one school in Selangor, Malaysia. This study was conducted with questionnaires and interviews. Hysteria can be caused by psychological factors, psychiatric disorders and the cultural and religious factors. Common symptoms of hysteria include difficulty sleeping, aches and pains, extreme anxiety, hallucinations and nightmares. Hysteria can have a psychological effect on adolescents who experience it. Therefore, ways of managing hysteria must be identified, especially from a psychological perspective.",

      "title": "Psychological Morbidity Associated with Orthopedic Trauma",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the clinical consequences of psychological morbidity associated with orthopedic trauma. Previous work has reported that mental illness is an independent predictor of poor outcome following orthopedic trauma, and future studies should explore whether management of psychological symptoms independently predicts recovery from orthopedic trauma. Anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders may all flare up during the post-operative period, leading to psychiatric consultation. Other common general post-operative issues include complications related to alcohol abuse, dependence, and withdrawal; pain management in opioid-dependent patients; the presence of personality disorders and other causes of lack of cooperation; and post-operative delirium. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also common after surgery, particularly after traumatic injuries, but is underrecognized and undertreated. Previous research has evaluated these and other issues in surgical patients. Although psychiatric problems are seen less frequently than previously, the orthopaedic surgeon must remain aware of their possible effect. The prevalence of psychological illness following traumatic injuries varies according to the diagnostic criteria used in studies, the timing of the assessment and definitions of trauma. Estimates of psychological symptoms following musculoskeletal trauma have ranged from 6.5% to 51.0%. Mason assessed the psychological state of 210 male accident and emergency department patients and followed them for 18 months, at which time 30% satisfied criteria for a psychiatric disorder. A recent study of patients with severe lower limb injuries found a 42% prevalence of psychological disorder at 24-month follow-up and that only 22% of such patients reported receiving mental health services. No relation was found between injury severity and psychological distress; however, the authors suggested that low variability in injury severity might have obscured this result. McCarthy further identified a high correlation between the Brief Symptom Inventory (a measure of psychological distress) and the Sickness Impact Profile (a measure of patient function). A high index of suspicion for the presence of psychiatric disorders is important in treating the orthopaedic patient with multiple trauma, chronic disease, factitious disorder, or suspected malingering or who fails to improve with recognized treatment. Recognition of a psychiatric problem should be part of preoperative planning in orthopaedic practice, and a formal psychiatric referral for diagnosis and treatment should be made for the patient with significant psychiatric involvement. When associated psychiatric disease is diagnosed and controlled before orthopaedic treatment commences, the patient is more likely to comply with the treatment regimen, which may lead to better results. It is important for providers who care for patients with minor injury to include a psychiatric history and/or rapid screening for psychiatric disorders as part of the health assessment. Psychosocial factors, specifically, ongoing litigation and psychological symptoms are related with reduced health-related quality of life. Further, the goal of care is to help patients attain maximal functional recovery. Therefore, the presence of a positive psychiatric history or a current psychiatric disorder should stimulate a referral of these patients for appropriate emotional support and therapeutic follow-up. By doing so, providers will give patients important interventions to maximize full recovery.",

The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help. Successful treatment is very important for\r\n good communication that needs to be established with the patient and that his family is involved\r\n with the patient as well, because it should be the greatest support and support, and this can\r\n greatly affect the course and outcome of the treatment. The first contact of the patient and his\r\n family with the doctor is through a medical interview, and by the arrival of the patient in the\r\n institution and the search for professional help, the health care service begins to be provided on\r\n an individual level for each patient in a holistic approach involving the entire health care team\r\n employees.\r\n Social awareness of human rights, violence and disasters has increased over the last 20 years,\r\n which has contributed to wars and natural disasters, which has led to the development of\r\n psychotraumatology. In Croatia, the area of psychotraumatology began to develop more\r\n intensively at the beginning of the 90s of the last century or during the Homeland War.",

      "abstract": "What's the post-traumatic stress disorder? Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health problem by virtue of its frequency, chronicity and the disability it generates in daily life. PTSD has been known since Antiquity and explored by military psychiatrists and early psychoanalysts, but today more than ever it is a topical issue because of the large number of events such as terrorist attacks or meteorological disasters that occurred lately in France and outside the country. This disorder is characterized by four main dimensions: reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and cognitive and mood disturbances. Sleep is very often disrupted and comorbidity is common. The suicidal risk is also frequent. PTSD can affect anybody even though a number of individual risk factors have been identified, such as gender, socio-economic status and psychiatric or traumatic history, with a special focus on peri-traumatic dissociation. As we know, this disorder is the result of exceptional events but is can also be the consequence of more \"daily\" events which general practitioners are often the first to be consulted for. Despite an apparent \"popularization\" of the symptoms by greater media coverage, this specific disorder is still poorly understood in its definition and in routine medical practice.Qu’est-ce que le trouble de stress post-traumatique ? Le trouble de stress post-traumatique est un réel problème de santé publique en raison de sa fréquence, de sa chronicité et du handicap généré au quotidien. Connu depuis l’Antiquité, exploré par les psychiatres militaires et les premiers psychanalystes, il est aujourd’hui plus que jamais d’actualité du fait des événements de grande ampleur (terrorismes, catastrophes météorologiques…) survenus en France, et hors territoire, ces derniers temps. Ce trouble est caractérisé par quatre dimensions principales qui sont l’intrusion, l’évitement, l’hypervigilance, les perturbations cognitives et de l’humeur. Le sommeil est très souvent altéré et la comorbidité fréquente. Le risque suicidaire est également élevé. Le trouble de stress post-traumatique touche une population « tout-venant » même si ont été identifiés un certain nombre de facteurs de risque, comme le sexe, le niveau socio-économique, les antécédents psychiatriques ou traumatiques, etc., avec une place particulière de la dissociation péritraumatique. Les événements à caractère exceptionnel ne doivent pas faire oublier que le quotidien reste aussi un grand pourvoyeur de cette pathologie et que les médecins généralistes sont souvent les premiers consultés. Malgré une apparente « vulgarisation » des symptômes par une plus grande médiatisation, ce trouble spécifique reste encore mal connu dans sa définition et mal appréhendé en pratique médicale courante.",

Is trauma an event or a feeling? The name of posttraumatic stress disorder would plead for a definition according to which it is an event that has already ended when the disorder starts to manifest itself. The disorder follows the trauma. Trauma has an objective and a subjective side, and hence requires a dialectic approach. It is an ecopsychological approach of the issue, which defines psychological trauma from an ecologically dialectic viewpoint, by combining the two approaches. The therapeutic approach principles rely on the fact that a dangerous feed-back cycle occurs among the traumatizing environmental factors (environmental), emotional responses, bodily sensations and moods (endogenous), as well as thoughts, menesic representations and images (encephalic), which cycle requires therapeutic measures to be broken.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis.

Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation.

      "title": "What Acute Stress Protocols Can Tell Us About PTSD and Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the fifth most prevalent mental disorder in the US, is a chronic, debilitating mental illness with as yet limited options for treatment. Hallmark symptoms of PTSD include intrusive memory of trauma, avoidance of reminders of the event, hyperarousal and hypervigilance, emotional numbing and anhedonia. PTSD is often triggered by exposure to a single traumatic experience, such as a traffic accident, a natural catastrophe, or an episode of violence. This suggests that stressful events have a primary role in the pathogenesis of the disorder, although genetic background and previous life events are likely involved. However, pathophysiology of this mental disorder, as for major depression and anxiety disorders, is still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown how can a single traumatic, stressful event induce a disease that can last for years or decades. A major shift in the conceptual framework investigating neuropsychiatric disorders has occurred in recent years, from a monoamine-oriented hypothesis (which dominated pharmacological research for over half a century) to a neuroplasticity hypothesis, which posits that structural and functional changes in brain circuitry (largely in the glutamate system) mediate psychopathology and also therapeutic action. Rodent stress models are very useful to understand pathophysiology of PTSD. Recent studies with acute or subacute stress models have shown that exposure to short-time stressors (from several minutes to a few hours) can induce not only rapid, but also sustained changes in synaptic function (glutamate release, synaptic transmission/plasticity), neuroarchitecture (dendritic morphology, synaptic spines) and behavior (cognitive functions). Some of these changes, e.g., stress-induced increased glutamate release and dendrite retraction, are likely connected and occur more rapidly than previously thought. We propose here to use a modified version of a simple and validated protocol of footshock stress to explore different trajectories in the individual response to acute stress. This new conceptual framework may enable us to identify determinants of resilient versus vulnerable response as well as new targets for treatment, in particular for rapid-acting antidepressants. It will be interesting to investigate the putative prophylactic action of ketamine towards the maladaptive effects of acute stress in this new protocol.",

Because trauma is so common in medical practice, in the form of accidents, severe illness, and sometimes medical and surgical treatments, these disorders are commonly seen by physicians. An initial severe reaction to a traumatic event such as severe accident is an acute stress disorder and is commonly characterized by dissociation. A more long-lasting emotional reaction to ongoing stress such as a new diagnosis of life-threatening illness is termed an adjustment disorder. An often longer-lasting and more severe psychological reaction associated with repeated mental re-experiencing of the traumatic event is called post-traumatic stress disorder. These trauma-related disorders are not only an important cause of suffering but may also complicate medical care, hence they require recognition and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "An Undervalued Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Perinatal Period: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that occurs around childbirth, typically after a traumatic birth experience, where women may feel violated due to traumatic childbirth interventions they cannot control. Traumatic birth is defined as an event in which the mother perceives a real or perceived threat to herself or her baby, causing intense fear, helplessness, and horror. This can be considered an obstetric sequel. It is relevant to note that among pregnant women, perinatal PTSD is the third most common psychiatric disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 0.8% to 43% worldwide. Despite its significance, it is little-known, underdiagnosed, and often confused with other conditions such as depression or anxiety. Furthermore, it results in serious family, social, and occupational dysfunctions and is associated with other pathologies. Clinically, women with perinatal PTSD experience symptoms such as re-experiencing the event, detachment from the newborn, nightmares, irritability, and rejection of motherhood. This can lead to consequences for the mother, ranging from a desire not to become pregnant again to severe symptoms such as dissociation, stress, anxiety, and depression. It also affects those close to the mother, such as the partner and family. The aim of this work is to describe perinatal PTSD and emphasize the importance of early identification and appropriate treatment by medical professionals for the benefit of mothers and their children THE CASE: We describe a 35-year-old patient with a history of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder since 2018 experiences perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder. This is related to physical and verbal abuse during her second childbirth, resulting in a traumatic experience. Her childhood was marked by the feeling that her mother favored her younger sister and subjected her to physical and emotional abuse. The first pregnancy was unplanned, and she faced humiliation and abandonment by her partner. Despite the circumstances, the birth was a positive experience. The second pregnancy was planned and desired, but during childbirth in a different clinic from the first, she experienced inadequate care conditions, a lack of privacy, and physical abuse by medical staff. She also received inappropriate comments from the attending gynecologist. During the postpartum period, she shared a room with a cancer patient, complicating her experience. After childbirth, she experienced a hypertensive disorder in the postpartum and chose not to return to the hospital where she gave birth due to her traumatic experiences. Overall, her story reveals a series of challenging experiences related to motherhood that have contributed to her current mental health state. CONCLUSION: Perinatal PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that affects a significant number of pregnant and postpartum women. Its prevalence varies widely, reflecting the need for increased awareness and early detection. Despite its considerable impact on maternal mental health and well-being, perinatal PTSD is often overlooked or confused with other conditions such as depression and anxiety. It's important to raise awareness among medical staff about this disorder and provide a comprehensive and empathetic approach to enhance care for mothers during childbirth and the postpartum period.",

      "abstract": "La comorbilidad de trastornos de ansiedad y TUS es muy frecuente en el campo de la patologia. Ambos trastornos pueden ser primarios, el trastorno de ansiedad puede ser secundario (inducido) al consumo de drogas, o viceversa. El DSM-IV-TR1 describe 12 trastornos de ansiedad y 10 trastornos de ansiedad inducidos. Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships.

While some cases are a continuation of the chronic course of illness beginning in early adulthood, a large number of persons will have a first episode of depression in later life following alife-time of relatively good mental health. While incident cases of major depression tend to decrease with age, the number of persons with clinically significant depressive symptomatology rises. À distinction has often been made between early-onset and late-onset depression, however, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest these are distinct clinical entities. On the other hand observations from a fifteen year prospective population study of psychiatric disorder in the elderly (the ESPRIT Study) supports the alternative idea that depression may be divided into sub-types according to postulated aetiology; for example depression with a strong genetic component, related to hormonal changes, the consequence of trauma; the result of cerebrovascular insult. Exposure to these putative causes may be more common at different points in the life span, thus suggesting age-differences. Our research further suggests that even cases of depression appearing for the first time in late-life, may be initially triggered by risk factors occurring decades before. Our findings suggest, for example, that childhood events may lead to changes in the biology of stress management, which continue throughout life, increasing vulnerability to depression and persisting even after effective treatment of symptoms. Together these observations suggest it may be more meaningful to classify depression in the elderly according to probable principle precipitating factors rather than age.",

At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The essential feature of somatization disorder and related disorders is that the patient presents multiple, medically unexplained symptoms or functional somatic symptoms. These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

Phobias are distinguished from anxiety, and some classifications also separate panic attacks. Patients should be assessed carefully to detect associated problems in their lives and to seek evidence of underlying illness, such as depression and organic brain disease, that may present as anxiety. Conversely it should be remembered that some patients presenting with anxiety have an underlying physical illness. Drugs are often not necessary to treat neurotic anxiety, and in many instances a simple form of psychotherapy or sometimes behaviour therapy may succeed.",

Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components. Obviously those syndromes of diseases are increasing where only pure psychosomatic facts exist, that is to say when soma is not the primary source but the scenery.",

As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

Se define el estrés y se clasifica desde diferentes perspectivas. El estrés es una causa de tensión y exigencia o mecanismo de adaptación.El estrés y la presentación del primer episodio depresivo están directamente relacionados, sin embargo cuando se presentan recurrencias el estrés significativo pierde fuerza dentro de los factores que lo desencadenan. Los estresores, especialmente los psicosociales, están relacionados con la presentación de recurrencias. Entre estos se destacan estresores internos y externos, por sucesos vitales, estrés de rol y las contrariedades cotidianas, la alta exigencia y el perfeccionismo. El no cumplimiento de metas es otro factor provocador de crisis en la transición del ciclo vital. El neuroticismo y el perfeccionismo, como actitudes disfuncionales provocan aislamiento y falta de soporte social. Los esquemas cognitivos disfuncionales conducen a un procesamiento erróneo de la información. La depresión es una pauta de relación que no permite encontrar formas adaptativas de enfrentar la vida y conducir las relaciones interpersonales. Aunque hay nuevas visiones que la consideran como un esfuerzo adaptativo. La comorbilidad puede hacer recurrir la depresión. Se ha sugerido que patrones maladaptativos cognitivos, en particular en interacción con estresores, podrían llevar a pobres resultados en el tratamiento de sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor en comorbilidad con trastornos de personalidad. Estos, independientemente del estado de la depresión, han sido asociados con elevadas actitudes disfuncionales.",

      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

Close supervision is important for monitoring the welfare of the worker as well as the accomplishment of the many tasks associated with recovery and identification of the dead following a disaster.

Lecturas bibliograficas han puesto en comun que dentro de todos los trastornos mentales que pueden existir en una puerpera, la Psicosis puerperal es de la mas grave tanto en carga asistencial como en cuidados que conlleva para el nucleo familiar y para el equipo terapeutico que realiza el seguimiento. No existe tratado de obstetricia general sin que se encuentre un capitulo dedicado a la Psicosis puerperal, y, con mayor razon y frecuencia, presente en las obras de psiquiatria, donde no es raro ver descrito la relacion entre el embarazo, parto y la lactancia con la locura, ocupando un capitulo dicha patologia especifica en la etiologia general de las enfermedades mentales. La atencion a la paciente con psicosis puerperal desde el punto de vista de la enfermeria, engloba aspectos clinicos-asistenciales; basados tanto en el diagnostico, en su curso posterior, en el vinculo establecido madre-hijo, y, en su entorno. Desde este trabajo se pretende revisar los conocimientos recogidos sobre la Psicosis puerperal, valorar los distintos recursos existentes en Espana y hacer una comparativa con el resto de paises, como propuesta final se lleva a cabo la inclusion de un programa de educacion para fomentar los conocimientos tanto en el personal de enfermeria como en las mujeres que deberia estar presente en el Plan Integral de la Mujer en atencion primaria. Abstract: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Postpartum are vital and stressful events that can sometimes lead to emotional imbalances, as much in the woman herself as in her environment. A Bibliographic survey makes it clear that from all mental disorders that may exist in a mother on postpartum period , Postpartum Psychosis is the most serious of them all , the heaviest burden to the healthcare system involving both the household and the therapeutic team who treats the disorder. There is no such thing as an Obstetrics treaty without a chapter on Puerperal Psychosis; and it is also more often present in the works of General Psychiatry, where it is not uncommon to describe links between Pregnancy, Childbirth, Lactation and Madness. This pathology earned a chapter of its own in the general Etiology of mental illnesses. The treatment of the patient with Puerperal Psychosis, from the Nursing point of view, includes clinical and care aspects, it is based both on diagnosis, evolution, it is set in the mother-child existing bond, and in the environment. This work pretends to review the knowledge gathered on Puerperal Psychosis, to assess the different resources that are available in Spain and to establish a comparison with other countries. As a final proposal, we describe which of all therapeutic activities are performed by the nursing team. Palabra Clave: Psicosis Puerperal; Psicosis Postparto; Enfermeria; Puerperio, Vinculo madre-hijo. Key Words: Puerperal Psychosis; Postpartum Psychosis; Nursing Treatment in Puerperal Psychosis; Nursing Intervention; Mother-infant bond.",

Kecelakaan lalu lintas masih menjadi penyebab utama cedera otak traumatik di negara berkembang seperti Indonesia. Hal ini berbeda dengan negara-negara maju yang menunjukkan bahwa peristiwa jatuh (fall) menduduki peringkat pertama penyebab cedera otak traumatik. Fakta tersebut juga didukung dengan penggunaan obat-obat antikoagulan, terutama oleh pasine lanjut usia. Berbeda halnya dengan di Indonesia, yang sebagian besar pasien cedera otak traumatik merupakan laki-laki usia produktif. Akibatnya, selain disabilitas yang bisa terjadi, terdapat dampak sosial ekonomi yang serius. Pasien tersebut menjadi kesulitan bekerja dan mencari nafkah untuk dirinya dan keluarganya. Secara definisi, segala jenis gangguan fungsional atau struktural di otak akibat proses trauma berupa energi dari luar tubuh termasuk dalam cedera otak traumatik. Hal ini menekankan bahwa terminologi cedera kepala sudah kurang tepat lagi digunakan dalam praktik sehari-hari karena fokus dari masalahnya adalah otak secara spesifik, bukan kepala. Dengan demikian, penilaian klinis pada pasien cedera otak traumatik tidak hanya sebatas abnormalitas pada radiologi, tetapi jauh yang lebih penting juga pada fungsi otaknya. Pada beberapa kasus, hasil CT scan tidak menunjukkan lesi struktural yang bermakna, tetapi pasiennya mengalami nyeri kepala kronik, sulit berkonsentrasi, mudah lelah, atau gangguan mood. Hal lain yang menarik dari cedera otak traumatik adalah mekanisme trauma yang dialami oleh pasien dan hubungannya dengan gangguan yang didapat. Hal ini yang disebut sebagai biomekanisme penting untuk diketahui oleh para klinisi yang merawat pasien karena seringkali data anamnesis dari pasien atau orang lain tidak selalu akurat. Lebih jauh daripada itu, bisa jadi ada kepentingan tertentu dari dari pihak pasien atau lainnya untuk memanipulasi mekanisme trauma. Oleh sebab itu, dengan menguasai pengetahuan ini, dan didukung kemampuan klinis yang adekuat, klinisi bisa mengambil langkah bila terdapat ketidaksesuaian antara mekanisme trauma dengan cedera yang didapat.",

Head injuries by contrast can occur in many sports and, except those incurred during boxing, are accidental. Unlike other injuries, the effects of which are usually maximal at onset, injury to the head may precipitate a process of intracranial disorder that can convert a mild initial injury into a life threatening condition from secondary complications. Moreover, even mild injuries are often associated with considerable temporary disability, and repeated mild injuries can result in cumulative brian damage. Doctors on sports fields have to decide whether patients with head injury can resume play or, if not, what further immediate management is needed and when they can play again. The answers to these questions depend on a sensible balancing of risks.\n\nIt is damage to the brain that matters when the head is hit. Injuries to the scalp or skull are important only as indicators of the possibility of underlying impact damage or of the risk of complications that could cause secondary brain damage. Either impact or secondary brain damage may be diffuse or focal, and this will influence the clinical features.\n\n(1) Cerebral contusions - Bruising on the brain surface due to the brain's impact with the overlying skull - are the commonest form of impact damage. Contusion may be focal underneath a fracture resulting from a focal impact, blunt or penetrating, or it may be diffuse, resulting from the brain as a whole being thrown against the rough interior surface of the skull and dural dividers.

Any such life-experience is considered traumatic whenever it is subjectively interpreted by the one experiencing the event as potentially life-threatening, extremely stressful, frightening, and outside of individual control.",

Progress in functional investigations, especially electrophysiological tests, has allowed to define new clinical entities such as pudendal neuralgia or pain linked to pelvic floor disorders. Treatments have been improved, but remain empirical outside these well defined entities. In practice, clinical examination is the main diagnostic step, which allows to exclude common anorectal or pelviperineal lesions, and to consider additional investigations. However diagnosis may remain entirely clinical in some typical presentations.",

Any human activity is accompanied by certain feelings, sensations and experiences. All these psychophysiological states with individual specifics are usually called emotional.

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

Because this ubiquitous symptom has remained so long a mystery, any discovery or theory concerning its mechanism and alleviation is even more intriguing. We know pain exists, but we may be unable to find its cause. If we do find the cause, there may be no correlation between the extent of disease and the degree of patient suffering. A condition that causes excruciating pain in one person may be completely tolerable to another. Even if the cause is removed, suffering may continue. Pain is entirely subjective, but we know it exists when we see the distressed patient. We cannot see the pain, but we recognize its presence in facial expression, verbal description, body language, and objective clinical signs (eg, pallor, rapid pulse, sweating, and others). The patient may feel that he must convince us of its reality, but",

These sensory manifestations may include the element of pain, but usually they are not confined to a single somatic segment or focal visceral area. Localized pain, as an isolated phenomenon not associated with somatic convulsive seizures or with other motor, sensory or psychic variants of epilepsy would rarely be considered a form of epilepsy even though its occurrence was episodic and paroxysmal.

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Backache is often persistent or recurrent. It is an indication for careful diagnostic history, physical examination, and adequate roentgenograms. Obesity and poor posture may be contributing causes. Other causes of backache should be considered in differential diagnosis. Backache of mechanical origin can be relieved in the vast majority of cases by suitable protective measures, by correction of obesity or faulty posture, by appropriate trunk-muscle exercises, and by training in good posture. Backache unrelieved by these treatments, especially if there is a severe structural defect, for example, spondylolysis, may be relieved by spine fusion. Sciatica is also a common cause of disability. Severe persistent sciatica is commonly due to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus with pressure against the adjacent nerve root, and it may be associated with neurological signs of nerve-root pressure. Tumor of the cauda equina is considered in differential diagnosis. Partial or temporary relief may be obtained by bed rest for two or three weeks if sciatica is due to mild nerve-root pressure. Severe or persistent sciatica due to extrusion of a nucleus pulposus is best relieved by careful surgical removal of the material causing the pressure. The best permanent results are obtained by removal of the entire nucleus pulposus. Spine fusion at the same time will relieve the backache that usually precedes and accompanies disc rupture and will correct structural weakness in the lumbosacral region. Careful evaluation of the patient, meticulous surgical technique, adequate postoperative care, and an appropriate convalescent regimen are essential for a high percentage of good or excellent results.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

It is the normal response to the distruption of healthy tissues, but its persistence beyond the period of healing should alert the practitioner to other unrecognized causes. On the other hand, learned pain is a condition resulting mainly from socio-emotional factors in the absence of progressive, invasive and, most of the time, demonstrable pathology. The key to success in the management of a painful condition is an accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate intervention and treatment. A complete history and a detailed physical examination, complemented by ancillary laboratory tests and consultations, when necessary, offer the best approach to initial management. This article discusses the pathophysiology of pain, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic interventions for evaluation and management of pain patients. The role of multiple factors as reinforcers of pain behavior deserves careful attention, and a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach may be indicated in selected cases.",

Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Primary headaches can be considered simultane- ously as symptom and disease itself, while secondary headaches are expressions of a pathological process that can be systemic or locoregional. Because of its subjective features, headache is often difficult to assess and quantify by severity, frequency and invalidity rate, and for these reasons it has often been implicated in legal controversies. Headache has seldom been considered in the criminal law, except when it represents a typical symptom of a disease whose existence can be objectively assessed (i.e. raised intracranial pressure). Therefore, in civil legislation it is not yet coded to start claiming for invalidity compensation. In particular, one of the most debated medical-legal ques- tions is represented by headaches occurring after head injury. Headache is often the principal symptom at the beginning of several toxic chronic syndromes, with many implications, especially in working claims, and, more recently, it may be referred to as one of the most frequent symptoms by victims of mobbing (i.e. psychological harassment in the workplace). The National Institute for Industrial Accident Insurance (INAIL) scales (instituted by the law 38/2000) mention the Subjective cranial trauma syndrome and give an invalidity rate evaluation. With ref- erence to other headache forms, no legislation really exists at the present time, and headache is only considered as a symptom of a certain coded disease. Requests for invalid- ity social pension and the question of off-label prescrip- tions (drug prescription for a disease, without formal indi- cation for it) are other controversial matters.",

The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

      "title": "Oral and Craniofacial Pain: Diagnosis, Pathophysiology, and Treatment",
      "abstract": "The craniofacial region constitutes one of the most common sites of pain in the human body. 1 The multiplicity and frequent interconnections of pain-sensitive structures in the face make it difficult to ascertain the source of pain. Pain is a complex phenomenon that comprises sensory-discriminative, cognitive, affective, and emotional aspects. 1 This fact renders the management of facial pain syndromes a clinical challenge. Thorough knowledge of the various clinical presentations of each disorder is essential for proper management as well as neuroanatomic and patho-physiological aspects of craniofacial pain. Oral medicine and dental treatment plays a pivotal role in delineating underlying pathology and thereby is essential for proper management. Headache can contribute to craniofacial pain in various clinical presentations, since a vast majority of headache disorders can be identified as the cause of craniofacial pain. Headache can be primary headache disorders, where the headache is the illness itself; this category includes migraine, tension-type headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, idiopathic intracranial hemicrania, and cluster headache. Secondary headache may be due to identifiable disorders or structural lesions, such as cervicogenic headache. Due to its breadth and complexity, primary headache is not discussed in this chapter. This chapter comprises the diagnosis, pathophysiology, investigations, and treatment of some of the common and significant etiologies of non-headache, craniofacial pain (Table 1).",

Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms.

Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs. For patient’s refractory to pharmacotherapy, neurosurgical decompression and nerve reconstruction and neuromodulation procedures are recommended to relieve neuropathic pain.

      "abstract": "Postconcussion syndrome is a poorly defined term that refers to the temporary symptoms that can follow a minor head injury. In the vast majority of cases, symptoms resolve within days or weeks. The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

It is a normal state and a spur to action, but readily exceeds normal limits in intensity, duration and appropriateness to the stimulus or situation. Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

A traumatic brain injury means that a sudden force has been applied to the brain from outside. But not every force causes a concussion. In fact, most do not. The scalp, skull, and dura do a pretty good job protecting our brains from most of what happens to us on a daily basis. A traumatic brain injury means that the force applied to the brain caused a disruption in the brain’s structure, an impairment of the brain’s function, or both. Just because a computed tomography (CT) scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or a blood test is negative does not mean that there has not been a concussion. Traumatic brain injury, especially concussion, is a clinical diagnosis, not based on any laboratory test or scan. Typically, patients with concussion have Glasgow Coma Scores between 13 and 15.",

Amongst the reasons for this are high rates of co-occurrence of different diagnostic constructs, which themselves are often polythetic in nature. People who meet criteria for a diagnostic construct may have little or even no clinical features in common. These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "abstract": "The content of thought, which emerges from the processing of information from the social context lived, is a critical factor that guides whether the behavior is psychopathological or not. In cases where worry, anxiety and fear are dominant in the content of thought, the individual may find himself in some psychopathological processes. Adversity and uncertainty are the main factors that lead to the experience of worry, anxiety and fear which is the last point of these. Uncertainty of information from the social context lived, when matched with adversity, may lead to chaotic situations at the cognitive level, e.g., thought contents such as distortions in thought, severe anxiety and fear. Obsessive compulsive disorder derives from severe worry and anxiety. Although the disorder is classified under anxiety disorders, it is actually a thought distortion disorder. The individual finds himself repeating the strange behavior patterns accompanied by strange thought contents in order to get rid of the severe anxiety and accelerated thought cycle he is exposed to. Ambiguity and uncertainty also may lead to the accelerated thought cycle, ruminations, severe thought distortions, over-generalizations. Ruminations, especially, impair the individual’s ability to think and process emotions gradually. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder will be discussed in terms of ambiguity and uncertainty with the combination of adversity. Positive Psychotherapy, which is one of the latest effective technique in recovery processes of the diseases, will be mentioned.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

The disability may be unrecognized or denied by the sufferer and may attract social stigma rather than sympathy from others. The effect on mental health is surprisingly neglected. Early studies of psychiatric patients suggested hearing impairment is an important cause of paranoid illness, but more recent studies of wider populations have failed to confirm this association. Hearing impairment is unrelated to intellect when controlled for age, but is an important differential diagnosis of dementia in the elderly. Evidence accumulates to suggest that the hearing impaired are vulnerable to depression, social stress and isolation, but reliable controlled studies of psychiatric sequelae are needed.",

      "title": "Un diagnostic \"psy\" invisible : le cas du trouble d'adaptation",
      "abstract": "Le trouble d'adaptation (TA) est un diagnostic defini par le DSM comme une reaction psychologique a un evenement de vie penible. Sa prevalence clinique est relativement elevee en premiere ligne medicale ou il fait parfois figure de diagnostic officieux de « depression mineure » et d' « epuisement professionnel ». Bien que le TA soit un diagnostic frequemment utilise en clinique medicale, il demeure relativement peu etudie. A peine une centaine de publications scientifiques abordent le diagnostic dans des revues savantes depuis son introduction en 1980. Un tel chiffre contraste avec les milliers d'etudes menees sur les autres diagnostics psychiatriques dont la prevalence est comparable, notamment la depression majeure. Cette faible attention scientifique portee au TA interpelle plusieurs chercheurs. La principale hypothese retenue jusqu'a maintenant pour expliquer ce phenomene est le caractere non specifique de la definition du TA qui entrainerait des obstacles methodologiques significatifs. Cependant, plusieurs autres attributs du diagnostic paraissent susceptibles de limiter son etude, dont sa nature relativement benigne vis-a-vis des autres troubles psychiatriques. Afin d'eclaircir les raisons derriere la faible attention scientifique portee au TA, nous avons procede a une analyse de contenu thematique de la litterature scientifique abordant specifiquement le diagnostic. Nous avons ainsi recolte cent quinze textes publies dans des revues savantes depuis trente ans ayant l'expression « trouble d'adaptation » dans leur titre. Apres categorisation des textes scientifiques et identification des principales dimensions substantives associees au TA, nous avons pu degager les principaux attributs du diagnostic susceptibles de repondre a notre question de recherche. Cette etude, qui propose un regard sociologique inedit sur le diagnostic du TA, laisse voir que la faible attention scientifique dont il est l'objet est le produit de plusieurs facteurs. D'abord, bien que defini par la psychiatrie, l'objet d'etude que represente TA se derobe vraisemblablement de cette specialite medicale par son profil phenomenologique mineur, par l'absence de substrat biologique associe ainsi que par l'approche pharmacotherapeutique minimale qu'on preconise a l'egard du diagnostic. Ensuite, l'ambiguite fondamentale qui caracterise le TA, le savoir tacite du DSM que requiert son etude ainsi que le benefice que le diagnostic retire d'une forme d'invisibilite contribuent aussi a reduire l'extension de la recherche a son endroit. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : trouble d'adaptation, diagnostic, depression, clinique, psychiatrie",

If an occupational health physician is aware of them, it is much easier for him to organize activities with the aim to prevent stress in the work environment. The determination of physiological reactions to chronic stressors may be useful in assessing stressogenic traits of various jobs, understanding morbid effect of stress and recognising persons oversensitive to occupational stress. Physiological examinations of traumatic stress render it possible to identify the mechanism responsible for the development of disorders resulting from traumatic stress, provide indicators for an objective diagnosis of this disorders and help to distinguish and assess their long-term effects which may persist after a subsidence of acute symptoms.",

Pode ser primária, quando é a patologia em si, ou secundária, quando representa um sintoma de outra patologia estrutural. Objetivo: Apresentar uma síntese das informações mais relevantes sobre a cefaleia tensional. Material e Método: Foi realizada uma revisão em livros e bases de dados eletrônicos, tendo como critério de inclusão artigos tidos como de grande relevância, publicados em português, inglês ou espanhol. Resultados: Destaca-se entre as primárias, a cefaleia tipo tensional, caracterizada por sensações dolorosas de caráter compressivo, leves ou moderadas, nas regiões frontal, parietal, temporal e/ou occipital, bilateralmente. É subclassificada de acordo com sua duração em episódica pouco frequente, episódica frequente e crônica. Sua fisiopatologia é complexa e envolve mecanismos periféricos e centrais de gênese da dor, devendo ser diferenciada de outros tipos de cefaleia. Exibe diversos fatores desencadeantes, em especial os de ordem psicológica, que na maioria dos casos podem ser evitados como forma de prevenção. Sua terapêutica pode ser farmacológica ou não, agindo de forma abortiva e/ou profilática. Conclusão: A cefaleia tensional, embora muito prevalente, é subdiagnosticada, geralmente pela falta de conhecimento de médicos generalistas, fato que pode resultar em adoção de planos terapêuticos indevidos e, consequentemente, culminar em prejuízo na qualidade de vida dos doentes. Este distúrbio é passível de prevenção, com mudanças de hábitos a fim de se minimizar ou extinguir fatores desencadeantes.Descritores: Cefaleia; Cefaleia do Tipo Tensional; Manifestações Neurológicas.",

Studies of this problem explicitly show that the loss of the job exerts a detrimental health effect. A number of other factors decide about the significance of this relationship. The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

It must be considered, however, that in many cases the early manifestations may not reveal the seriousness of the lesion fully and may be misleading. On the other hand, the first symptoms may indicate a more grave condition than the subsequent history will confirm. The early symptom most generally observed in serious head injuries is a state of unconsciousness. What this may signify can not always easily be determined from the symptom alone. The question of importance in this connection to be considered at an early moment is, whether the unconsciousness is from hemorrhage, or from concussion or contusion of the brain.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human suffering is multidimensional. Pain, an important but not sole cause of suffering, has its own complex network of sensors throughout the body, which send nerve signals to the brain. This network can become more or less sensitive to pain in response to the guidance of our brain. Physical pain is therefore a kind of motivator for behavior, at the same time that it is shaped by our emotions and thoughts. Disturbances of the brain, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are also potent sources of suffering. These psychiatric conditions are associated with changes in brain chemistry, hormone balance, and genetic expression physically, as well as deficits in social support and family life. The pain of social exclusion is expressed through the same brain circuits that mediate physical pain. This insight into the unity of emotional and physical suffering may help guide researchers, doctors, and caregivers who seek to ameliorate suffering.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

Mobbing, defined as repeated psychological harassment in the workplace, is a prolonged process rather than a single incident. Those subjected to mobbing often exhibit various physical and psychological symptoms. Numerous studies in the literature indicate that mobbing can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma, characterized by its sudden onset and life-threatening impact, significantly harms individuals. This review focuses on the psychological issues arising from PTSD due to mobbing, highlighting conditions such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, and PTSD itself. The loss of self-confidence and self-esteem observed in mobbing victims can exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to suicidal tendencies. Research findings indicate alarmingly high rates of these outcomes, underscoring the severe impact of mobbing on mental health.",

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

      "title": "Stress Response Analysis via Dynamic Entropy in EEG: Caregivers in View",
      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress can be defined as any type of alteration that causes physical, emotional, or psychological tension. A very important concept that is sometimes confused with stress is anxiety. The difference between stress and anxiety is that stress usually has an existing cause. Once that activator has passed, stress typically eases. In this respect, according to the American Psychiatric Association, anxiety is a normal response to stress and can even be advantageous in some circumstances. By contrast, anxiety disorders differ from temporary feelings of anxiousness or nervousness with more intense feelings of fear or anxiety. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) explicitly describes anxiety as exorbitant concern and fearful expectations, occurring on most days for at least 6 months, about a series of events. Stress can be measured by some standardized questionnaires; however, these resources are characterized by some major disadvantages, the main one being the time consumed to interpret them; i.e., qualitative information must be transformed to quantitative data. Conversely, a physiological recourse has the advantage that it provides quantitative spatiotemporal information directly from brain areas and it processes data faster than qualitative supplies. A typical option for this is an electroencephalographic record (EEG). We propose, as a novelty, the application of time series (TS) entropies developed by us to inspect collections of EEGs obtained during stress situations. We investigated this database related to 23 persons, with 1920 samples (15 s) captured in 14 channels for 12 stressful events. Our parameters reflected that out of 12 events, event 2 (Family/financial instability/maltreatment) and 10 (Fear of disease and missing an important event) created more tension than the others. In addition, the most active lobes reflected by the EEG channels were frontal and temporal. The former is in charge of performing higher functions, self-control, self monitoring, and the latter is in charge of auditory processing, but also emotional handling. Thus, events E2 and E10 triggering frontal and temporal channels revealed the actual state of participants under stressful situations. The coefficient of variation revealed that E7 (Fear of getting cheated/losing someone) and E11 (Fear of suffering a serious illness) were the events with more changes among participants. In the same sense, AF4, FC5, and F7 (mainly frontal lobe channels) were the most irregular on average for all participants. In summary, by means of dynamic entropy analysis, the goal is to process the EEG dataset in order to elucidate which event and brain regions are key for all participants. The latter will allow us to easily determine which was the most stressful and on which brain zone. This study can be applied to other caregivers datasets. All this is a novelty.",

The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a common, serious neurological disease, with prevalence of 1% and a cumulative lifetime risk of 5%. An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Unlike epileptic seizures, PNES do not result from an abnormal electrical discharge from the brain; they are a physical manifestation of a psychological disturbance. We present an interesting case of PNES with pseudo-ventricular tachycardia due to body movement related artefacts. A careful analysis of the whole 12-lead electrocardiogram is required to rule out an artefact-related appearance of ventricular tachycardia. Correct interpretation of electrocardiograms and their co-relation to clinical history and presentation is key.",

Prevalence rates for the assorted conditions vary considerably but the most reliable estimates are greater than 50% for strokes involving the somatosensory system, brachial plexus avulsions, spinal cord injury, and limb amputation, with controversy surrounding the mechanistic contributions of deafferentation to ensuing neuropathic pain syndromes. Deafferentation pain has also been described for loss of other body parts (e.g., eyes and breasts) and may contribute to between 10% and upwards of 30% of neuropathic symptoms in peripheral neuropathies. There is no pathognomonic test or sign to identify deafferentation pain, and part of the controversy surrounding it stems from the prodigious challenges in differentiating cause and effect. For example, it is unknown whether cortical reorganization causes pain or is a byproduct of pathoanatomical changes accompanying injury, including pain. Similarly, ascertaining whether deafferentation contributes to neuropathic pain, or whether concomitant injury to nerve fibers transmitting pain and touch sensation leads to a deafferentation-like phenotype can be clinically difficult, although a detailed neurologic examination, functional imaging, and psychophysical tests may provide clues. Due in part to the concurrent morbidities, the physical, psychologic, and by extension socioeconomic costs of disorders associated with deafferentation are higher than for other chronic pain conditions. Treatment is symptom-based, with evidence supporting first-line antineuropathic medications such as gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Studies examining noninvasive neuromodulation and virtual reality have yielded mixed results.",

Le traumatisme craniocerebral (TCC) implique un coup plus ou moins violent a la tete et il peut se produire a divers moments et dans divers lieux : accident de la route ou au travail ou encore lors d'une activite de loisir ou d'une activite sportive. Il y a trois niveaux : le TCC leger, modere et grave. Les deux dernieres categories (TCC modere et grave) impliquent un coma plus ou moins long et le reveil est souvent compare a une deuxieme naissance ou l'on doit tout reapprendre. Souvent, le TCC est caracterise par des sequelles persistantes qui ont la particularite d'etre invisibles. Ainsi, les proches et les ami(e)s et aussi les autres personnes rencontrees peuvent avoir de la difficulte a saisir les changements causes par le TCC ; ceci peut laisser place a de la stigmatisation. Nous avons fait des entretiens semi-diriges avec des personnes ayant survecu a un TCC modere ou grave pour pouvoir les questionner sur leur experience de vie a leur retour a la vie « normale ». Le handicap est le theme central de notre recherche, et a l'aide du modele du Processus de production du handicap (PPH) propose par Fougeyrollas et al. (1998), nous avons observe l'importance du role des facteurs personnels (sequelles) et surtout de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux (famille, ami(e)s, organismes et institutions, etc.) sur la reduction ou l'augmentation des habitudes de vie (situation de handicap). Pour faire la demonstration que la personne ayant survecu a un TCC n'est pas un acteur passif face a sa situation de handicap, nous avons utilise le concept « d'agir » propose par Hurtubise et Roy (2007). Cela a permis d'illustrer les diverses strategies qu'utilise une personne vivant avec un TCC pour faire face aux differents obstacles. Nous avons identifie cinq types d'actions : l'evitement, la paralysie, la contrainte, le bricolage et la tactique. Toutes les personnes de notre recherche n'ont pas fait un retour a leur vie d'avant l'accident mais ils ont tous trouve de nouvelles habitudes de vie adaptees a leur situation ; plusieurs doivent et devront faire face a des obstacles en lien avec le TCC.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : traumatisme crânien, handicap invisible, liminalite, agir, stigmatisation",

Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner.

These psycho-behavioral manifestations can be isolated, coexist, or complicate a neurological deficit, thus raising questions about their imputability. Our goal is to shed light on the extent to which cranial traumas contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders and their specific characteristics. Ultimately, we aim to establish the foundations for an optimal biopsychosocial and legislative management approach if necessary. This will be illustrated through the clinical case of a patient who exhibited depressive symptoms shortly after the onset of delusional ideas with a psychotic nature, one year after experiencing a cranial trauma due to a public road accident. The somatic consequences of cranial trauma can cause psychotic symptoms. This is referred to as a post-traumatic psychotic disorder directly linked to localized brain damage, adhering to the structure-function paradigm. Such symptoms can appear up to four years later. The authors have reported that the onset of psychotic symptoms is frequently associated with depressive syndrome, which is a factor contributing to the chronicization of post-traumatic psychosis. Psychotic symptoms following Psychotic manifestations, such as delusions and hallucinations, can occur in various psychiatric and somatic disorders, especially neurological and neurosurgical conditions. These behaviors can occur alone, work in conjunction, or complicate a neurological deficit, raising questions about their connection to the condition.

      "title": "CHRONIC PAIN IN SURVIVORS OF TORTURE – Psyche or Soma?",
      "abstract": "Persistent pain related to the musculo-skeletal system is the most frequent reported physical complaint in survivors of torture. In spite of a long-standing tradition of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, however, there is no consensus on how chronic pain and pain-related disability are best addressed within this clinical practice. Are pain problems in torture survivors to be viewed as a somatic problem and intensively investigated and managed as such, or assumed to be the presentation/concomitant of psychological disturbance such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other trauma-related problem? The current paper is intended as an overview of chronic pain in torture survivors viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate theoretical models of pain. According to these models pain should be viewed not as the result of either solely physical or solely psychological causes, but rather as a set of bio-physiological, psychosocial and behavioural factors contributing to the total experience of pain. Consequently, appropriate assessment of chronic pain requires assessment of more than just the direct components of pain. Given the complexity inherent in the construct of subjective pain, there is a need to obtain a diversity of assessment information that must then be integrated to understand the individuals’ pain and to contribute to treatment decision-making. Overemphasising the importance of psychological aspects, however, may result in insufficient somatic pain diagnoses and reduced treatment efficacy. Basic knowledge of the physiology of pain is therefore a prerequisite when assessing, diagnosing, and managing individuals suffering from chronic pain conditions. A brief introduction to the physiology of pain has therefore been enclosed in this paper, focusing on chronic, persistent pain and the pain signalling system under abnormal conditions. Possible pain generating mechanisms in chronic post-torture pain are highlighted and how to use clinical information and an understanding of pain classification to identify these mechanisms. Clinically, a failure to appreciate the intricacies of the relation and co-occurrence of trauma-related problems and chronic pain carries a risk of poor clinical decision-making, selection for treatment, and design of therapeutic intervention. It is advocated that chronic post-torture pain should be viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate models of pain and stress, and that knowledge-based clinical guidelines for the assessment and interdisciplinary management emphasising biomedical, behavioural, and cognitive aspects of chronic pain and pain-associated disability in torture survivors should be developed based on these models.",

      "title": "Suicide in Severe Depression: A Longitudinal Case-Control Study",
      "abstract": "Popular Abstract in Swedish Popularvetenskaplig sammanfattning Personer som ar deprimerade loper storre risk att bega sjalvmord an de som har andra psykiska storningar. Studier har visat att cirka 6-15% av alla patienter med affektiv sjukdom begar sjalvmord. Vidare har det visat sig att cirka halften av alla manniskor som tar livet av sig har haft en depression. Man har darfor sokt efter riskfaktorer inom depressionsgruppen. Sjalvmordsforsok ar den viktigaste kliniska riskfaktorn for deprimerade likaval som for andra grupper. Man har ocksa funnit skillnader mellan sjalvmordsfall och kontroller betraffande symptom, sociala bakgrundsfaktorer, personlighet och biologiska markorer. Somnloshet, tidig foraldraforlust, att leva ensam och for kvinnor histrionisk personlighet ar exempel pa riskfaktorer, liksom laga halter av ett amne i ryggmargsvatskan (5-HIAA). Sjalvmord foregas ofta av forsok och dessa ar i sin tur foregangna av sjalvmordstankar. Man har darfor talat om en sjalvmordsprocess, dar yttre pafrestningar leder till hopploshet, sjalvmordstankar, sjalvmordsforsok, som upprepas och blir allvarligare till sin karaktar och slutligen fullbordat sjalvmord. Samtidigt ar det endast en minoritet av alla som har sjalvmordstankar, som gor sjalvmordsforsok och av dessa i sin tur endast ett fatal som sa smaningom tar livet av sig, cirka 10-15%. Det ar darfor angelaget att urskilja vilka patienter med sjalvmordsforsok, som ar i riskzonen for fullbordat sjalvmord sa smaningom. Jamforelser mellan dem som gjort allvarliga eller upprepade forsok har inte givit entydiga resultat. Daremot har man kunnat identifiera riskfaktorer pa lang och kort sikt. Depressioner ar forenade med okad dodlighet aven i somatiska sjukdomar, och en fragestallning for avhandlingen har varit om denna okade risk kvarstar sent i forloppet och om sjalvmordsrisken forblir densamma. Slutligen uppstar fragan om gangse somatiska behandlingar, antidepressiv medicin och elektrisk behandling, som ar sa effektiva vid depressionsbehandling, ocksa kan forebygga sjalvmord. Ett flertal studier, men inte alla, har visat att deprimerade patienter som tagit livet av sig ofta inte fatt tillracklig behandling. Kontrollerade studier har emellertid inte kunnat pavisa nagon klar skillnad som tyder pa forebyggande effekt av antidepressiv terapi med mediciner eller el-behandling. Kombinationen av elbehandling och uppfoljande antidepressiv medicinering har inte undersokts i tillrackligt stora material for att kunna pavisa nagon skillnad. Denna avhandling behandlar djupa depressioner/melankoli. Den utgar fran de multiaxiala skattningar som gjordes av inneliggande patienter pa psykiatriska klinken under 50- och 60-talen. Under denna tid fick 1206 patienter den namnda diagnosen (506 man och 700 kvinnor). Vid en forsta uppfoljning 1984 hade 103 patienter tagit livet av sig. Av dessa utvaldes de som hade en primar depression, alltsa ingen tidigare diagnos, for undersokning. Darvid ingick 89 patienter i studien (38 man och 51 kvinnor). Lika manga kontroller ur samma material utvaldes matchade for kon, alder och forsta inlaggningsar med diagnosen. En blind genomgang av journalerna gjordes med skattningar av en rad variabler, som sjalvmordsbeteende, behandling m m. I en andra omgang gjordes en uppfoljning av dodligheten hos samma patienter fran 1984-1998. Da hade ytterligare 14 patienter tagit livet av sig (8 man och 3 kvinnor). Avhandlingen har behandlat riskfaktorer, utveckling av sjalvmordsbeteende, sen dodlighet (efter 15 ar och mer) samt behandling vid sjalvmordet. Studie 1 Sprod/sensitiv personlighet och hereditet for psykos var relaterade till sjalvmord i den manliga gruppen. I den kvinnliga gruppen var sjalvmordsoffren oftare ensamstaende, negativa till behandling och hade oftare gjort sjalvmordsforsok. Nagot ovantat hade kontrollerna oftare haft en disharmonisk uppvaxt och hade oftare en fysisk sjukdom. Detta kan tyda pa att de som begick sjalvmord var mera sarbara an de andra. Studie 2 Livsleda, dodsonskan, sjalvmordstankar och planer skilde inte mellan dem som begick sjalvmord och kontroller. Daremot var livsleda relaterat till sjalvmord for man med sprod/sensitiv personlighet och ”tvingande” sjalvmordstankar for man med psykos. Det var vanligare att kvinnor tog livet av sig utan att ha kommunicerat sjalvmordstankar eller gjort sjalvmordsforsok an det var for man. Studie 3 Sjalvmordsforsok predicerade som vantat for sjalvmord. Det galler for man som bara haft depressioner och for kvinnor som aven haft skov av forhojd sinnesstamning. Sjalvmordsforsokens karaktar, som metod, svarighetsgrad och upprepning skilde inte mellan sjalvmord och kontroller och kan darfor inte sagas oka risken. Daremot borjade kvinnor som senare tog livet av sig oftare med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok jamfort med sina kontroller. Stressande livshandelser var ungefar lika vanliga fore det forsta sjalvmordsforsoket hos sjalvmord och kontroller. De senare gjorde emellertid oftare upprepade och svara forsok efter utlosande handelser. Dessutom var handelserna oftare allvarliga i kontrollgruppen. Detta tyder an en gang pa en storre sarbarhet hos dem som senare begar sjalvmord. Dessa gor istallet fler upprepade forsok ju fler depressiva skov de far. Tva sjalvmordsprocesser kan beskrivas i den kvinnliga gruppen: 1. En sjalvmordskarriar som ofta borjar med ett allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och darfor inte uppvisar nagon okning i svarighetsgrad; upprepade forsok relaterade till depressionsforloppet snarare an yttre handelser. Denna karriar slutar ofta med fullbordat sjalvmord. 2. En karriar som borjar med ett mindre allvarligt sjalvmordsforsok och senare i forloppet uppvisar allvarliga forsok, ofta utlosta av yttre handelser. Denna karriar har ofta god prognos. Den sjalvmordsprocess som beskrivits i litteraturen fanns saledes hos kontrollerna! Detta ar faktiskt inte orimligt eftersom tidigare studier gjorts pa personer som gjort sjalvmordsforsok av vilka de flesta overlever och saledes kan forvantas likna vara kontroller. Studie 4 Dodligheten sent i forloppet var okad i andningsorganens sjukdomar, sjalvmord och osakra sjalvmord for man och okad for alla orsaker sammanlagt och sjalvmord for kvinnor. Sjalvmord ar dock mindre vanligt sent jamfort med tidigare i forloppet. Man begar oftare an kvinnor sjalvmord sent i forloppet. Denna skillnad fanns inte tidigare vid en undersokning av samma material. Den totala dodligheten i sjalvmord ar hittills 10%, alltsa nagot hogre an de 6%som nyligen kalkylerats for depressioner i allmanhet (inte sa djupa som dessa). Den hogsta risken for sjalvmord foreligger i de yngre aldersgrupperna for bade man och kvinnor, medan kvinnor visar en ny topp mellan 50 och 60. Studie 5 Behandling vid sista kontakten fore sjalvmordet undersoktes och jamfordes med kontrollernas. Darvid delade vi upp sjalvmorden i dem som hade kontakt med kliniken i samband med sin sista depression fore sjalvmordet, dvs inom sex manader, da behandlingen kunde tankas ha effekt. Det visade sig att det inte fanns nagon skillnad i behandling mellan sjalvmord och kontroller ifraga om medicinering med antidepressiva eller elbehandling. Inte heller fanns det nagon skillnad i svar pa behandling i form av forbattring. Daremot hade kontroller som fatt elbehandling oftare fatt antidepressiva som uppfoljning. Detta tyder pa att uppfoljning med medicinering efter el-behandling kan forebygga sjalvmord. (Less)",

Sebenarnya nyeri ini, seperti halnya nyeri yang lain, hanyalah suatu gejala subjektif yang menandai adanya penyakit /gangguan di sekitar daerah tersebut. Nyeri sebenarnya adalah suatu sensasi yang sangat tidak menyenangkan, bahkan kadang-kadang mengganggu aktivitas seseorang. Karena nyerilah orang merasa cemas dan terdorong mencari pertolongan profesional.\r\nOleh penderita, nyeri biasa dikemukakan dengan berbagai istilah, antara lain nyeri menusuk, nyeri tajam, nyeri berdenyut, nyeri tumpul, nyeri di permukaan, nyeri di dalam, dan masih banyak lagi yang lain. Persepsi pasien tentang nyeri sangat dipengaruhi oleh berbagai macam faktor, seperti emosi, pengalamannya tentang nyeri, sosiobudaya, dan masih banyak lagi faktor yang mungkin berpengaruh. Karena itu sering kali nyeri sulit dideteksi sumbernya, lebih-lebih jika nyeri itu bersifat tumpul dan dalam, dan perawatannya menjadi tidak terarah.\r\nPada kesempatan ini akan dibahas secara singkat NOF ini, khususnya yang terkait dengan masalah disfungsi sendi temporomandibula (STM), karena masalah ini sering dijumpai dalam praktik sehari-hari dokter gigi. Harapannya, dapat membuka wawasan para sejawat menghadapi pasien dengan masalah tersebut di atas.",

In this labor are shown the consequences of stress experiences on children, for example a serious threats to life, natural catastrophies (e.g. earthquake) and violent events. The results of traumatic events on emotional state or behavior of child may be short term or long term, anyway they affect development. Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

The first, more traditionally biomedical is that the paralysis originates from some demonstrable pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system; the second does not fulfil this criterion and the paralysis can be broadly considered as an ‘unexplained medical symptom’ or, more specifically, as an ‘unexplained neurological symptom’ (Brown and Ron 2002). Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established. On the other hand, no underlying structural pathology may be",

There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania.

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

Tan solo cuando sobrepasa cierta intensidad o supera la capacidad adaptativa de la persona, es cuando la ansiedad se convierte en patologica y provoca malestar significativo con sintomas que afectan tanto al plano fisico, como al psicologico y conductual. Los trastornos de ansiedad son mas frecuentes que cualquier otro tipo de alteracion psiquiatrica. No obstante, a menudo pasan desapercibidos y, por tanto, no se tratan. Se realiza este manual con el objetivo de brindar a los medicos de la atencion primaria de salud recursos que le permitan establecer el diagnostico de los trastornos ansiosos, asi como indicar una terapeutica adecuada, mediante la utilizacion de algoritmos diagnosticos, que permiten identificar las manifestaciones psicopatologicas de cada forma clinica y su conducta farmacologica psicologica.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The absence statuses, which manifest themselves clinically as a simple dullness of consciousness, constitute only a part of the episodic psychic disturbances accompanying the generalized protracted spike and wave discharges. In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses. RÉSUMÉ Les états 'absence, qui cliniquement se manifestent par une simple obnubilation de la conscience, ne constituent qu'une partie des troubles psychiques qui accompagnent les décharges généralises et prolongées de complexes pointe‐onde. Dans 'autres cas, et en particulier quand les décharges sont plus atypiques, les manifestations psychiques peuvent revêtir 'aspect 'un simple trouble du comportement, ou 'un état confusionnel avec agitation et onirisme, ou encore 'aspect 'un état de stupeur.

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness.

Factors related to the analyst's character and current developmental stage further color unavoidable fears. Clinical vignettes are used illustratively.

      "title": "The Behavioural Dimension of Brain Disorders-An Area for Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine with a relatively short history. Although mental illness has probably existed throughout the history of mankind, it has received little attention from the medical perspective. Major psychoses have been considered as either spiritual or functional until recently. The functional or organic dichotomy has been the official watershed dividing the disciplines of Neurology and Psychiatry. While Neurology follows the basic medical approach, Psychiatry takes a much broader, and perhaps more diffuse, perspective. During the past few decades, there has been a quantum leap in the volume of basic neuroscientific research. A much better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying most, if not all, psychiatric disorders has led to a revolutionary change in the concept of mental disorders. Most functional or psychogenic problems have now been found to have an 'organic' aetiology. Functional psychiatric disorders are much better perceived as medical disorders leading to disturbances in brain function. Clinical manifestations are disturbances of the integration between mood, perception, and thought processes. The old distinction between diseases as either neurological or psychiatric faces challenges to its validity. It would be over-simplistic to assume that brain disorders will manifest either along the neurological or psychiatric dimension, and be managed with a single approach. In this issue, the significance of a combined neuropsychiatric approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders is highlighted. The article on depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in this classical neurological disorder. (1) Discovery of degeneration of the dopaminergic system in this disorder led to the development of an associated treatment. It is well-recognised that PD is readily amenable to pharmacological interventions that bolster dopaminergic transmission. Nevertheless, the focusing of attention on the motor symptoms of PD is associated with a neglect of other important determinants of quality of life, such as depressive disorders and other psychopathology. The report on mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) provides an excellent example of the complex neuropsychiatric manifestations of a rare metabolic brain disease. (2) In MELAS, a combination of neurological and psychiatric symptomatology, and use of sophisticated neuroimaging and laboratory technology are required to make the diagnosis. It is perhaps meaningless to argue about the importance of paying dual attention to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of brain disorders. A more intriguing question may be the need for a division between Psychiatry and Neurology, or more specifically, the distinction between Behavioural Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. …",

There is a possibility that in many cases diagnosed primarily as \"mental disorder,\" \"hysteria\" or other \"emotional disturbance,\" a hidden factor of prophyria exists, which can be easily determined by laboratory testing. It is needless to state that this evaluation could be beneficial in the successful diagnosis and treatment of some patients now in mental hospitals.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a term that is readily recognized by everyone but defines rigorous scientific definition. It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

Extrinsic sleep disorders are caused by transient stress or disruptions in the sleep environment. Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

      "title": "Fear conditioning to socially relevant stimuli in social anxiety",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos de ansiedad constituyen un reto para la psiquiatria y la psicologia clinica. Cerca de un 30% de la poblacion sufre, o ha sufrido, uno o mas trastornos de ansiedad a lo largo de su vida, siendo dicho grupo de trastornos el mas frecuente dentro del DSM-IV. Las aproximaciones teoricas basadas en los modelos de aprendizaje aversivo han ocupado un lugar muy importante entre los modelos etiologicos de dichos trastornos. A pesar de que el condicionamiento del miedo es un proceso adaptativo y de gran importancia para la supervivencia, puede acabar convirtiendose en clinicamente relevante cuando la reactividad al Estimulo Condicionado (EC) persiste en ausencia de contingencia entre el EC y el Estimulo Incondicionado (EI). Mediante procesos de condicionamiento clasico aversivo pueda aparecer un trastorno de ansiedad durante o despues de un acontecimiento traumatico o en un periodo de estres significativo. Sin embargo, no todas las personas expuestas a este tipo de sucesos acaban desarrollando un trastorno. Algunos estudios han demostrado un mayor condicionamiento y una mayor resistencia a la extincion en pacientes ansiosos comparados con controles sanos sugiriendo que pacientes con trastornos de ansiedad se caracterizan por una elevada condicionabilidad y que esta es una de las razones por las que, en situaciones de exposicion a incidentes aversivos, solo algunos individuos desarrollan miedos patologicos, mientras que otros muestran una respuesta adaptativa de miedo. La mayoria de estudios han utilizado el reflejo de sobresalto como indice de procesamiento afectivo. Consiste en una respuesta defensiva subita que presentan muchas especies animales ante un estimulo intenso e inesperado. En humanos, puede ser medido de forma bastante sencilla registrando la respuesta electromiografica en el musculo orbicularis oculi. El incremento del reflejo de sobresalto cuando un individuo esta experimentando un estado de miedo o ansiedad se denomina reflejo de sobresalto potenciado por miedo. Durante los ultimos anos, este se ha convertido en una herramienta de gran utilidad para la investigacion traslacional de los trastornos de ansiedad. La mayor parte de los trabajos han utilizado estimulos evolutivamente poco “preparados” y algunos no han demostrado mayor condicionabilidad en pacientes con trastornos de ansiedad. Esto nos alerta de la necesidad de emplear paradigmas que contemplen estimulos incondicionados mas relevantes para el trastorno objeto de estudio. Por tanto, el objetivo general del presente proyecto fue investigar el papel del condicionamiento aversivo de estimulos socialmente relevantes como factor especifico de vulnerabilidad a la fobia social, utilizando el reflejo de sobresalto en pacientes con fobia social respecto a pacientes con trastorno de panico con agorafobia y controles sanos. Para llevarlo a cabo, se empleo un paradigma de condicionamiento diferencial desarrollado por Lissek et al. (2008) en el que imagenes de personas con una expresion facial neutra (EC) se aparearon con tres tipos de estimulos visuales/auditivos: insultos y expresiones faciales de critica (EIneg); comentarios y expresiones faciales neutras (EIneu); y cumplidos y expresiones faciales positivas (EIpos). Los resultados del presente trabajo no demostraron una mayor condicionabilidad en pacientes con fobia social respecto a pacientes con trastorno de panico con agorafobia y controles sanos. Es posible que otros procesos tanto asociativos (por ejemplo, extincion del miedo) como no asociativos (por ejemplo, procesos cognitivos y atencionales) tengan un papel mas importante en la fobia social que un mayor condicionamiento.",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions. What brings these together is their clinical similarity and probable disinhibition at higher brainstem levels.",

Different psychological and psychotherapeutic modalities for their management were discussed. The results of the study suggest that dental practitioners must know and use such modalities, and, if unable to deal with anxiety states, require consultation with psychotherapist. Pain is a universal syndrome in human pathology. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) pain is an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience primarily associated with tissue damage or described in terms of tissue damage. The subjective sensation of pain can be generated by stimulation of nociceptors; the sensation can be experienced even in the absence of pain. Pain is not only a sensory experience it is also an emotional experience. As a distress factor it can trigger different anxiety states. 1,2,6",

Anxiety and Depression are one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases. These diseases causes physical and pathological changes in the body, oral cavity not being a exception. Since oral mucosa is extremely reactive to emotional influences like stress, anxiety and depression; oral diseases may arise as a direct expression of emotions, or indirect result of psychological alterations [1]. The mouth is a window to body’s health and oral health state can offer lot of clues about the overall health and sometimes the first sign of a disease shows up in mouth. So there is need to learn more about the intimate connection between oral and overall health. Thus this review highlights the significance of increasing psychological factors in society resulting in altered physiological responses causing orofacial region pathologies, struggles in handling such patients and challenging treatment plans with highly important role played by recognition of such patients with role of counseling and early referral in patients to psychiatrist [2].",

It presents a small series of neurological patients with severe emotional disturbances. Even in cases where an organic aetiology is indisputable, physiological factors can only be invoked to explain somatic symptoms and the physiological correlates of mental symptoms. The mental symptoms themselves can only be understood psychologically. There can be no doubt that mental phenomena are somehow related to physical and chemical processes. A moment's reflection reveals the futility of seeking the cause of a suicidal melancholia, for example, in a CT scan. A scan or an angiogram, or whatever, can only reveal the cause of the stroke. A stroke therefore has different psychological implications for different patients, who have different resources available for dealing with them.",

      "title": "Psychogenic movement disorders: Past developments, current status, and future directions",
      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

In most cases, low back pain has a good prognosis, but the condition is often the source of much frustration for clinicians, patients and employers. The family physician should be able to treat the patient's symptoms and address the psychosocial issues that frequently complicate recovery. Three decision points, based on the history and physical examination, allow the physician to determine the severity of illness and implement an appropriate treatment plan. These three points are as follows: Is it likely that systemic disease or bone pathology is the cause of pain? Has neurologic compromise occurred? Are social or psychologic stressors present that may prolong the clinical course?",

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse. These six clinical findings include: the presence of a high-risk disorder or illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; age regression, flashbacks, abreactions, or other re-experiencing of the trauma; repetitions, repetition compulsions, or reenactments; characteristics of the memories themselves; and other patterns, dynamics, and connections. This framework can serve as a useful and clinical paradigm for all illnesses, including the addictive disorders.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic. Such designations are certainly open to question. However, they have prevailed, and ought to be retained. They do not indicate that this type of epilepsy has no cause but that, according to the expression of Castaigne (1968), in the case question epilepsy is the very essence of the disease, and",

The good physician cannot abandon his charges at this point, but he must study these obstacles and assist in surmounting them. He must match modern drug and surgical therapy with practical sociopsychological therapy. The good physician is concerned not only with turbulent brain waves but with disturbed emotions and with social injustice, for the epileptic is not just a nervemuscle preparation; he is a person, in health an integrated combination of the physical, the mental, the social, and the spiritual.

For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status.

Delirium is a transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment and other behavioral and psychological phenomena, with a relatively rapid onset and a characteristically fluctuating course. Though it is a common disease, it is frequently missed or misdiagnosed, which leads to a substantial attendant morbidity and mortality potential. Often delirium is due to multiple simultaneous causes, each one of which may or may not be enough to cause delirium by itself. We report a case of delirium accompanied by ataxia, depression and psychotic symptoms in a 72 year-old man with atrial fibrillation and intermittent trifascicular block. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigation allows underlying causes to be detected and treated. Clinical experience requires, therefore, to think of the crisis with a view to the difficult effort of composition and synthesis of a plurality of factors of various kinds (biological, psychological, and interpersonal). Those factors intervene in acute psychosis at different times and with different specific weights.",

The pains are assumed to be due to locally limited epileptic discharges in areas of the cortex where the digestive tract is represented. When the neuronal discharges reach other brain formations, multisymptomatic, partial or generalized epileptic seizures occur. In such cases, therefore, the abdominal symptomatology is either a first stage or a rudiment of a more complex course of attack, and should not be considered as the expression of a particular form of epilepsy that might be termed abdominal epilepsy. Difficulties regarding differential diagnosis ensue in the case of migraine with abdominal symptomatology. The latter should be taken into account when relapsing attacks of abdominal pain, which cannot be explained gastroenterologically, persist for hours and alternate with headache. In case of doubt, a family history of migraine confirms the diagnosis.",

Chronic pain localized to the abdomen, groin, and/or perineum can have multiple etiologies ranging from focal sites of inflammation to idiopathic systemic diseases. Pain experienced in the abdomen, groin, and/or perineum may arise from pathology of the nervous system innervating those structures or may originate in the viscera, vascular structures or musculoskeletal-articular stuctures in the region. Other sources of chronic abdominal visceral pain as well as urogenital and rectal pain syndromes producing groin and perineal symptomatology all have correlates with these disorders and diagnostic work-ups and therapies are similar. Chronic pain with abdominal, groin, or perineal localization is a common clinical entity with multiple etiologies both known and unknown. Numerous other painful disorders with abdominal, groin, or perineal symptomatology will then briefly be discussed as \"correlates\" of the archetypal disorders.",

Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "title": "Depression and Anxiety: Disorders of Emotion or Cognition?",
      "abstract": "Based on developments in emotion theory, Barlow presents a model of psychopathological disorders that is both exciting and broad in its theoretical scope. He suggests that disorders of anxiety and depression (as well as anger and mania) are fundamentally disorders and that they have their origins in the inappropriate and spontaneous firing of certain primitive, basic, negative emotions such as fear (panic in its clinical manifestation) and sadness, respectively, in individuals who are biologically overreactive to stressful life events. These spontaneously firing negative emotions or false alarms occur unpredictably; when they do, they may become the focus of perceptions of uncontrollability among individuals who are also psychologically vulnerable to the development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Thus, those persons who possess an overreactive neurobiological response to stressful life events as well as early experiences with lack of control will be likely to develop clinically significant episodes of anxiety or depression when triggered by unexpected bouts of these negative emotions. In Barlow's view, then, anxiety and depressive disorders share common biological and psychological diatheses as well as a common mediating mechanism, perceptions of uncontrollability over bouts of panic or sadness and the development of anxious apprehension about one's ability to cope with future threats. What determines whether a person becomes anxious and remains so, or also develops depression, is the degree of his or her psychological vulnerability, the severity of current stressors, and the availability of coping mechanisms. According to Barlow, whereas the anxious individual continues to try to cope, the depressed individual has given up. In this commentary, I question Barlow's assumption that anxiety and depressive disorders are fundamentally disorders. In addition, I evaluate Barlow's model of emotional disorders with specific reference to the model's ability to account for the relationship between anxiety and depression. In so doing, I compare Barlow's model to another, more fundamentally cognitive, theory of the relationship between some anxiety and depressive disorders (Alloy, Kelly, Mineka, & Clements, 1990).",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Insomnia was consistently predictive of depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and suicide, indicating insomnia is a risk factor for these difficulties. Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations. Despite these limitations, this review suggests that insomnia is a risk factor for poor mental and physical health.",

Syncope during exertion is more serious than syncope which occurs immediately after exertion. Whenever it is associated with exertion, it is most frequently neurocardiogenic, but other forms, such as cardiac, nervous/reflex or metabolic, are not excluded. There is still no specific test with which the type of syncope can be determined with certainty, hence it is necessary to obtain a precise history and carry out a clinical examination, laboratory investigations and electrocardiogram (ECG). If cardiac syncope is suspected, additional diagnostic tests such as echocardiogram and stress test are necessary. With the collected data, decisions are made on further management and a judgement is made as to whether the child can continue to be involved in sport.",

      "title": "Feeling the Blues",
      "abstract": "KUGATHASANDepression is a widespread illness that affects people regardless of age, nationality, race, and gender.Nearly everyone has feelings of blue moods at some point in their lives.It is when these feelings persist, recur, or become severe that one may be experiencing depression and should seek medical help.People with a depressive illness cannot merely \"pull themselves together\" and get better.Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years and it can be debilitating.Fortunately, today, there is a wide range of medications and therapies available to treat depression.A complex interplay of factors involving genetics, stress, and changes in body and brain function are thought to play a role in the development of depression (Kaufman, 2001).One of the reasons that depression is so common is because the illness may develop for a variety of reasons.A recent study suggests that abnormalities of the hippocampus may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression (Posener et al, 2003).The exact causes of depression are still in question, but scientists have identified certain risk factors that could increase the likelihood of one becoming depressed Family history of depression, stressful situations such as a death in the family or relationship troubles, dependence on alcohol or drugs, medical conditions such as diabetes or cancer, and other mental illnesses are all risk factors that could lead to depression.Depression can take many forms.What differentiates these forms are the severity and duration of the symptoms.However, there often is not a clear distinction between these different types of depression, since they frequently share many of the same characteristics.The different types of depression can be classified as minor depression or dysthymia, major depression, and manic depression (bipolar disorder), and within each of these main categories there are several subtypes.Major depression, sometimes called clinical depression, is the most common form of depression.It is characterized by a mood change that lasts more than two weeks and includes one or both primary signs of depression: overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief, and loss of interest or pleasure in usually enjoyable activities (Kaufman, 2001).People with major depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of worthlessness, impaired thinking or concentration, insomnia, feeling tired all the time, significant weight loss or gain.These symptoms may differ from person to person as well as from one depressive episode to the next.For example, some people may have insomnia and lose weight while depressed, whereas others may oversleep, overeat and gain weight (Madison Institute of Medicine).In addition, major depression can range from mild to severe, with varying intensity of symptoms.In extreme cases, people with severe depression may be unable to work or care for themselves.Although major depression is the most common form of depression, approximately 26 per cent of individuals with major depression also suffer from chronic minor depression or dsythymia (Harkness et al, 2002).Dysthymia is a long-lasting form of mild depression characterized by a persistently gloomy outlook.Dysthymia generally lasts for at least two years and sometimes more than five years (Mayclinic.com).It usually isn't as disabling as major depression and periods of dysthymia may alternate with intervals of feeling normal.Signs and symptoms of dysthymia are like those of major depression but not as intense (Rapaport et al, 2002).",

According to the World Health Organization, at least one episode of headache during a lifetime has occurred in almost every inhabitant of the Earth, and about half of them noted periodic headaches. In its etiology, cephalalgia can be primary, not associated with organic damage to tissues and organs, and secondary, which is based on pathological changes. In particular, cephalalgia in inflammatory lesions of the paranasal sinuses, brain tumors, encephalitis and meningitis, acute cerebrovascular accident, head trauma, arterial hypertension, aneurysm of the cerebral vessels, etc., should be attributed to the secondary headache. In 95–97 % of cases, the headache is not based on organic lesion, and in this case, the headache is primary. Primary cephalalgia can be based on both vegetative-vascular and metabolic-destructive changes. Primary headache can be noted with emotional or physical overstrain, exposure to a number of light, sound or olfactory stimuli, liquorodynamic or dysmetabolic disorders, when taking certain medications. Conventionally, primary headache can be divided into three groups — tension headache, migraine and cluster headache.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

Differentiating confusion, fear, or irritability following a seizure from a postictal psychosis requires careful history taking. Psychosis can also be the result of a comorbid illness; one should also consider potential causes such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The timing of symptoms is a key consideration when trying to determine if someone has a postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis is classically preceded by a lucid interval, followed by a prolonged period of psychosis lasting more than 24 hours. Treatment with antipsychotic medications is often required. For many patients, antipsychotic medications can be discontinued once symptoms resolve.",

      "abstract": "Pain is one of the most prevalent and costly national health problems in today's society (Bonica, 1985). In addition to economic loss, pain yields human suffering and personal loss in ways impossible to quantify meaningfully. Pain research has grown rapidly in recent years and has incorporated developments from such diverse disciplines as psychology, sociology, and anthropology, as well as the more obviously related fields of physiology and clinical medicine. While this expanded inquiry has greatly refined our understanding and treatment of pain, there nevertheless remain many unanswered questions about this complex human phenomenon. The use of music as one cognitive strategy technique to reduce pain perception has received some attention in the medical field; however, many of the accounts of the beneficial influences of music on the alleviation of pain are either anecdotal in nature or lack adequate controls in experimental or clinical studies to elicit much confidence in the results. This is problematic because it is not clear as to which dimensions of pain—psychological or physical—active listening to music may affect, nor does it provide clear evidence that such effects are consistent or reliable. Only through the controlled use of music in an experimental design can the validity of the effectiveness of music as a pain management technique be determined. This article aims to provide a broad spectrum of current knowledge of human pain and its control by music with the intent to suggest proper theoretical background and possible applications of music in pain therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

The poor response to psychological treatments is noteworthy and organic features, of a specific type, have been implicated. The most recent evidence strongly supports earlier findings of a genetic factor. Damage or malfunction of the left temporal lobe of the brain, or of the frontal area, are associated with violent psychopathic behaviour. Dysfunction in these same areas has also been found in schizophrenic patients and there is a genetic relationship between psychopathy and schizophrenia. It is concluded that organic factors probably underpin some psychopathic behaviour, a situation which may affect our attitudes.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "Emotional burnout in medical workers during the work in extreme conditions",
      "abstract": "Medical staff is exposed to a complex of adverse occupational factors of physical, chemical, and biological nature, high severity and intensity of the labor process. Unsatisfactory working conditions are associated with health risks for medical personnel and can lead to occupational and work-related diseases. The most often occupational diseases detected in medical staff are infectious ones. In the context of the spread of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), the probability of infection of the medical personnel themselves with possible damage to organs and body systems with a subsequent disability is high. The article pays considerable attention to the high level of neuro-emotional stress, the problem of burnout, accompanying the work of medical personnel, especially in extreme conditions, which include epidemics and pandemics, in particular the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of burnout syndrome (BS) among medical personnel in many countries has reached crisis proportions, exceeding the level of any other occupational group. Despite a significant number of studies related to the study of BS in medical personnel, there are still difficulties with its diagnosis, primarily associated with the subjectivity of the methods used; there is little scientific evidence about the clinical manifestations of BS, its symptoms. The study of the phenomenon of emotional burnout, its prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation is relevant in connection with the direct relationship of BS not only to maintaining the health, mental stability, and professional longevity of specialists involved in long-term interpersonal communication but also to the preservation of the patients’ health. It is necessary to discuss making additions to the list of occupational diseases and to the list of harmful and dangerous industrial factors and works in which preliminary and periodic medical examinations are carried out, concerning medical staff whose working conditions are associated with the high nervous and emotional stress, in particular during work in extreme conditions.",

Descriptive data on age, past history of associated psychosomatic disorders, mode of onset of pain, patterns of pain location and tenderness, the latter considered the hallmark of tension myositis, and certain neurological correlates, suggest that it is the major cause of back pain rather than structural aberrations of the spine. It is suggested that success or failure in the conventional treatment of back pain is evidence for a psychosomatic process, via the placebo mechanism.",

MSDs can arise from a sudden exertion such as lifting a heavy object, or can arise from making the same motions repeatedly or from repeated exposure to force, vibration, or awkward posture over a long period of time. The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge. MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

      "title": "A narrative review of risk factors and predictors for poor outcome and prolonged recovery after a mild traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are often caused by a blow to the head or a sudden jolt resulting in a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional temporary symptoms. Mild TBI diagnosis can be challenging and most commonly followed by post-concussion syndrome (PCS). When the symptoms are present for more than 3 months, prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) can be suspected. This review aims to identify and summarize the current status of the knowledge regarding the risk factors and predictors of the recovery from PCS and PPCS. A comprehensive search of the main scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed using keywords, such as: 'prolonged post-concussion syndrome', combined with 'risk factors', 'predictors', and 'outcomes'. Multiple studies reported more than one risk factor for PPCS development following mTBIs that were generally the results of sports-related concussions and car accidents. The most prevalent risk factor associated with PPCS was the female sex. Social factors/personality traits, anxiety, mental health disorders, or other health conditions from their past medical history, the occurrence of headache/migraines during TBI recovery, somatization, physical activity, and litigation were also reported to contribute to PPCS risk. An exhaustive approach is required to mitigate the risk of PPCS and to ensure optimal recovery after concussive events. However, larger prospective cohort studies evaluating patients that were examined and treated with standardized protocols could be needed to further validate these associations and mandate the highest risk factors for delayed recovery.",

An important element of the clinical picture is also neurocognitive impairment. The most common treatment methods for depression and anxiety are pharmacology, psychotherapy or a combination of both methods. The data from literature show that those treatment methods lead to an improvement of clinical symptoms, but they exert a possible impact on cognitive functions. However the study results referring both to the role of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy in this domain are still inconsistent. There is an increasing number of accessible data confirming the positive effects of those clinical interventions on cognitive functioning of anxiety and depressive patients, but the interpretation is complicated because of differences in methodology as well as examined sample size and their characteristics. More studies are then needed to describe this phenomenon.",

Major depressive disorder occurs in 50 to 65% of individuals with panic disorder and there is considerable cross-sectional and longitudinal comorbidity with recurrent brief depression and dysthymia. Phobic anxiety disorders, most notably social phobia and generalised anxiety disorder, commonly occur with panic disorder, especially in individuals with more severe agoraphobia. Approximately 35 to 50% of individuals with panic disorder in community settings also have agoraphobia. Panic disorder also shows significant comorbidity with physical illness. Compared with individuals without or with some other psychiatric diagnosis, patients with panic disorder have an increased risk of suffering from multiple medically unexplained symptoms and are associated with high use of medical services and increased mortality from both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.",

A burning mouth sensation can occur in several cutaneous or systemic diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome, since this term is used exclusively to refer to idiopathic forms and is included within the cutaneous sensory disorders. In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other.

Mental changes can manifest as mild difficulties, but also as serious psychiatric disorders that require treatment. Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

      "title": "The influence of chronic stress on health and coping mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Stress represents a negative life experience, closely followed by physiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that focus on changing the event or adapting to its effects. Any situation or occurrence that requires adaptation can be experienced as a stress, even positive situations and circumstances may be stressful, whether they come from the outside world, or the sources of stress is internal. While acute stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, if it lasts for a long time, or is frequently repeated, it becomes chronic, and can cause various serious disorders. During chronic stress, there is an exhaustion of the body's capacity for an adequate reaction, which can lead to long-lasting immunological dysfunction, which significantly impairs health and quality of life. According to the WHO (2017), stress is one of the causes of even 60% known diseases, and in a number of mental disorders a direct connection with stress has been reported: in acute stress reactions, \"posttraumatic stress disorder\", adjustment disorders and other reactions to severe stress. In addition, in all categories of mental disorders (ICD-10), the stressful situation or event plays a significant role in occurrence of the symptoms. A particular category of stress-related disorders are psychosomatic disorders. These are functional disorders in which there is no pathoanatomic substrate. In contrast to these, psychosomatic diseases are the type of illness in which there are structural changes of tissues and organs, the etiology of which is based on chronic stress, in addition to a number of other factors (Adamović, 1983) and which occur when there is a biological predisposition. The paper presents the mechanism of development of these diseases and some of the ways of coping with stress. According to the DSM-V, psychosomatic diseases are divided into skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, heart and blood vessel diseases, disorders of endocrine glands, rheumatoid diseases, gynecological diseases and others. In order to overcome stress and preserve health, psychological strategies for coping with stress play an important role. Multiple strategies are used, which include various stress control techniques: relaxation techniques, meditation methods, and assertive training, biofeedback and stress inoculation techniques. Successful mastering of coping stressful situations, constructive problem solving in life crisis, relaxation techniques and contributions to better adaptation to unexpected changes in life are of key importance for both mental and physical health.",

The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir.

Bu nedenle olgunun tanısı cenaze manisi olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Olası yas tepkileri arasında nadir de olsa mani dönemi belirtilerinin görülebileceği unutulmamalıdır.",

Annually, pain is estimated to burden the U.S. economy with $100 billion in direct costs and $61 billion in productivity losses. These losses, which amount to a mean of 4.6 hours weekly, are largely due to diminished performance at work.1 Perhaps more significant, but more difficult to quantify, is the emotional distress and diminished quality of life that pain inflicts on individuals and their loved ones.\n\nWhat Is Pain? \n\nPain, as defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”2 Thus, pain is an experience that comprises a physical sensory component and an affective cognitive component. The physical element involves a nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory stimulus that is transmitted via the spinal cord to the thalamus and then to areas of the cerebral cortex, where it is perceived. Acute pain serves a biological purpose as an alert to potential, immediate, or ongoing injury.\n\nChronic pain is pathologic, serves no biological purpose, and can result from peripheral sensitization, in which processes (such as changes in gene expression in the dorsal root ganglia) augment the synthesis of various peripheral nociceptors. In turn, inputs to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are amplified, leading to activation of N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and subsequent …",

      "title": "Feeling emotional: the amygdala links emotional perception and experience",
      "abstract": "The term ‘emotion’ most commonly denotes a specific phenomenal state, such as the solemn weightiness associated with sadness or the lightness of being associated with joy. Human affective neuroscience has begun to pin down the elusive neuroanatomy of these most experientially prominent of mental experiences. One of the brain structures consistently associated with emotional functioning is the amygdaloid complex (Phan et al., 2002). Numerous neuroimaging studies have shown the amygdala varies with emotional experience in both healthy and mood disordered populations, pointing to its central role in emotional phenomenology. One difficulty with this apparent association is that emotion like cognition is not a single entity but is a multi-component process. Emotions reflect a constellation of diverse but correlated central neurocognitive and peripheral physiologic events. For example, witnessing a gruesome automobile accident is highly negatively valent, may involve specific appraisals related to fear or sadness, results in central and peripheral autonomic arousal, is attention grabbing thereby demanding to be the central focus of awareness, and in the following months and years may be associated with vivid reminiscences. In the safer confines of the lab or the bore of an MRI scanner, the amygdala has been associated to some extent with all of these putative functions. As such, amygdala activity may represent the generation of emotional experience itself, and/or it may reflect sundry aspects of emotional information processing correlated with emotional experience. In this issue, Feldman Barrett et al. demonstrate amygdala responses represent a critical nexus between the propensity for emotional experience and emotional interactions with perceptual encoding. The amygdala's role in feeling emotions may be tied to enhanced sensitivity toward emotional perception.\r\n\r\nFeldman Barrett et al. examined amygdala activation and its relation to emotional experience through the use of experience sampling. For 1 month three times daily, participants were probed via handheld PDA to indicate their present emotional state. One year following, participants were presented with backwardly masked fearful facial expressions during fMRI to index sensitivity of perceptual encoding of emotional events. Individual differences in propensity for negative affect, as indexed by experience sampling, were correlated with magnitude of amygdala response to presented fear faces. Moreover, in participants reporting increased anxiety during scanning, amygdala responses were associated with enhanced perceptual encoding of faces as indicated by increased fusiform activity. These results suggest that the amygdala may contribute to emotional experience by setting the appropriate preconditions for its expression: enhancing attention and associated perceptual encoding of emotional events, and thereby increasing their subjective salience.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mounting neuroimaging evidence consistent with an important role of the amygdala in generating affective experience there is surprisingly little direct evidence of disordered emotional experience following amygdala damage (Anderson and Phelps 2000; Anderson and Phelps 2002; Tranel et al., 2006), compared with evidence of the amygdala's central role in the emotional enhancement of mnemonic (Cahill et al., 1995) and perceptual processes (Anderson and Phelps 2001; Vuilleumier et al., 2004; Adolphs et al., 2005). For instance, patients with amygdala lesions provide retrospective reports of affective states (daily reflections) and traits (yearly reflections) of similar magnitude, frequency and underlying covariance structure to healthy controls (Anderson and Phelps, 2002). When asked to relive emotions, examinations of facial efference reveal that patients with bilateral amygdala damage display remarkably intact emotional expressions, including fear, despite pronounced impairments in the perception of these same signals (Anderson and Phelps, 2000). The results of such lesion studies, however, regard introspective emotional experiences that are associated with complex abstract factors and not directly tied to momentary environmental events. Many emotional experiences involve ruminations upon the past or future, thereby involving representations of threats and rewards in the absence of in the moment environmental stimulation. Such forms of emotional replay and forecasting may depend upon evolutionary more recent prefrontal neocortical representations rather than the amygdala alone. By contrast, the results of Feldman-Barrett et al. suggest that the amygdala's role is more related to momentary experiential states and enhanced attention and sensitivity toward encoding events surrounding these states.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is neuroanatomically positioned to make a rapid and coarse appraisal of the state of the world, and via robust feedback projections, alter the perceptual process by enhancing the encoding of events of potential self importance. Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotionally arousing scenes vigorously engage early primary and secondary visual cortex (Bradley et al., 2003). Emotions thus bias attention to focus on events associated with subjective and physiologic arousal, shaping the ultimate contents of awareness (Anderson, 2005). Such arousal based modulatory effects depend on the integrity of the amygdala, with amygdala lesions eliminating the subjective biasing of perception toward the significant relative to the mundane, rendering the attentional landscape flat (Anderson and Phelps, 2001). Directly corroborating the results of Feldman-Barrett, enhanced extrastriate cortical responses to facial expressions of fear are correlated with magnitude of amygdala response (Morris et al., 1998), and these enhanced extrastriate responses are abolished following amygdala damage (Vuilleumier et al., 2004). The amygdala's role in evaluating the emotional value of fearful faces similarly depends on the ability to correctly attend to and encode their important features (Adolphs et al., 2005). If all the world's a stage, then the amygdala may be the emotional spotlight, shedding light on the most dramatic players of our life story.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala may thus represent embodied attention—the crucial link between central (mental) and peripheral (bodily) resources. Attention and awareness should be coupled with information of sufficient importance to result in autonomic activation and associated mobilization of peripheral metabolic resources, such as through altered respiration and heart rate. This redirecting of bodily physiologic resources may serve as the common primitive foundations of both attention and emotional experience. This common origin supports why emotional states are strongly correlated with how we think about and perceive the environment (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005; Rowe et al, 2007). More than a simple correlation, Feldman-Barrett et al.'s results suggest that emotional experience and individual differences therein may critically depend upon how we attend to the world (Barrett and Niedenthal, 2004; Anderson, 2005). Rather than being an ancillary consequence of, altered attention to emotional events may be part and parcel of emotional experience itself.",

      "title": "Neurally mediated syncope",
      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

Συνολικό ποσοστό συμμετοχής 87%.Ο ετήσιος επιπολασμός της οσφυαλγίας και της αυχεναλγίας ήταν ιδιαίτερα υψηλός,63% και 48% αντίστοιχα, και ακολουθούσαν ο πόνος σε καρπό/άκρο χέρι (38%), στονώμο (37%), στο γόνατο (26%) και στον αγκώνα (20%). Δύο τρίτα των συμμετεχόντων στημελέτη είχαν πόνο σε πάνω από δύο εντοπίσεις και 23% είχαν πόνο σε πάνω από τρειςεντοπίσεις μέσα στους προηγουμενους 12 μήνες. Ο πόνος πολλαπλής εντόπισης που είχεεπιπλέον χαρακτηριστικά όπως συχνή εμφάνιση (≥30 ημέρες συνολικά τους τελευταίους12 μήνες) ή/και συνοδό δυσκολία στην εκτέλεση καθημερινών δραστηριοτήτων (≥2)ήταν λιγότερο συχνός, και αφορούσε το 4-5% του δείγματος. Εξηντα-δύο τοις εκατό τωνσυμμετεχόντων με πόνο πολλαπλής εντόπισης στην πρώτη φάση ανέφεραν και πάλιπόνο πολλαπλής εντόπισης 12 μήνες μετά, ενώ η επίπτωση νεοεμφανιζόμενου πόνουπολλαπλής εντόπισης ήταν 16% για τους 12 μήνες του follow up.Η σωματική καταπόνηση κατά την εργασία παρουσίασε θετική συσχέτιση με τον αριθμότων εντοπίσεων του πόνου (ΙRR:8.4; 95%CI: 2.0-34.7 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων με συχνήεμφάνιση και ΙRR: 25.8; 95%CI:3.6-186.5 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων πόνου με συνοδόαναπηρία). Για την τάση σωματοποίησης οι αντίστοιχοι δείκτες είχαν ως εξής IRR: 4.8;95%CI: 3.6-6.4 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων με συχνή εμφάνιση και IRR: 5.5; 95%CI:4.2-7.2για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων πόνου με συνοδό αναπηρία. H αντίληψη ότι ο μυοσκελετικόςπόνος προκαλείται από την εργασία είχε επίσης θετική συσχέτιση με τον αριθμόεντοπίσεων του πόνου (IRR: 1.7; 95%CI: 1.3-2.2 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων με συχνήεμφάνιση, IRR: 1.5; 95%CI:1.2-2.0 για τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων πόνου με συνοδόαναπηρία. Η ικανοποίηση από την εργασία και η υποστήριξη των συναδέλφων ή/καιτου προϊσταμένου είχαν αρνητική συσχέτιση με τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων του πόνου (ΙRR:0.6; 95%CI:0.5-0.8 και IRR:0.7; 95%CI:0.5-0.8 αντίστοιχα). Η γκρίζα ζώνη τηςαλεξιθυμίας είχε αρνητική σχέση με τον αριθμό εντοπίσεων του πόνου (IRR:0.6;95%CI:0.4-0.9), δίνοντας στοιχεία υπέρ μιας σχέσης δόσης απόκρισης πουαντιπροσωπεύεται από μια καμπύλη σε σχήμα «U». H CART ανάλυση κατέδειξε τηντάση για σωματοποίηση ως τον πιο καθοριστικό παράγοντα, για την εμφάνιση σε έναάτομο πόνο με μεγάλο αριθμό εντοπίσεων.Η τάση για σωματοποίηση φάνηκε να έχει επίσης ρόλο συγχυτικού παράγοντα στησχέση μεταξύ α. σωματικής επιβάρυνσης και β. ψυχοκοινωνικών χαρακτηριστικών τηςεργασίας και σε δύο σκορ που περιγράφουν την επιβάρυνση του ατόμου από τηνοσφυαλγία.Οι περισσότερες από 40 ώρες την εβδομάδα εργασίας φάνηκε να είναι ένας παράγονταςπου σχετίζεται με το νεοεμφανιζόμενο πόνο πολλαπλής εντόπισης (OR: 5.0, 95%CI:1.1-24.0), ενώ η βαριά σωματική καταπόνηση κατά την εργασία (OR:5.1, 95%CI:2.1-12.2), ημεγάλη τάση σωματοποίησης (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.9-5.5) , η πεσμένη διάθεση (OR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.0-3.2), το σκορ για τη νευρωτική διάσταση της προσωπικότητας (Coeff: 1.05, pvalue:0.05) και η αντίληψη οτι ο πόνος οφείλεται στην εργασία (ΟR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8), εμφανίστηκαν ως επιβαρυντικοί παράγοντες για την εμφάνιση εμμένοντοςμυοσκελετικού πόνου πολλαπλής εντόπισης ένα χρόνο αργότερα.Συμπέρασμα Ο μυοσκελετικός πόνος με μονήρη εντόπιση ήταν συχνός στο δείγμαπου μελετήθηκε, ενώ ο πόνος πολλαπλής εντόπισης ήταν ακόμη συχνότερος. Ταδεδομένα της μελέτης στηρίζουν την υπόθεση ότι εργασιακοί καθώς και ψυχοκοινωνικοίπαράγοντες σχετίζονται με τον εμμένοντα πόνο πολλαπλής εντόπισης. Ιδιαίτερο ρόλοφάνηκε να κατέχει η τάση για σωματοποίηση. Θα πρέπει να διεξαχθούν περαιτέρωέρευνες για να διαπιστωθεί αν ο πόνος πολλαπλής εντόπισης επηρεάζεται απόδιαφορετικούς παράγοντες σε σχέση με τον πόνο μονήρους εντόπισης, κι ακόμη ανδιαφορετικοί παράγοντες προδιαθέτουν σε εμφάνιση 1ου επεισοδίου πόνου πολλαπλήςεντόπισης από εκείνους που σχετίζονται με την μετάπτωσή του σε χρονιότητα.",

      "title": "Is essential hypertension sometimes a psychosomatic disorder?",
      "abstract": "There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the idea that mental stress and psychological illness might cause cardiovascular disease. Although the question of whether chronic, ongoing stress leads to the development of coronary heart disease remains a debated issue, the evidence establishing depressive illness as a bona fide cardiac risk factor is so strong that some national health policy statements confidently assert the causal link to be undeniable [1]. Similarly, the importance of short-term mental stress as a trigger for the development of myocardial infarction and sudden death in patients with existing heart disease is no longer questioned [2]. This relationship between acute mental stress and the incidence of heart attack has been spectacularly illustrated during natural disasters, such as the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake [3]. Stress and blood pressure Although the notion that essential hypertension may arise through psychosomatic mechanisms is rather more contentious than the stress–heart disease link, the idea is an old one, originally attributed to Geisbock [4]. The lay public needs no convincing that psychological factors cause high blood pressure although, despite such ready acceptance, proof that essential hypertension can be psychosomatic remains elusive. However, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory research does provide increasingly strong support for the notion that behavioural and psychological factors may be important in pathogenesis. Although a typical hypertensive personality does not exist, as a characteristic behavioural pattern, hypertensive patients have been reported to commonly exhibit subnormal levels of assertiveness and suppression of hostile impulses [5,6]. More important, perhaps, are long-term follow-up studies of human populations. In their celebrated study, Timio et al. [7] conducted a longitudinal investigation of cloistered nuns living in a secluded and unchanging environment in Umbria in whom blood pressure did not demonstrate the expected rise with age. Also important are epidemiological-based observations made in human populations that demonstrate blood pressure elevation soon after migration [8]. In this issue of the journal, Steptoe and Willemsen [9] continue this tradition, showing a blood pressure-raising influence of low job control in the workplace, in concert with increased perceived stress. A possibly surprising finding in their study, which reports results from a Whitehall II Study epidemiological cohort, was the failure to replicate findings from previous investigations [10,11] showing that job strain, defined as the relationship between the demands of a job to the degree of freedom to conduct it as desired (job demands/job control), is directly related to blood pressure during the working day and evening. Blood pressure was specifically related to job control (lower control linked to higher pressure) and the perceived stress of the job. The level of demand in the job was unrelated to blood pressure level. Higher socio-economic status participants, and women, were more stressed by low job control compared to men and people of lower socioeconomic status. As the authors suggest, higher socioeconomic groups are accustomed to greater degrees of control over their life circumstances and may, perhaps, find a lack of control at work particularly aversive and stressful. An unsettled issue is whether the marginally higher pressure in the low job control group might materially increase cardiovascular risk, or escalate over time to a pressure level that met the criteria for a diagnosis of hypertension. Assessing the cardiovascular effects of stress in humans: methodological aspects Whether or not repeated exposure to environmental stress, particularly in the workplace, might lead to sustained hypertension has been an issue of debate for some years [12,13]. One reason for the discrepant views is the methodological difficulties encountered when trying to precisely assess, in a quantitative fashion, the effects of stress on cardiac and vascular targets in humans. The traditional approach to this quantification is based on use of laboratory stressors, which are believed to reproduce, in a controlled environment, the effects of either physical or psycho-emotional daily life challenges [13]. The tests most commonly employed include hand-grip exercise (isometric muscle exercise usually applied for 90 s at 30% of the previously checked subject's maximal strength), cold pressor test (hand immersion in ice water for 60 s), mental arithmetics (administering subtractions of numbers of increasing complexity under pressure of time), mirror drawing test (reproduction of a geometrical drawing by observing the pencil-carrying hand only as reflected by a mirror), the Stroop colour-word test (computer-based test requiring the subject under examination to select a coloured object while exposed to conflicting visual and auscultatory stimulation), and public speaking. The accuracy in evaluating the blood pressure response to these manoeuvres has been considerably improved by the availability of systems for continuous blood pressure monitoring, such as the Finapres, the Finometer (Finapres Medical Systems, Arnhem, The Netherlands) and the Task Force Monitor (CNSystem, Graz, Austria), which have offered the possibility to precisely assess, on a beat-by-beat basis and non-invasively, not only the peak changes in blood pressure and heart rate induced by administration of the above laboratory tests, but also the dynamic profile of haemodynamic variations both during test performance and in the recovery phase [14]. However, in spite of such remarkable progress in the technology of cardiovascular monitoring, the ability of laboratory stressors to faithfully reflect the actual blood pressure and heart rate responses to daily life stress in the home or working environment remains a controversial issue. Indeed, we were able to show that the evaluation of the cardiovascular responses to laboratory stressors is affected by a number of limitations [13,15]. First, the observed blood pressure and heart rate changes may be poorly reproducible, displaying coefficients of variation in the range of 15–33% [16]. Second, subjects identified as hyper- or hyporeactive to a given stressors, may be, respectively, hypo- or hyper-reactive to another test [17]. Finally, only a limited relationship could be observed either between the responses to different laboratory tests and between the blood pressure or heart rate changes elicited in the stress laboratory on the one hand and the blood pressure or heart rate response of real life stressful conditions on the other. This was the case when specific types of daily life stressful conditions were considered, as exemplified by the ‘white-coat effect’ induced by a physician's visit. It was also the case when considering the overall quantification of daytime blood pressure and heart rate variability, taken as a global measure of the reactivity to daily challenges and quantified by means of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring techniques [13,17]. Indeed, the increasing diffusion of systems for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in daily life represents another major step forward in this field because it has allowed the much easier assessment of blood pressure and heart rate changes induced by physical or emotional stress in the subject's usual environment, either at home or in the workplace [18]. Through this approach, direct information could be obtained in real time on the blood pressure effects of extremely stressful conditions, such as flying a jetfighter aeroplane, or being exposed to the effects of a seismic shock during an earthquake [19]. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has also allowed the quantification of blood pressure effects for more common daily challenges, such as public speaking, undergoing job or university interviews, playing cards or driving a car in city traffic. In particular, for the first time, this approach has allowed the direct quantification of blood pressure and heart rate changes induced by job stress in different working environments [20,21]. This was also the case in the study by Steptoe and Willemsen [9], where the measurement of blood pressure changes induced by job-related stress was coupled with other parameters, with the aim of providing a deeper insight into the mechanisms that lead to blood pressure elevation in the workplace. Mediating mechanisms of a stress–hypertension link? What might be the pathophysiological mechanisms by which life stresses within or outside the workplace could generate hypertension? Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, as a mediating mechanism, is seen as central to the stress–hypertension link. This view was formalized in a recent ruling by an Australian Government body, the Specialist Medical Review Council (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, 27 March 2002), which was charged with evaluating the causal contribution of stress to the development of essential hypertension. Despite the medicolegal implications, the ruling was made that occupational stress is one proven cause of hypertension. The judgement was reached after due consideration of the epidemiological evidence but, perhaps surprisingly, was based in particular on the described neural pathophysiology of essential hypertension: (i) persistent sympathetic nervous activation is commonly present [22,23]; (ii) suprabulbar projections of noradrenergic brainstem neurons are activated [24,25], as is also seen in experimental models of stress; and (iii) adrenaline is released as a cotransmitter in the sympathetic nerves of hypertensive patients [26,27], as it also is in patients with panic disorder [28], who provide a clinical model of ongoing, severe stress response. These were all considered to be presumptive biological markers of stress. Experimental studies in the spontaneously hypertensive rat suggest that, with chronic mental stress, it may be the long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous outflow to the kidneys that is of particular importance as a blood pressure-elevating mechanism [29]. The causal significance of sympathetic nerve adrenaline co-transmission per se remains uncertain. One theory of the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, the ‘adrenaline hypothesis’ [30], envisages that stress is a major factor in hypertension pathogenesis through stress-induced elevations in the plasma concentration of adrenaline enlarging the pool of adrenaline present in sympathetic nerves, leading to release of adrenaline as a co-transmitter, facilitation of noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves, resultant cardiovascular stimulation and development of arterial hypertension. In two independent studies, the release of adrenaline from sympathetic nerves was demonstrated in patients with essential hypertension, providing the most direct evidence available to date in support of the adrenaline hypothesis of hypertension pathogenesis [26,27]. Although sympathetic nerve adrenaline co-transmission in essential hypertension can be taken to be a marker of chronic stress, the phenomenon of adrenaline cotransmission does remain unproven as a primary causal mechanism in essential hypertension. This is well exemplified by findings obtained in patients with panic disorder who, commonly, despite having recurrent stress responses during panic attacks that are sufficient to load their cardiac sympathetic nerves with adrenaline, leading to adrenaline co-release, do not have persistently elevated blood pressure [28]. Societal dimensions of the stress–hypertension debate It has not been easy to integrate the recent evidence linking psychological illness and stress with cardiovascular disease into the clinical practice of medicine. This is partly because the evidence of such a link has been slow in materializing and, in some areas, still remains fragmentary. Perhaps, more importantly, the spectre of workplace litigation hangs over this field, clouding the arguments and polarizing medical opinion. The study by Steptoe and Willemsen [9] will further fuel the debate. It may be that in hypertension, as is the case with coronary heart disease where multiple risk factors interact synergistically to cause the disease, interaction of the hypertension ‘risk factors’ of obesity, high dietary sodium intake, sedentary lifestyle and genetic predisposition occurs, perhaps in concert with chronic mental stress. Should it ever be demonstrated beyond dispute that occupational stress is an important cause of hypertension, it is hoped that the primary outcome would be the implementation of measures to reduce stress in the workplace, such as worker empowerment to end the low job control scenario, rather than a rash of lawsuits.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

However, in the physical impairment related diseases, it is difficult for the disease to occur only by internal factors, and it can be said that internal factors and external factors are combined. Therefore, when the physical impairment is caused by disease, it is important to the apportionment analysis of injury to think about the cause of the physical impairment by considering both the external and internal factors. The most commonly used the apportionment guide is the “Rhim's trauma apportionment guideline” in impairment evaluation. But this guideline is often difficult to assess in certain diseases. Since the apportionment analysis of external factors can bring about a difference in degree according to the viewpoint of the assessor, the degree of the physical impairment may vary greatly depending on case by case. Especially, it is not reasonable to assess based on causal relation with common sense or emotional, and it is necessary to make rational assessment based on medical evidence and professional knowledge.",

From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "Experiencing mood swings after giving birth can last over a longer period of time. Those mood swings are largely the result of hormonal changes and the physical process of recovery after childbirth. The relationship between the mother and her family members, the doctor, and the nurses, as well as their experiences together, are of great importance during pregnancy, giving birth and afterwards. Except for those factors and other risks, which can cause postnatal psychological changes, there are other conditions for postnatal depression to emerge, such as the characteristics of the mothers in terms of dealing with stressful situations, as well as their history of mental illnesses. Psychological changes after giving birth, mood disorders, are manifested in several ways: from the usual mild reactions of sadness, which spontaneously disappear in a few days, to difficult and severe disorders, which require a specialist’s intervention and often the hospitalisation of the mother. In those grave cases, the distorted perception of their child and surroundings can result in the mother harming herself or her child.\r\n Preventing serious troubles, helping the mother after childbirth, as well as recognizing the symptoms and reducing the risks of postnatal distress are responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Trained through education and courses, house visits, clinical examinations before, during and after birth, those primary and secondary medical care professionals continuously participate in the postnatal care of women. It is not only important to insure the healthcare for the mother and child’s physical wellbeing, but also taking care of their emotional needs.\r\n This paper aims to analyse some of the risk factors and prevention of postnatal depression and psychosis, and their connection.\r\n The results of the study performed have shown partial uniformity with other studies. 37% of the women questioned have experienced postnatal sadness and 16% have experienced postnatal depression. However, it has been found that 3% of the female testimonies have shown a postnatal psychosis. Of all the symptoms, the women questioned have selected “feeling tired” and “lack of energy” to the greatest extent. The smallest number have selected recurring “suicidal thoughts” and “thoughts of death”. The results suggest the presence of light and temporary mood swings, but also show a small amount of severe problems, which can be identified as disorders.",

      "title": "Psychophysiologic Disorders in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Psychosomatic disorders in children and adolescents is a topic that covers a wide variety of illnesses and one which is difficult if not impossible to define accurately. In general, chronic emotional states, often nonspecific, serve as strong contributors to the development of a physical illness. The particular illness is often dictated by varying degrees of biological predisposition in one physiological system—i.e., such a predisposition in the respiratory system may lead to asthma or in the gastrointestinal system to ulcerative colitis. In some cases the biological factor is large and the emotional factor minimal, while in other cases the reverse is true. In the early days of research in psychosomatic disorders it was widely believed that each disorder was accompanied by certain specific emotional problems. Further study has shown this is not true. It was also felt that many, if not most of these disorders could be cured by psychotherapy, and this also has proven to be a fallacy. We have moved more and more to the team approach. Since both psyche and soma are involved, more than one specialist is usually required. In children and adolescents this may involve a child psychiatrist, a pediatrician, an allergist or gastroenterologist, a social worker and a psychologist. It requires time and patience to form an effective and smoothly functioning team in which all members respect one another's potential contribution. Some examples of team operation are presented and some of the problems outlined. In addition, there is attention given to the special problems of the adolescent and also the child with chronic nonspecific physical complaints as well as the child who requires hospitalization.",

Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

PTSD may also worsen the course and outcome of already existing medical illness. Extant research has not addressed the possibility that medical Illness may worsen the course or outcome of PTSD, but similar research has shown only limited effects of medical illness on depression and anxiety outcomes.

Finally, emotional stress, anger, or worry have a dominant influence on the severity, frequency, and treatment of angina. The natural history of angina is characterized by episodic variations in the frequency and severity of symptoms coincident with periods of emotional stress. When angina is associated with periods of emotional stress or anger, the angina is not usually a result of progressive coronary disease, but rather is due to an increase in oxygen demand. Appreciation of this concept will help to rule out \"true\" unstable angina due to progressive coronary disease from recurrent angina that results from an increase in oxygen demand related to emotional stress. The former requires aggressive medical or surgical therapy; the latter, a demand-induced angina, responds to beta-adrenergic blockade and a tranquilizer.",

These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

There is a strong bidirectional association between anxiety and related disorders and co-occurring general medical conditions. The co-occurrence of anxiety and related disorders and general medical conditions is associated with significant impairment, morbidity and economic costs. At the same time, recognition of anxiety and related disorders in people with medical illness may be challenging when comorbid with physical illness due in part to overlap in symptomatology. Furthermore, there is a relatively limited evidence base of randomized controlled trials in this population. Additional work is needed to improve screening for anxiety and related disorders in medical illness, to enhance diagnosis and assessment, and to optimize treatment.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating injury results in damage to the brain. It is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in young people with a higher prevalence in men. TBI is the leading cause of disability and mortality between the ages 1 and 45. TBI can be caused either by the direct result of trauma or due to a complication of the primary injury. The most common etiological factors for TBI are falls, road traffic accidents, violent physical assaults, and injuries associated with athletic activities. Following TBI, significant neurologic complications may occur which include seizures, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cranial nerve injuries. In addition, people may suffer from various psychiatric complications such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other cognitive and behavioral sequel that might significantly increase the comorbidity of the victims. Considering all of the above complications, TBI is one of the significant public health burdens. Literature has shown that only about 25% of people achieve long-term functional independence following TBI. In this paper, we focused not only on the epidemiology but also the etiology, complications following TBI and understanding their underlying pathogenesis. Further, we focused on analyzing the options to improve the treatment and rehabilitation following TBI in future.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen an extraordinary growth in awareness of traumatic stress, not only among health workers but also among the general public. This increased awareness might suggest that mental health professionals have only just discovered the fact that human beings experience a psychological reaction following exposure to trauma or, worse, that the disorder has just been “invented”. It is important, therefore, to understand the historical context of PTSD. The notion that an individual may experience psychological problems following a traumatic experience is not new, with references dating back nearly three thousand years to Homer's Iliad. Shakespeare provided several descriptions of traumatic stress reactions, as have other writers throughout history. It was not until early this century, however, that the condition became the focus of interest from a scientific perspective. Several leading figures in the burgeoning field of psychiatry at that time, such as Freud, Kraepelin, and Janet, commented on the existence and nature of traumatic stress reactions following accidents, fires, and other traumatic events. fiartime experiences, notably in the American Civil fiar and the First fiorld fiar, prompted physicians to speculate on the cause of posttrauma reactions. The condition was thought initially to be a result of organic damage to the brain caused by explosions on the battlefield and thus the term “shell shock” was coined during the First fiorld fiar. It was not until later that the psychological basis of the disorder was widely accepted and clinicians began to recognize that terms such as “shell shock”, “war neurosis”, and “combat fatigue” all referred to the same phenomenon. Gradually, it was acknowledged also that these disorders were essentially no different from traumatic stress reactions seen in civilians following nonmilitary traumas such as transport accidents, fires, natural disasters, and violent assault.",

The symptomatology of these various forms of injury is, of course, manifold, but the outstanding symptom and the one usually present and common to all is convulsions. As a matter of fact, however, the rarity with which definite pathologic lesions are proved to exist is in rather striking contrast to the frequency with which convulsions occur. Indeed, it would seem quite probable that the existence of convulsions in whooping cough has frequently been the principal basis on which a diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, encephalitis or other lesion, has been set up. It is the purpose of this paper to call attention to the fact that infantile tetany, and not anatomic injuries or an unknown toxin, is often the cause of the convulsions",

      "abstract": "Background: Chronic postoperative pain (CPP) is an important health problem. This is a narrative review of etiologies, mechanisms, risk factors, means of reducing the risk, and treatment of chronic postoperative pain. Methods: This is a topical review based on a focused literature review and personal clinical experience and research efforts on chronic pain after surgical interventions. Results: CPP is defined as new pain in the area of surgery that lasts more than 3-6 months after the operation, is clearly related to tissue and nerve injuries during the operation and cannot be explained by other etiologies. The overall prevalence is that 20-40% have some pain and discomfort for a few weeks, 10% have moderate pain that cannot be neglected for a few months, about 1% develop debilitating CPP. CPP is caused by nerve and tissue injury and abnormal reactions to such injury. Only those who have preand peri-operative risk factors determined in part by genetic makeup, reinforced by abnormal pain modulating mechanisms, having chronic pain in other part(s) of the body, having psychological stress factors and catastrophizing thoughts and anxiety, having severe acute pain during and immediately after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation after cancer surgery, and being younger rather than elderly. Risks of CPP can be estimated by a simple scoring system with approximate risk prediction determined by the number and degree of preoperative risk factors. A number of procedures and drugs can ameliorate these risk factors: Regional and local anesthetic techniques when appropriate, anti-hyperalgesic drugs with nitrous Introduction Long-lasting new pain after an operation is a common, sometimes a debilitating consequence of surgery. We know some factors that increase the risk of developing chronic postoperative pain (CPP). The patients’ GP, surgeon, and anesthesiologist must focus on these risks and prioritize efforts to reduce their effects on the postoperative course. As Rashiq and Dick pointed out recently (1), the earliest practitioners of anesthesia could only pray that their patients survived anesthesia. Later generations, when anesthesia developed into a very safe practice, focused on reducing immediate complications after anesthesia and surgery. They established effective prophylaxis and treatment of acute pain, nausea, vomiting, and venous thromboembolism (2)]. The present generations of anesthesiologists, in collaboration with surgeons, are taking on the challenge of reducing long-term (1) Professor em at University of Oslo, Norway and consultant at Department of Anesthesiology, Rishospitalet and Department of Pain Management and Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway oxide, glucocorticoids, gabapentinoids, pregabalin more than gabapentin, possibly tricyclic antidepressant, and infusions of lidocaine and ketamine. Important is that the surgeon uses nerve-sparing techniques and operates as “atraumatic” as possible. Fast-track and vigorous mobilization and rehabilitation of functions after surgery is made possible by expert analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic drugs. Mot important is to NOT do unnecessary operations such as cosmetic breast enlargement and meniscectomies for atraumatic knee-meniscus degeneration. Acute Pain Service, extended to an Acute Pain-Followup Service is mandatory to make postoperative pain management optimal and to follow up and treat adequately those unfortunate patients who do develop CCP. Conclusions and implications: CPP is a common complication to well indicated surgery of any type, sometimes developing into a debilitating pain condition. Therefore, evaluation of risk factors before surgery and optimal management during and after surgery is highly important for the patient’s GP, his/her surgeon and anesthesiologist. Multidisciplinary pain management clinics are necessary for those unfortunate 1% of all surgical patients who develop complex, chronic postoperative pain.",

Cross-sectional studies have not supported the existence of a dichotomy between schizophrenia and affective disorders.

Longitudinal studies indicate that some patients with schizophrenia and major affective disorders go through a ‘schizo-affective period’ on the way to developing the clinical picture of the other disorder, while still other patients have a continuity of syndrome type. These findings suggest the importance of considering disorder processes rather than just disease types. An interactive developmental model of disorder is one way of conceptualizing these processes.",

Disasters have effects on both individuals and society in different dimensions, including health, economic, social, and psychological, and can have serious negative consequences. The number of individuals affected by natural disasters is increasing every year. While it is clear that natural disasters threaten human life and bodily health, little attention has been paid to their effects on mental health. Natural disasters threaten our psychological well-being in many ways, cause both short-term and long-term psychological distress and create a significant psychological burden. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome that occurs as a result of a serious threat or physical injury, a near-death experience, war-related trauma, sexual assault, interpersonal conflicts, child abuse, or a medical illness. When the literature is examined comprehensively, it has been determined that the incidence of PTSD after natural disasters is quite high. Causes of post-disaster PTSD include the nature of the trauma, its severity, loss of relatives and/or property, poor coping skills, displacement, and direct exposure to disaster. Studies have shown that both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments are effective on PTSD.",

Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

The physician who wishes to have a proper know ledge of insanity from a medical point of view must study the pathological conditions of which it is the symptom or the result, and when he has done so it is impossible for him to disconnect one series of observations from the other-the mental aberration from the accompanying disaese of tissue or pathological symptoms.",

Examples are the abnormal grief reactions following severe loss, and also reactions to experiences which appear outwardly trivial, but which nevertheless are damaging to self-esteem. Inability to show dissatisfaction and inhibition of one's own aggressive tendencies are characteristic of depressive neurosis. The analysis of the relevant factors, which is important for differential diagnosis, and above all in treatment, should take into account the current personal and social situation of the individual, his earlier psychological development, his constitution, any supervening physical disorder, and the influence of environmental and cultural forces.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found to exceed prevalence rates in the geriatric population. Anxiety occurs more frequently in PD than in most other medical illnesses of comparable disability. Thus, anxiety may be etiologically related to the neurobiological changes that accompany PD and not simply a behavioral reaction to chronic disability. The anxiety disorder in PD tends to be panic, phobic, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can be a manifestation of an \"off\" state, can be worsened by motor fluctuations, or can occur independently from—and even precede—motor manifestations. Anxiety in PD may be directly related to dopaminergic deficit or may be the result of imbalance in other neurochemical pathways. The neurotransmitters primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety are norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as some neuropeptides. The key to successful management of anxiety in PD is its early recognition. A \"team approach\" to treatment that includes pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures, such as education, counseling, and stress-reduction strategies, is most beneficial, particularly in a complex illness where motor and behavioral dysfunction are often intertwined and tend to affect each other. Well-designed studies that address the pharmacological management of anxiety in PD are needed. Nonetheless, based on clinical experience, the effective agents for primary anxiety disorders seem comparably efficacious in PD-related anxiety.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury, is common, and occurs both in sport and as a result of falls or accidents. Concussion has become an increasingly recognized public health concern, largely driven by prominent media coverage of athletes who have sustained concussion. Although much has been written about this condition, its natural history is still not well understood, and practitioners are only now beginning to recognize that concussion often manifests in different clinical domains. These may require targeted treatment in and of themselves; otherwise, persistent post-concussive symptoms may develop. Although most individuals who sustain a concussion recover, and although concussion is a treatable condition, it is important that concussion be managed early and comprehensively to avoid a more prolonged clinical trajectory. A relatively recent term often used in the setting of concussion is repetitive head impact exposure—a biomechanical force applied to the head that does not generate a clinical manifestation of concussion, but may result in structural brain changes. Although it is often assumed that repetitive head impact exposure leads to long-term neurological sequelae, the science to document this assumption is in its infancy. Repeated concussions may lead to depression or cognitive impairment later in life, and there is an emerging literature that repeated concussion and repetitive head impact exposure are associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or other neurodegenerative diseases. Currently there is no known causal connection between concussion, repetitive head impact exposure, and neurodegeneration, although this research is also still in its infancy.",

Athletes experiencing concussion often voice uncertainty regarding their health and their career. The very nature of concussion symptoms can be quite alarming and raise anxiety about threats to life or, at least, the quality of life.

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

This paper suggests how clinicians might simplify the diagnosis of orofacial pain. First, the pain is classified into one of the three basic pain categories: somatic, neuropathic, or psychogenic pain. Somatic pain results from noxious stimulation of normal neural structures. Neuropathic pain is caused by a structural abnormality in the nervous system. Psychogenic pain arises from psychic causes; there is no apparent physiologic or organic basis for the pain. The next step is to determine the tissue system from which the pain arises: intracranial, extracranial, musculoskeletal, neurovascular, neurogenous, or psychological. Finally, some of the more common orofacial pain syndromes within each category are discussed.",

Any part of the body can be involved, especially when fibromyalgia is induced or aggravated by multiple factors. Complaints can be subjective and hard to verify or quantify. They consist of symptoms, or expressions of what is bothersome, and signs. Physical signs are observed during a physical examination, such as a rash or an irregular heartbeat, and are easier to validate. Constitutional symptoms or signs are generalized and do not belong to any specific organ system or region of the body. Generalized fatigue is a prominent feature of fibromyalgia. Between 60 and 80 percent of fibromyalgia patients complain of fatigue, which is defined as physical or mental exhaustion or weariness. However, there are many reasons for fatigue. In a recent survey, 20 percent of the women in the United States and 14 percent of the men rated themselves as being significantly fatigued. This feeling can come on like a wave or be continuous.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

ABSTRACT: Anxiety is a state of intense restlessness and anxiety that occurs subconsciously against an unknown danger. The person who experiences anxiety will have something bad at any time and they will feel hurt and experience fear without reason.Its formation dates back to childhood and can continue in adulthood. Dental anxiety, on the other hand, is defined as the intense concern of the patient for all kinds of dental procedures.Dental anxiety against dentists and dental treatments is one of the problems affecting dental treatment. Children with high anxiety levels and uncontrollable increase in oral-dental health problems.In preventing this increase, the reasons causing dental anxiety should be determined.Dental anxiety can occur for individual or environmental reasons. While the child's own psychology is influenced by individual reasons, poor dental procedures in the dental of environmental origin or the experiences gained play an important role.The most important factors are the negative approach of the family to dental treatment, the preparation process for home treatment, low socioeconomic level, the child's age and the dental stories of the child's friends.The methods used in determining dental anxiety in children are psychometric, physiological, projective tests and scoring behaviors.In determining these methods, it is selected according to the child's age and level of development.In the success of dental treatment in children, determining the level of dental anxiety of the child is important in the application of appropriate behavior guidance technique.",

The concept of anxiety refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness as a personality trait. Anxiety states can be distinguished from other unpleasant emotions such as anger, sorrow or grief, by their unique combination of experiential, physiological and behavioural manifestations. An anxiety state is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness and worry, and by activation (arousal) and discharge of the autonomic nervous system. Calmness and serenity indicate the absence of anxiety; tension, apprehension and nervousness accompany moderate levels of anxiety; intense feelings of fear, fright and panic are indicative of very high levels of anxiety. But even individuals have coping skills and defences against anxiety that occasionally leave them relatively free of it.",

      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

      "title": "Measurement in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The science of the measurement of mental phenomena (psychometrics) is central to quantitative research in psychiatry. Without appropriate, accurate, stable, and unbiased measures, our research is doomed from the outset. Much effort has been expended over the last 40 years in the development of a bewildering array of assessments. Most of our measurement strategies are based on eliciting symptoms, either by asking the participant to complete a self-report questionnaire, or by using an interviewer to question the participant. Some are long, detailed, and comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessments. Others are much briefer, designed either to screen for probable cases, or as scalable measures in their own right, of a trait or dimension such as depression, neuroticism or cognitive function or as measures of an exposure to a possible risk factor for a disease. Researchers in other medical disciplines sometimes criticise psychiatric measures for being vague or woolly, because they are not based on biological markers of pathology. For this very reason, psychiatry was among the first medical disciplines to develop internationally recognized operationalized diagnostic criteria. At the same time the research interview has become progressively refined, such that the processes of eliciting, recording, and distilling symptoms into diagnoses or scalable traits are now also highly standardized. These criticisms are therefore largely misplaced. Thanks to the careful construction and extensive validation of the better established measures in psychiatric research we can now afford to be slightly more confident of their appropriateness, accuracy, and stability than would be the case even for some biological measurements. This confidence is based on our understanding of the <italic>validity</italic> and <italic>reliability</italic> of our measures.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Panic disorder is defined in DSM-IV1 as \"The presence of recurrent panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having another panic attack, worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attack, or a significant behavioral change related to the attacks.\" A panic attack is defined as \"a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes.\" 1) Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint; 9) derealization or depersonalization; 10) fear of losing control or going crazy; 11) fear of dying; 12) paresthesias; 13) chills or hot flashes. The following hypotheses have been used to conceptualize panic disorder from a psychiatrist's perspective.",

El propósito de este estudio fue conocer la presencia, severidad y frecuencia de síntomas en una muestra de 257 mujeres en climaterio, pacientes del Instituto Nacional de Perinatología de la Ciudad de México. Los resultados revelan que de los doce síntomas más frecuentes, cinco corresponden al factor emocional: tristeza, depresión, apatía, irritabilidad y cansancio; seis al factor de síntomas asociados a la vejez: dolor de huesos, dolor de espalda, dolor muscular, dolor articular, piel seca y problemas gastrointestinales, y solamente uno al factor de declive hormonal: el insomnio. Se concluye que los síntomas en el climaterio deben explicarse en términos más allá del mero declive hormonal.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

Anxiety disorders themselves cause profound individual distress, suffering and reduced work and social achievement. There is also a major risk factor for other types of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and alcohol/drug abuse. For these reasons, understanding the neural bases of anxiety, particularly the role of neuro-transmitters in the generation and treatment of anxiety is a key aspect of biological psychiatry. We now have a great deal of pharmacological evidence that anxiety can be increased as well as reduced by drugs. These studies have shown that there must be a number of different transmitters and possibly brain circuits involved in anxiety.",

      "title": "ADVANCES IN COMPREHENSIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.”106 Pain is the most common reason a patient presents to a physician for evaluation.80, 81 As expected, this physician is rarely a psychiatrist. If the patient suffers from chronic pain, defined by Bonica12 as pain persisting on a daily basis for a month beyond what would be considered the usual time for healing of underlying pathology, then many specialists are commonly involved in the care of the patient. The psychiatrist offers special skills in the care of patients with chronic pain. First, the psychiatrist is the examiner of mental life composed of thoughts, feelings, and actions. Patients with chronic pain suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions often not recognized or, when recognized, undertreated. The psychiatrist possesses the expertise in making these diagnoses and providing treatment for them. When a complete evaluation of the individual patient is not performed, the opportunity for making a diagnosis is lost, and the patient's suffering cannot be optimally treated. Second, as a result of caring for patients with mental disorders, the psychiatrist is the keeper of a specialized fund of knowledge. It is this specialized fund of knowledge about the conditions psychiatrists treat and not the fundamental methods they use in clinical practice that distinguishes psychiatrists from other medical specialists. Psychiatrists follow the same process of evaluating a patient as other physicians. Psychiatrists then offer the opportunity of innovative applications of their psychiatric knowledge, especially to the treatment-resistant chronic pain syndromes. This application helps to reintegrate psychiatry with the other specialties of medicine. These two skills define the role of psychiatrists in the treatment of patients, and subsequently how they can make a substantial contribution to the management of chronic pain. Chronic pain as a field of study has grown considerably. Many individuals now are attempting to define pain management as a separate medical specialty. Although it is impossible to review this entire literature, several advances are especially relevant to psychiatry. Psychiatrists need to understand that in addition to providing treatment for the psychiatric disorders accompanying chronic pain, they can apply psychological and pharmacologic methods to the primary treatment of chronic pain. The multidisciplinary, integrated treatment model of chronic pain is particularly suited to use by the psychiatrist who examines the entire person and not just a particular organ system. As a result, psychiatrists offer the opportunity to provide assistance to other health care providers who are managing patients with this difficult problem.",

Medical field exhibit many type of data and thus it provide large statically and dynamic data, its relevant Meta data which contains a detail information about the observation made in different scenario. Medical data such as EEG, ECG reports, MRI reports, different lab test reports and other observation which are either in text format or graphical image format derived. These are different sample format describe various symptoms and prevention associate with those symptoms. Genetic activity, genes presence and repetition also gives user activity detail and problems in human body. Mental illness is a type of disease which relate with the mental disorder. It deals in human interaction, its behavior, and its regular and irregular activity. In this stage human sudden start misbehave or extra activities during the particular phase and hence an un-predictable incident may occur. Psychometric disease cases are increasing day by day with different symptoms in human being. These are diseases which occur due to over work pressure, mental activity, some past human life incident or may be the victim of some good or bad incident. It leads to several problems in society, as per well issue with the person who is suffering with the particular disorder. An human interaction and understanding capacity is different than a normal person which keep person separate from the normal society and social life. These disorders also occur sometime very violent and make it very tedious to recover. Psychiatric relate to brain disorder, Mental disorder, irregular work performing in public etc. Diagnosis over the disease is complex and not fixed. In the previous research on the same concern shows that the past data can be analyzed properly and it can further be useful for the precautions. Mental disorder records may leads to several Meta data, report activities observed by hospital or supervision person. A classification over the given symptoms, its action and medical treatment help in diagnosis. Past studies always parts in important role using which further decision can be taken. Mental disorder, mental health, further possibilities can be observed and driven remedy can be discussed. Data classification algorithm makes it possible to classify the normal and abnormal data cases. Hospital release dataset give the information which tends to changes, mental health of previous patients and their best precautions taken to cure them. Different algorithm model is used which help in mining the previous algorithm data rule over the past cases. It enable user to understand past cases, their symptoms, disease occurred and its diagnosis steps taken. Various algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Naïve bayes, Ant colony optimization, Rule based reasoning (RBR), Case based reasoning (CBR) and Artificial neural network (ANN) is used for psychometric disease finding from the large dataset. In this paper survey of past techniques is performed. This paper also illustrates the work finding and limitation of previous research. An analysis using the real time dataset over the proposed algorithm is left for further work..",

      "abstract": "Delusional misidentification syndromes constitute a number of disorders that involve a myriad of delusions related to the identity of self or other.The forms of delusion range from misattribution of identity related to self, other, as well as parts of the body.Although rare, these syndromes are encountered in a number of different forms by medical and psychiatric personnel, as well as other types of mental health workers.This is especially true since many of the syndromes have organic etiology and are treated via medical rather than psychological intervention.Nevertheless, delusional misidentification syndromes often co-exist with psychiatric issues which can be helped by concurrent psychological treatment.Given that identity is central to human beings and their cultures, it is not surprising that delusional misidentification is represented in a number of cultural beliefs.Some cultural expressions of delusional misidentification may function as coping mechanisms for anxiety over loss of identity or the trauma of infant mortality.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are both common and consequential, but too often remain undiagnosed. The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

      "abstract": "El estres se manifiesta cuando un organismo esta bajo un estado de presion por fuerzas externas y este mismo trata de retomar su estado original. Esta afeccion se presenta frecuentemente en todas las personas del mundo y mas, si estos se encuentran laborando y/o estudiando, si el estres se presenta en exceso o no se puede revertir, se pueden generar distintas enfermedades como: hipertension y diabetes, las cuales presentan sintomatologias como: aumento de la presion sanguinea, gastritis, problemas del sueno, agotamiento, alteraciones de apetito, tension y dolor muscular, dolores de cabeza, alta temperatura corporal, pesadillas, ansiedad, fobias e irritabilidad, ademas, no solo se generan alteraciones a la salud, sino tambien en el rendimiento academico y laboral causando ausencia e incapacidad para cumplir con sus deberes, hasta incluso se pudiese llegar a la muerte. En la presente investigacion se determinaron las diferentes variantes que pueden llegar a ser alteradas por el estres academico y laboral. Los datos se obtuvieron midiendo los parametros fisiologicos de frecuencia cardiaca, presion arterial y glucosa serica utilizando los equipos necesarios para ello, ademas, se aplicaron diferentes encuestas como el PSS-14 e Inventario SISCO, los resultados recabados se verificaron estadisticamente con las pruebas de Ryan-Joiner y Kruskal-Wallis aplicando un nivel de confianza del 95%, concluyendo estadisticamente que el estres fisiologico no puede ser danino o mortal cuando se liga directamente con el estres academico y laboral.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

The interpretation of abdominal pain is a perennially interesting subject. The topic never grows old; nor can it be said that the subject has ever been fully analyzed and filed away in medical archives. Every new or improved diagnostic agent that is developed renders finer methods available for the interpretation of abdominal pain. Thus the electrocardiograph has helped to establish the fact that certain types of so-called acute indigestion, both fatal and otherwise, are actually coronary disease with referred abdominal pain. In a recent paper I<sup>1</sup>discussed the mechanism by which coronary disease causes acute abdominal pain. The abdomen has been properly called the barometer or spokesman of the body. The abdomen calls attention to trouble but it does not locate it. The task remains for the physician, who must bear",

Освен това депресията често идва със симптоми на безпокойство. Тя може да доведе до различни емоционални и физически проблеми и да намали способността на човек да функционира на работното място и у дома. Депресията е различна от колебанията в настроението, които хората изпитват като част от нормалния живот. Временните емоционални отговори на предизвикателствата на ежедневието не представляват депресия. Депресията и тревожните разстройства са различни, но хората с депресия често изпитват симптоми, подобни на тези на тревожно разстройство, като нервност, раздразнителност и проблеми със съня и концентрацията. Но всяко разстройство има свои собствени причини и собствени емоционални и поведенчески симптоми. Много хора, които развиват депресия, имат история на тревожно разстройство по-рано в живота си. Няма данни, че едно разстройство причинява другото, но има ясни доказателства, че много хора страдат от двете заболявания. Депресивните разстройства включват две основни подкатегории: тежко депресивно разстройство / депресивен епизод, което включва симптоми като депресивно настроение, загуба на интерес и намалена енергия. В зависимост от броя и тежестта на симптомите депресивният епизод може да бъде категоризиран като лек, умерен или тежък. Дистимия, персистираща или хро нична форма на лека депресия. Симптомите на дистимия са подобни на депресивен период, но са склонни да бъдат по-малко интензивни и да продължават по-дълго. Депресията е рисков фактор за суицидни мисли (има много повече опити за самоубийство, отколкото завършени действия). Депресията засяга 350 милиона души. Търсенето на ограничаване на депресията и други състояния на психичното здраве се увеличават в световен мащаб.",

Stress is a combination of physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioural and emotional responses to new or threatening stimuli and serves as a protective adaptation of the body under physiological conditions. In accordance with the effect on the body, beneficial and negative stress is distinguished. Stress can be divided into “chronic” and “acute”. The intensity of the physiological response to a stressor is highly individual and situationally dependent. Many variables, including personal attributes, coping strategies, social support, and past experiences may modify the physiological stress response in any given situation and can account for the different response of people exposed to the same stressor. Intense and persistent stress can lead to psychological and pathological body injury. Stress has a significant impact on different brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala etc. Depression, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and even stress-induced mental diseases are closely related to functional and structural damage of the related brain regions. Repetitive daily acute stress can be associated with different diseases, first of all cardiovascular diseases, which affect quality of life and can cut short life expectancy. Timely treatment is required to prevent progression of early stress reactions to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in individuals at high risk. Advanced stress and anxiety management interventions include non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.",

      "title": "The significance of panic in general medicine",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder, as a useful diagnostic concept, has progressed well beyond the practice of psychiatry into the realm of general medicine. This worthwhile development boasts practical and heuristic implications. As a practical matter, it means that previously misunderstood patients, who often were dismissed as simply overly emotional, may now find specific useful treatment. The challenge to the clinician/scientist is to be able to evaluate several major possibilities; panic disorder may cause, exacerbate, initiate, and perhaps even prevent general medical illness. On the other hand, some general medical illnesses may cause, exacerbate, initiate, and perhaps even prevent panic disorder. Also, comorbid panic disorder and a general medical illness may be a manifestation of a deeper underlying causal process of which they are superficial manifestations. It is also possible that, by studying patterns of comorbidity, we may find what seems almost certain to be true, that panic disorder is causally heterogeneous. Of particular interest would be investigating whether patterns of disease provocation of panic disorder can help us understand panic pathophysiology. Just what physiological dysfunctions make the panic more probable? Our initial interest in panic disorder came with the observation that imipramine blocked spontaneous panic in patients in whom long-term intensive psychotherapy had failed and in whom chlorpromazine had actually exacerbated the symptoms. When it was discovered that lactate infusions would actually precipitate panic in patients prone to panic, but not normals or patients with other anxiety disorders, under controlled double-blind circumstances, an instant argument was started. Was the lactate doing anything biochemically or physiologically specific, or was it simply a stress that reminded the patient of past panics and therefore throwing them into a panic? This contention was investigated by Ferris Pitts who demonstrated that the infusion of EDTA, a powerful calcium-chelating substance, which actually threw the patients into tetany, nonetheless did not produce a panic attack. This specificity",

Independent depression syndrome describes a patient who meets criteria for major depression or dysthymia, and it is clear in the history that the depression is independent of effects of substances. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) introduced substance-induced depression to recognize the existence of syndromes of depression that cannot be established to be independent, but that nonetheless appear to exceed the usual effects of substance intoxication or withdrawal and require clinical attention. A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse. Chronic medical disorders, especially those producing chronic pain, also need to be considered.",

What can the physician say to help—particularly if it's someone in good health who is reasonably affluent and in apparently beneficent circumstances? This sort of patient may have a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or phobia. Or his diagnosis may be something else, because anxiety has so many manifestations and because it is found in most mental disorders. Further, anxiety may in large part be a reaction to stress, sometimes to stress not recognized as such. It is hard to find the cause of anxiety. Even with prolonged, expert help, many patients do not achieve functional insight, and of those who do, not every one gets relief. The anxious patient is not a clear entity suitable for research.

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differs from other anxiety disorders in that experience of a traumatic event is necessary for the onset of the disorder. The condition runs a longitudinal course, involving a series of transitional states, with progressive modification occurring with time. Notably, only a small percentage of people that experience trauma will develop PTSD. Risk factors, such as prior trauma, prior psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, peritraumatic dissociation, acute stress symptoms, the nature of the biological response, and autonomic hyperarousal, need to be considered when setting up models to predict the course of the condition. These risk factors influence vulnerability to the onset of PTSD and its spontaneous remission. In the majority of cases, PTSD is accompanied by another condition, such as major depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. This comorbidity can also complicate the course of the disorder and raises questions about the role of PTSD in other psychiatric conditions. This article reviews what is known about the emergence of PTSD following exposure to a traumatic event using data from clinical studies.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

The dichotomy between mechanical and inflammatory derivation is blurred and the possibility of referred pain is always present. Solutions are facilitated with careful localization and identification of exacerbating and ameliorating factors. Fibromyalgia, pain reproducible by pressure on specific points, must be distinguished from general body pain. It is the clinical evaluation that allows distinguishing among the most common causes of back pain and assures minimal chance of overlooking non-musculoskeletal explanations. Removal of narcotics from the therapeutic armamentarium is a good start. Pain is often accompanied by depression, although common measures of depression are not specific, being a component of the pain itself. Mechanical solutions to back pain, whether perceived as mechanical or inflammatory in derivation, are reasonable initial approaches. Finally, the importance of sleep hygiene cannot be overemphasized, as disturbed sleep aggravates pain, even if it is not the initiating factor.

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "abstract": "The sense of personal identity is an element of the Jasperian definition of self-conscience. Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

The process of learning about pain starts at birth. The newborn child reacts to painful stimuli, as shown by the response to injections of drugs given under the skin shortly after birth. Newborn babies may, in fact, experience pain during birth when forceps are used, or a bone is damaged. The reaction to pain usually takes place after an interval of about half a second, and the appreciation of pain is slightly longer delayed. Pains caused by stressful situations in children are nearly always located in the abdomen, whereas pains in the joints, or the head, usually have a physical basis. The response to painful stimuli is greatly influenced by upbringing, and the environment, and in some societies the fortitude with which pain is borne is a measure of manhood.",

Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly.

      "abstract": "Introduccion: el dolor cronico musculoesqueletico afecta a mas de una quinta parte de la poblacion y su prevalencia esta aumentando. El dolor cronico genera sufrimiento a las personas que lo sufren y en quienes les rodean, generando una pobre calidad de vida tanto a nivel fisico como emocional. Se ha convertido en la primera causa de discapacidad siendo el raquis la localizacion mas frecuente del dolor persistente, aunque es habitual que los pacientes con dolor cronico de espalda presenten dolor en otras regiones corporales, ya que independientemente de la localizacion, los mecanismos neurofisiologicos implicados en la perpetuacion del dolor son los mismos. La alta prevalencia del dolor cronico musculoesqueletico genera un enorme gasto sanitario y tiene un gran impacto economico por los costes indirectos derivados de la discapacidad y el dolor. Los avances en neurofisiologia y neurociencia nos han permitido comprender que la perpetuacion del dolor se debe a alteraciones en los mecanismos centrales de procesamiento y evaluacion de estimulos nociceptivos, y a una inactivacion de los mecanismos de analgesia endogena (Sensibilizacion Central y dolor nociplastico). Los tratamientos habitualmente utilizados para el dolor cronico musculoesqueletico son fundamentalmente pasivos (farmacologicos e invasivos), y obtienen pobres resultados. Estos tratamientos que se aplican desde el sistema publico de salud, no se ajustan a las recomendaciones de las principales guias de practica clinica, que recomiendan educacion y ejercicio como primera linea de tratamiento. Hasta la fecha no se han adaptado estas recomendaciones a nuestro sistema sanitario, ni se ha comprobado la eficacia de un abordaje terapeutico basado en estas recomendaciones de primera linea y realizado desde Atencion Primaria. \nObjetivo: Valorar los efectos de un programa de educacion en neurociencia del dolor y ejercicio fisico con componentes ludicos, retos y dobles tareas, sobre la calidad de vida, el catastrofismo, la kinesiofobia, la sensibilizacion central, la intensidad del dolor, la discapacidad y el consumo de analgesicos en pacientes con DCE\nMetodologia: Se realizo un ensayo clinico multicentrico pragmatico en 12 Centros de Salud. Se reclutaron pacientes con dolor cronico de espalda (n=170), y se realizo una asignacion aleatoria al grupo experimental (n=89) y al grupo control (n=81). El grupo experimental recibio un educacion en neurociencia del dolor (10 horas) y 18 sesiones de ejercicio fisico terapeutico (3 sesiones/semana). El grupo control recibio el tratamiento fisioterapico habitual que se realiza en las unidades de fisioterapia de AP, sustentado por los protocolos vigentes y consistente en 15 sesiones de termoterapia y electroterapia analgesica y un aprendizaje de ejercicios supervisados por un fisioterapeuta. Se realizo una valoracion inicial, post-intervencion (semana 11) y a los seis meses (semana 26). Las variables del estudio fueron calidad de vida (SF-36), catastrofismo, kinesiofobia, discapacidad, sensibilizacion central, intensidad de dolor, umbrales de dolor a la presion, consumo de farmacos y satisfaccion.\nResultados: El grupo experimental obtuvo mejores resultados en todas las variables respuesta con diferencias clinicamente relevantes y estadisticamente significativas (p <.001). El grupo experimental mejoro la calidad de vida (d=1,8) en componente sumario fisico, catastrofismo (d=1,7), kinesiofobia (d=1,8), la sensibilizacion central (d=1,4), discapacidad (d=1,4), la intensidad del dolor (d= 3,3), umbrales de dolor a la presion (d=2) y redujo el porcentaje de consumidores de analgesicos a la mitad, y los que continuaron con medicacion analgesica redujeron el consumo (d=0,97). Las mejoras posteriores a la intervencion (semana 11) se mantuvieron a los seis meses. El tratamiento experimental genera altos niveles de satisfaccion. El analisis de los datos permite elaborar reglas de prediccion clinica que han de ser validadas con una muestra mayor de pacientes.\nConclusion: Un programa de educacion en neurociencia del dolor y ejercicio fisico realizado desde Atencion Primaria es superior al tratamiento habitual en cuanto a mejora de calidad de vida, disminucion del catastrofismo, kinesiofobia, sensibilizacion central, discapacidad, intensidad del dolor y consumo de analgesicos.",

      "title": "Trastorno por estrés postraumático en pacientes con lesiones no intencionales producidas en accidentes de tránsito",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY We have carried out this research because accidents are a serious public health problem in Mexico. They are the third overall mortality cause and the first among young adults. In addition, in our country, the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been focused sufficiently on accidents, not to speak of motor vehicles accidents. Among the different types of accidents, traffic accidents are placed at the top of the list. Aside from causing injuries and the loss of man hours at work, these accidents bring about emotional distress to affected individuals. Stress is a factor that triggers short-and medium-term consequences which are in turn reflected in the quality of life of the patient and his/her family. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that causes psychosocial disfunctioning and appears due to the exposure to a stressor or traumatic event. It may come about in two ways: when the subject is a victim of a serious threat to his/her life or integrity and when the subject witnesses an event seriously affecting a third party. The main stressors may be natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, intentional attacks, such as rape or any form of criminal violence, and, as is the case here, from traumatic events caused by motor vehicles. The etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial and involves genetic, psychological, educational, and environmental aspects. It has three forms: severe, where the disorder appears immediately after the occurrence of the event or until a month later; chronic, lasting between one and three months; and delayed, where symptoms appear six months after the event. Our objective was to establish PTSD frequency in patients with physical injuries caused by motor vehicles accidents who were attended at the Regional Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital “Adolfo Lopez Mateos”. Together with the application of the scales, we were interested in making a description of the sociodemographical side of accidents, comparing the affect profile, and somehow defining the wide range of factors involved in the occurrence of this problem. For this, we devised a transversal and descriptive study with a non-probabilistic sampling. The sample was chosen using the following inclusion criteria: a)Being older than 18 years.",

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "abstract": "No es un secreto que estudiar medicina se caracteriza por tener altas cargas académicas, estar expuesto al sufrimiento de los pacientes y, en algunos casos, a sus muertes, lo que puede generar estrés y ansiedad. No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial. Adicionalmente, vivir una experiencia de aprendizaje con este tipo de tensiones puede desencadenar dificultades para la concentración y la memoria, procesos que son fundamentales para el éxito académico.",

This was found to be significantly higher in women who experienced a high-risk pregnancy or birth. PTSD presents with intrusive flashbacks, avoidance of triggering circumstances, fear, irritability, guilt and shame. There is also a significant group of women who do not meet the full PTSD criteria but who still experienced the birth as traumatic. When the experience of that traumatic birth causes ongoing distress, this is referred to as 'birth trauma.' Women with birth trauma do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD but do display symptoms of traumatic stress similar to those found in PTSD. Both medical interventions during childbirth and women's subjective feelings of poor-quality care have been identified as contributing factors to Birth Trauma and postnatal PTSD. Birth trauma has been found to be often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and fear of birth. Sometimes, that has led to PTSD being missed as the underlying issue, and the diagnosis of PTSD has been missed or delayed.",

      "abstract": "The recent plethora of lawsuits involving allegations of iatrogenically implanted memories of satanic ritual abuse and other traumas has highlighted the existence of a unique group of psychiatric patients. Although these patients are often successful at deceiving therapists (and sometimes juries), the case studies in this special issue reveal the chronic nature of their propensity to invent traumatic identities and past histories. The core clinical features of affect dysregulation, somatization, and impaired object relations, together with frequent histories of alcohol and substance abuse, parallel the psychiatric co-morbidity frequently found in genuine trauma victims. These case studies also point to early childhood problems in attachment, and sometimes to real childhood trauma, as possible etiologic factors. The current diagnostic system does not adequately capture the full range of these patients' psychopathology, which involves the creation of factitious identities and fictional traumatic personal histories. The particulars of these histories change over time as the patients incorporate, deliberately and/or “unconsciously,” details derived from outside sources. Although clearly susceptible to being influenced by authority figures of all kinds, it is evident from these case studies that the core psychopathology at work here is intrinsic to the patients and not the by-product of therapeutic misadventure.",

This lack of close contact has been to the detriment ofboth disciplines. Psychiatry, particularly work on the aetiology of mental disease, may profit from psychological theorizing and experimentation on normal functioning. Psychology, on the other hand, can gain important insights from the study of disturbed processes and the availability of natural experiments and controlled intervention programmes. In particular, theoretical, experimental and clinical work on the antecedents, manifestation, and control of emotional states, including their pathological forms, would benefit from closer collaboration between psychiatrists and psychologists",

Most studies were prospective cohort studies, including those providing the most data about etiology. In some studies, weak methods and analyses limited the conclusions. In addition, the methodologic criteria of the literature search excluded some well-known reports about this subject.Because of the small number of studies, there was inadequate evidence that chronic pain results from a prior psychiatric disorder (level 4a). The studies provided limited evidence (level 3) that chronic depression plays a role in the development of new pain locations (although not for low back pain); that prior nervousness and past negative life events predict work disability; and that depression, anxiety, and a sense that control rests outside of one's own self may predict slower recovery from pain and disability. These findings do not prove that psychological factors have a role in the development of chronic pain. Psychological impairment may precede the onset of pain. Based on current knowledge, it may also arise as a complication of chronic pain.",

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "abstract": "At first glance acute grief would not seem to be a clinical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word, but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. While there has been recognition for some time that certain commonly recurring events have important psychological and situational components, Lindemann's unique contribution has been to provide a theoretical framework by which these events and the human responses to them (adaptive and maladaptive) can be conceptualized, studied and treated. The situational problem conception suggests that casework problems are not really divided into problems that are external on the one hand or internal on the other; it supports the idea that all casework problems have a significant internal aspect.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is caused by an extreme event that occurs unexpectedly and suddenly, is life-threatening or is perceived to be so, and has an intense impact on the senses of the person involved. A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

      "title": "The Interplay between Pain, Anxiety and Depression",
      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience with two inseparable components: sensory and emotional. The personal property of pain experience makes it difficult to manage and treat due to the influence of genetics, age, gender, spiritual beliefs, social-economic status, and cultural factors. Similarly, medical care methods partly control pain experience and regulate pain progression. Contrary to chronic pain, which is continuous and recurrent, acute pain is primarily due to trauma, acute medical conditions, or treatment. Whatever the case, both can cause mood disorders. The interplay between mood disorders and pain upholds a progressively significant bidirectional link, as mood disorders and pain are risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety heighten pain perception or decrease pain tolerance. Acute or chronic pain can also increase the chances of mood dysregulation. Although depression and anxiety have a close relationship with acute pain, the interplay between depression and acute pain is more comprehensively studied. Most depressed patients present pain as their sole complaint in primary care practices, which unfortunately is overlooked by physicians. Howbeit, reports on experimentally induced pain perception in depressed patients are mixed, presenting both an amplified and reduced pain threshold and tolerance. Although there are less published data about pain and anxiety, the association is regular because increased anxiety equally increases pain perception while decreasing tolerance. The aim of this review was to elucidate more on the mechanisms delineating the interconnectivity of pain and mood disorders.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

Since the phenomenology of stress syndromes, as well as their emotional intensity, are highly variable, careful diagnosis is a first requirement. In studies into the significance of stress in the occurrence of depression this degree of finesse has not been achieved. The major shortcomings are discussed.

One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "abstract": "Increasing numbers of studies of correctional populations have emphasized diagnosis with structured clinical instruments over the past two decades. These studies have primarily focused on serious mental illness (i.e., psychotic and mood disorders), substance use disorders, and personality disorders. The focus has made sense because of the need to identify the severely mentally ill who are incarcerated and to identify the most common disorders. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias. One anxiety disorder that stands apart from others is PTSD, which is prevalent at much higher rates in both incarcerated men and women than in the community. Despite this fact, other anxiety disorders are often co-morbid and add to overall disease burden and impair ability to function. Individuals with a greater disease burden (i.e., number of diagnoses, symptom counts) have worse outcomes than those with uncomplicated disorders. These impaired outcomes include a deteriorating trajectory of illness, increased health service utilization, poor prognosis, and increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Thus, while anxiety disorders may not be the primary focus of the correctional system, they must be recognized as important. Unrecognized anxiety disorders can result in behavior that is disruptive and may appear to be volitional. They can also lead to overutilization of health services that are already facing substantial demands. Appropriate, available, and consistent assessment, diagnosis, and treatment that are well integrated can successfully intervene in the range of anxiety disorders that present in correctional settings.",

D’autres presentations de la maladie existent, masquees par \nles traits somatiques. A un stade ulterieur ou lorsque le malade presente des \ntraits pre-dementiels, les troubles confusionnels sont souvent precipites par la \ndepression. Les interrelations avec l’histoire de vie, le type de personnalite et \nl’environnement humain sont presentees dans cet article. Lorsqu’il existe une \nconfusion, l’epreuve therapeutique par antidepresseur, peut aider au diagnostic \ndifferentiel d’avec une demence debutante, sans trancher definitivement un \nrisque d’evolution dementiel ulterieur.",

SAD can interfere considerably with social, family, and academic functioning and often leads to age‐inappropriate behaviors. SAD should not be confused with separation anxiety, which occurs as a normal stage of development during the first year of life, when infants begin to understand that they are separate from their primary caregiver.",

      "abstract": "The exact cause of the anxiety disorders is unknown. There is, however, considerable evidence that a deep brain structure, the amygdala, is intricately involved with the development of anxiety behavior. The amygdala is thought to mediate the fear response in the brain when an individual is confronted with real or perceived danger [2]. The response of the amygdala to a threat is to create the “fight or flight” response, which includes adrenal catecholamine release, increased heart rate, glycogenolysis, and shunting of blood from the gut. Theory holds that the inappropriate activation or dysregulation of the “fight or flight” response leads to autonomic discharge, which, in turn, produces the symptom complex common to many anxiety disorders. It is frequently recognized that many medical illnesses and conditions are associated with a certain degree of anxiety. The uncertainty surrounding the experience of illness and its treatment can elicit anxiety in many patients, much of which is expected and natural.

These symptoms typically dissipate over time, but the presence of PEs is associated with an elevated risk of developing a clinical psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. In addition, PEs show associations with neuropsychological impairment and disturbances in brain structure and function. It is thought that PEs are driven by similar neurodevelopmental and environmental mechanisms, but it is unclear how similar the underlying pathways are. This chapter will discuss the cognitive difficulties and differences in brain structure and function associated with PEs. Then, it will examine these in relation to typical neurodevelopment and the course of impairment towards clinical psychotic disorders.",

Craniocervical anatomical and physiological features are a basis for development of mixed pain syndromes showing as a polymorphic clinical picture in the presence of not only painful, but also tonic muscle, autonomic, postural, vestibular, and other disorders. The current concept of cervicocranialgia is based on the views and convergence between cranial (trigeminal) and upper cervical afferents, as supported by clinical and experimental data. These mechanisms are responsible for referred pain phenomena that are so characteristic of myofascial pain syndromes in the neck, head, and face. Myofascial pain may both be independent and occur in other types of primary headaches, specifically in migraine and tension headache. In these cases, the clinical symptomatology takes the features that are highly characteristic of myofascial pain: referred pain with a typical pattern of its spread, as well as trigger points and pain associated with postural loads and other physical factors. These peculiarities should be kept in mind when diagnosing pain syndromes in the craniocervical region. Current approaches to managing patients with cervicocranialgias encompass relief of pain and tonic muscle disorders and compensation for postural disturbances. For this, it is customary to use pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and myorelaxants. Effective analgesia in these patients still remains an unsolved problem. Analysis of clinical trials can identify the most effective analgesic and safe agents for pharmacotherapy. The phenomena of myofascial pain determine the expediency of using myorelaxants that exert an intrinsic analgesic effect and reduce tonic muscle phenomena.",

The forms of delusion range from mis-attribution of identity related to self, other, as well as parts of the body. Although rare, these syndromes are encountered in a number of different forms by medical and psychiatric personnel, as well as other types of mental health workers. This is especially true since many of the syndromes have organic etiology and are treated via medical rather than psychological intervention. Nevertheless, delusional mis-identification syndromes often co-exist with psychiatric issues which can be helped by concurrent psychological treatment. Given that identity is central to human beings and their cultures, it is not surprising that delusional mis-identification is represented in a number of cultural beliefs. Some cultural expressions of delusional mis-identification may function as coping mechanisms for anxiety over loss of identity or the trauma of infant mortality.",

One must be sure there is no gross lesion, such as a compression fracture of a vertebra or a fracture of the transverse or spinous processes. Good roentgenograms, both anteroposterior and lateral, will settle that. One must also be sure that there is not some destructive bone disease, such as tuberculosis or cancer.

A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided.

      "abstract": "In the perinatal period, fathers may also suffer from depression, referred to as paternal perinatal depression. Studies have shown that the prevalence of paternal perinatal depression is considerably higher than in the general adult population. For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

Disease categories should only be regarded as valid if they can be shown to be discrete entities with natural boundaries that separate them from other disorders. Even more uncertain are the boundaries between anxiety, depression and somatization in primary care. Mental health disorders may be \"valid\" but not useful in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Sensitization is conceptually related to cognitive bias in experimental psychopathology, and they share the basic mechanism of neuronal sensitization. Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

The study of its etiology, usually, signs to situations where the individual is feeling weak, especially related to losses, mourning and melancholy. The emotional aspect seems to play great importance in the etiology, and that is the reason why it is considered a psychosomatic disease. In this context, the pain appears as a repetition of some experience already lived before, that repeats again in unconscious way. This study had the aim to articulate the theoretical presuppositions of medicine and of psychoanalysis to get a more deep understanding about the enigma that is expressed in the fibromyalgia. This disease, in medical aspects, has defined its characteristics, the methods of diagnosis and treatment, even though the etiology remains unknown. On the other hand, the psychoanalysis shows as cause of this disease, the difficulties in the psychicological structure organization, especially, the failure of the paternal function and the difficulties of the subject to deal with his anguish, his demands and his desires. In the expression of the disease, one can observe clearly the connection mind-body in its genesis – psychosomatic disease, and, therefore, it must be studied the diagnosis and the treatment according to the rules established by psychosomatic, aiming at a clinical action that allows the subject to rescue his well-being, through the overcoming of his misunderstanding, his impasses and, consequently, the existential pain.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental disorders when it comes to children and adolescents. The core feature of these disorders is a level of anxiety and fears that is not appropriate for that stage of development in a child which leads to anxiety disorders having a significant impact on disrupting daily activities of a child. It is important to monitor children’s fears within the context of their development. Estimations show that approximately 10 to 20% of all children develop some kind of anxiety disorders. They are present with the children of both sexes, although some anxiety disorders have shown to be featured more often in girls. Anxiety disorders can be diagnosed after the age of six. Early discovery and proper treatment can significantly help with the possible negative effects these disorders have on social and family life as well as on a child’s performance in school. Anxiety disorders are comorbid conditions with other psychiatric disorders. Anxiety is manifested in the form of bodily, psychological, cognitive and behavioural changes. When it comes to etiology, a variety of factors are present, with the causes of anxiety disorders still not fully known, but both psychiatric and general medical factors are involved. Clinical studies, as well as every day practice, have shown that most effective results yield when cognitive- behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with prescription medication is utilized. Cognitive therapy bases its approach on identifying and replacing negative thinking patterns and behaviours with positive ones while behavioural techniques aim to change behavioural patterns in children with anxiety disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first choice when it comes to medication therapy as they are proven time and time again to be the most effective in anxiety disorders. When diagnosed early and using a proper treatment, anxiety disorders can be reduced to a minimum as to not cause any damage to the child’s life. It is crucial in children and adolescents psychiatry for the success of the treatment for parents or guardians to be heavily involved in all stages of treating the disorder, from planning to practicing techniques proposed by the physician.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "abstract": "Any acute state of dyspnoea will lead to feelings of insecurity and anxiety. In this context the paper elucidates the conceptual horizon of anxiety, stretching from its status as «normal», essential element of conditio humana, to representing a symptom of another (somatic or mental) illness and to constituting a psychiatric disorder of its own. In any case of acute dyspnoea it is important to «normalize» the patient's anxiety, i.e. to contextualize it as a comprehensible reaction to the stressing experience and not as proof of personal weakness. If dyspnoea and anxiety occur in a patient with a preexisting psychiatric disorder, defining the appropriate therapeutic steps will be more complex and demanding, especially with regard to a targeted interdisciplinary cooperation (consultation liaison psychiatry). The paper highlights the principles of psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutical interventions, a stable therapeutical relationship always defining the center of any treatment procedure.Dyspnoe und Angst.Eine akut auftretende Dyspnoe, auf Deutsch nicht ohne Grund meist «Atemnot» genannt, löst immer Verunsicherung und Angst aus. Der Beitrag leuchtet in diesem Kontext den Horizont des Phänomens Angst aus. Dieser reicht vom «normalen», essentiellen Element der conditio humana über den Status als Symptom einer anderen (somatischen oder psychischen) Erkrankung bis hin zur Angst als eigenständiger psychischer Erkrankung. In der somatischen Akutsituation einer Dyspnoe kommt der «Normalisierung» von Angst eine besondere Bedeutung zu, also das Einordnen der Angst als nachvollziehbare Reaktion auf die Belastung und nicht etwa als Ausdruck persönlicher Schwäche. Treten Dyspnoe und Angst bei einer Person mit einer vorbestehenden psychischen Erkrankung auf, stellen sich bei der Therapie besondere Herausforderungen, vor allem hinsichtlich einer gezielten interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit (Konsil- und Liaisonpsychiatrie). Die Prinzipien psychopharmakologischer und psychotherapeutischer Interventionen werden herausgearbeitet, wobei die tragfähige therapeutische Beziehung stets im Zentrum steht.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD.

In this paper we propose to review the physiopathology, clinical features and diagnostic procedures of these crises.There are three types of reflex anoxic cerebral crises: asphyxiating anoxic crises, ischemic anoxic crises and asphyxiating-ischemic anoxic crises. They are caused by sudden activation of the so-called syncopal reflex. They are characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and may often be mistaken for epileptic crises. They are related to various precipitating factors such as a blow, often to the head, an emotional stimulus or something which upsets or molests, hyperthermia, abdominal pain, headache, physical exertion, prolonged standing-up, exposure to heat, the sight of blood, feeling of fear and other factors.Important elements for the diagnosis of these crises are the presence of a family history of vagal crises, the presence of precipitating factors, brief duration of the crises (seconds) in most patients, and clinical signs of facial or perioral pallor or cyanosis. The test involving pressure on the eyeball and the tilting table are useful for diagnosis. However, they should be used sensibly.",

On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

In-depth descriptions of the signs and symptoms of mood disorders are covered under emotional, cognitive, psychomotor, and vegetative subheadings. We finally give coverage to the chronic and subthreshold mood disorders, including dysthymia and cyclothymia.

ASD occurs immediately after the stressor and is comparatively short-lived, while PTSD is a prolonged abnormal response that may take months to develop. The types of stressor leading to ASD and PTSD are identical and were intended to be tightly defined, involving a perceived threat of death, serious injury or loss of physical integrity. It is useful initially to distinguish ASD and PTSD from adjustment disorders, which are also diagnosed only after an observable life event. An adjustment disorder may be thought of as a gradual and prolonged response to stressful changes in a person's life. The range of stressors precipitating an adjustment disorder is potentially much broader than that precipitating ASD or PTSD, as a threat of death or injury is not needed. Indeed, a 'threat' as such is not needed, as the event may be a loss. Events such as job loss or the breakup of a relationship may lead to an adjustment disorder, as well as threats such as accidents or assaults. The diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder do not specify what the immediate response, if any, to the precipitating stressor must be.",

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

They include feeling a sense of peace, of seeing a bright light, encountering deceased relatives or religious figures, and of transcending space and time. To explain them, it has been suggested that they stem from brain disorders and/or psychological reactions to approaching death, a sort of wishful thinking in response to the perceived threat. This is a report on a case with most of the features typical of NDEs except that it occurred entirely without any life-threatening conditions. This evidence is theoretically incompatible with either of the above hypotheses, suggesting that a broader interpretation of the phenomenon is needed.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Despite these facts, it is a symptom that can be difficult to quantify and difficult to distinguish from dyspnea, the other hallmark symptom of heart failure. It is a subjective complaint that has no single objective test to measure it. In addition, it can be multifactorial in origin. It is not adequately explained by a reduced cardiac output alone, and other factors such as peripheral muscle and vasculature abnormalities, neuroendocrine changes, depression, side effects of therapy, sleep disturbances, and other concomitant diseases all need to be considered as etiologic factors.",

Psychosomatic factors should be given special attention during interviews. For a correct picture to be obtained, the help of a specially trained worker i.e. a psychiatrist or psychologist, should be enlisted. Factors and casual relationships can then be uncovered which remain problems to doctors not thus specialized. The two series dealt with in this study illustrate this clearly. Summarizing the observations made, Menière patients subjected to careful psychic and somatic analysis are found to have a predisposing psychosomatic constitution which, under chronic or acute stress, leads to such somatic manifestations as, in their turn, seem to presuppose a certain somatic predisposition—in this particular case evidently in the ear. Chronic stress seems to impair prognosis, a fact not difficult to understand considering that the mode of reaction depends upon the constitution, which—obviously—is of fairly permanent nature.",

      "title": "Selected Physiological Dimensions of Communication Apprehension",
      "abstract": "Abstract Communication apprehension (CA) is generally defined as a predisposition to avoid communication, if possible, or experience anxiety symptoms when forced to communicate with others. CA was conceptualized as a trait-like tendency to respond, meaning that the inclination to avoid communication or experience anxiety during social interaction was fairly stable across time. State anxiety, on the other hand, is transitory in nature, and while it often represents the manifestation of CA, it can be triggered by situational factors even in communicators low in the trait. Although the construct was initially conceptualized as a cognitively experienced trait, the psychological literature on anxiety symptoms usually includes physiological symptoms. Indeed, studies published since the initial development of the CA construct have indicated that state anxiety experienced during communication is correlated with physiological measures. More recent work indicates that trait CA, while not typically correlated with measures such as heart rate, is correlated with stable, individual differences in brain activity. This chapter focuses on the complex theoretical and empirical relationships among physiological responses, trait CA, and communication state anxiety.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

      "abstract": "Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. Stress is defined as perspective of mind or as mental health disorder. It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations. Sometimes it plays as a motivating factor for peak performance and great opportunity, or sometimes negative like when a person faces social, physical, organizational, and emotional problems.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by two components: recurrent panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

These always have certain characteristic features which permit their diagnosis as organic psychotic reactions implanted on the psychosis for which the patient is being treated; they disappear within one or two weeks after the last treatment.

      "abstract": "Pain in the back and lower limbs due to lumbar disorders has a multifactorial etiology, and there is no clear relationship between the morbid pathological change observed and the symptoms experienced. Of the precipitating factors, unaccustomed heavy work, postural fatigue, and injury are common. \"Back injury,\" however, embodies a variety of phenomena, few of which can readily be distinguished either in national statistical data or in previous epidemiologic studies. Thus the causal relationship between back pain and work is far from clear, a difficulty compounded by the prevalence of back symptoms in all groups of the population. There are few epidemiologically established methods for identifying people who are susceptible to a first attack of back pain, though, once back pain has been reported, recurrence may be predicted. Selection of the preventive approach depends on reliable information about the prevalence of back pain/discomfort, the back injury rate, sickness absence, etc; about accidents, work stoppages, job turnover, or any other pointers to the design of the workplace or work practices; and about the resulting losses of productivity and the costs of the remedy. Though the decisions are up to management, the quality of the information required is mainly an occupational health responsibility.",

      "abstract": "The influence of anxiety and depression on cardiovascular disease is well-known in terms of chronic cardiovascular and ischemic states. It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it.

Studies find that psychological distress is common after disasters and can (under certain circumstances) extend for long periods of time after the disaster has occurred. Yet, most people are psychologically resilient even in the face of catastrophic events. This entry focuses on research into the impacts of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, volcanic eruptions, and floods. Disaster scholars argue that disasters are rooted in the social structure of societies; thus, impacts and responses to disasters vary by social group, circumstances, and community context. The most commonly observed psychological impacts of disasters in the literature are post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, with some attention to substance abuse. Some research has also examined physical impacts of stress after disaster, in particular myocardial infarction.",

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

      "title": "Mental Stress and Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "As our understanding of the multifactorial etiology of cardiovascular (CV) disorders evolves, the important role of behavioral and psychological factors in the development, prevention, and management of cardiac disease is increasingly appreciated. The link between mental stress and adverse cardiac events has been long recognized. A growing body of epidemiological observations has demonstrated that acute emotional stress may trigger angina, myocardial infarction (MI), or sudden death, whereas chronic exposure to stress contributes to the pathobiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). Experimental models have enabled quantification of the cardiac effects of psychological factors and allowed for detailed investigation of the underlying mechanisms. Of clinical relevance, interventions that reduce stress or improve stress management appear to be protective against CV events in addition to their efficacy in improving patient well-being and psychological parameters. Robust evidence supports the concept that acute mental stress may trigger an acute cardiac event or even sudden cardiac death. Epidemiological reports indicate that the incidence of acute coronary syndromes rises sharply in the setting of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Similar to these infrequent, extreme scenarios, acute behavioral and emotional stressors encountered in everyday life (eg, anger or conflict) have also been implicated as potential triggers of myocardial ischemia and MI, malignant arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death in patients with CAD. Consistent with the observations related to acute stress, chronic stressful conditions including occupation stressors, social relationships, and environmental stimuli have been linked to the development and progression of cardiac pathology, particularly CAD. The association between anxiety and CAD was initially demonstrated in patients with psychiatric disorders, but similar associations have also been found in general populations. Large-scale, community-based studies and prospective investigations have demonstrated a strong, dose-dependent association between anxiety disorders and cardiac death, particularly among men. The INTERHEART study demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the incidence of MI in relation to chronic stressors, even after adjusting for established risk factors such as age, gender, and smoking. The association between mental stress and CV risk appears to be comparable with, or even stronger than, the wellestablished risk conferred by hypercholesterolemia. In the Framingham study, relative risks were 1.3 for total cholesterol levels between 200 and 239 mg/dL and 1.9 for total cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL. Notably, risk gradients in relation to psychological stressors are comparable to the risk gradient of elevated cholesterol. Evidence exists that the association between mental stress and CV morbidity and mortality may in part be mediated by increased exposure to organic risk factors. Individuals exposed to psychological stressors are prone to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors including smoking, changes in dietary habits, increased intake of calories, decreased physical activity, manifestation of the so-called type-A personality, increased alcohol intake, higher coffee intake, and adverse changes in sleeping habits. These unfavorable behavioral responses may in part be responsible for the documented link between anxiety and CAD. Mental stress, however, also exerts direct effects on CV pathophysiology, characterized by marked sympathetic nervous system activation and release of catecholamines and corticosteroids. These neuroendocrine responses increase heart rate and blood pressure (BP), promote endothelial dysfunction, provoke vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic coronary arteries, and favor platelet activation and hypercoagulation. Together these pathobiological responses favor a proatherogenic and prothrombotic milieu that may contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis in the long-term and may increase myocardial oxygen demand and thus cause",

Reaction to pain cannot be easily generalized; group differences are postulated, based on sex, age, culture, psychiatric diagnosis and personality variables. Early developmental aspects of pain and discussed in animal studies and case reports but little systematic data exist. Experimental findings show the influence on pain response of cognitive and emotional factors. Clinically, the variables determining perception, reporting and reaction to pain are numerous and harder to study scientifically. Acute and chronic pain should be distinguished: the latter is more complicated, leading of ten to diagnostic problems and management stalemates. Discovering the relationship of pain to emotional phenomena, as cause or effect, is difficult, though essential to effective treatment. Various frames of reference apply: e.g., individual medical, familial, and \"workmen's compensation\" models. Reaction by family, lawyer, or work commission involves potential secondary gain and may reinforce or discourage pathological responses by the patient. The potential of pain for symbolic meaning and its acceptance as a \"legitimate\" medical symptom renders it ideal for both expression and masquerading of intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts involving anger, punishment, control and dependency. Teaching about pain and its significance is best done in clinical settings such as obstetrical units and multidisciplinary pain clinics. Videotaped modular presentations with discussion provide a satisfactory though less desirable alternative.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of the affective disorders (disorders of mood rather than disturbances of thought or cognition); it may range from a very mild condition, bordering on normality, to severe (psychotic) depression accompanied by hallucinations and delusions. Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology. This distinction is made clinically, but there is little evidence that antidepressant drugs show significant selectivity between these conditions.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved.

Sociocultural factors have an important role in the manifestations, help-seeking, and management of these chronic pain and somatizing syndromes. Some specific pain syndromes and somatizing syndromes are seen in India, including that syndrome, sinking heart syndrome, and a variety of somatic neuroses.

Equally important is the relationship of physical factors in the genesis of ‘psychological’ disorders. So intimately related are the two categories of causes and of effects that their separation amounts, in principle, to a falsification of the issue—a recourse to dogmatic artificiality. In modern psychological and psychiatric circles the differentiation of psyche and soma has come to be recognized as a gratuitous over-simplification that cannot do justice to the essential facts. A sick man is a sick man whether his illness arises primarily in structural defects or in his life experiences. It is less than scientific to confine attention to either the somatic or the psychological facet of the total individual. The physician is doing less than his full duty to the patient when he fails to give his attention to the real etiology, whatever it may be, and to utilize appropriate therapeutic agencies of any legitimate sort whether drugs, hormones, physical therapy, re-education, or what not.",

Many kinds of cerebral palsy are difficult to detect or, at least, diagnostically differentiate in the first few months of life. The complexity and uncertainty surrounding cerebral palsy have been outlined in order that the following, necessarily simplified, descriptive account is seen as a great deal tidier than the reality.

      "abstract": "The distinction between normal and abnormal behaviors depends on many factors: economic, social, biological, …. As a society gets more developed and informed, the frontier between moral, religious or social problems and psychiatric disease tends to be a frequent object of reflection. In the past many medical conditions (such as epilepsy, mania and several psychosis) were inicially considered moral or social problems. On the other side, nowadays, Psychiatry is often asked to act in disruptive situation: difficulty in controlling impulses, aggressive behaviors and criminality. The authors present some case studies of personality disorders, in which the principal symptom at admission was violent behavior. The psychiatric action was limited by therapeutic solutions and ethic issues. According to literature there’s an association between personality disorders and criminal behavior. Antisocial personality is a strong predictor of violence and aggression. The clinical cases presented confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Symptoms are the body's major signaling device, but symptoms often are frustratingly vague, subjective, and ill reported. In addition, challenges attend making decisions about an individual's ability to function based solely on the medical diagnosis, particularly when impairment is subtle or subjective. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a model for understanding the limits of the medical approach to determining impairment and disability. A protocol from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is used to define CFS. This protocol is not a list of diagnostic criteria, and some patients with chronic fatigue may not meet the CDC definition. The syndrome reflects dysfunction in the neuroendocrine system similar in some ways to that seen with depressive illness, and most patients seen for this condition fulfill the criteria for depression, which is another illness characterized by fatigue and somatic complaints. Physicians who evaluate and treat patients with subtle persistent illness know that employers and coworkers respond less positively to an employee's needs when illness is subtle than when impairment is obvious. Physicians must be clear about the family, job, and employment risks patients take when they stay out of work for medical reasons; they also must recognize the risk these patients take when they continue to work despite impaired performance.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

Since an individual considers himself in good health until something arises which interferes with or embarrasses his capacity for work or pleasure, it is therefore a symptom or symptoms which usually first induce him to seek medical advice. Such sensations or symptoms are the first manifestations of disordered or embarrassed function and frequently are complained of before anatomic changes are detectable.

      "abstract": "Purpose: The paper deals with the issues of occupational fatigue. One of the features of the work model adopted in recent years is that employees work more than forty hours a week. This results in greater fatigue, which over time may turn into severe fatigue. Then we cannot cope with our work tasks and we are also mentally less resistant to various types of stressful situations, which deepens the feeling of fatigue and exhaustion. Chronically tired people usually suffer from insomnia, which deepens problems with the already disturbed circadian rhythm and does not allow us to have a sufficient rest. Strong and constant fatigue, described as exhaustion, is a signal that your body needs some rest. Chronic fatigue may also indicate the presence of a disease. The purpose of this paper is to highlight this very important problem. Design/methodology/approach: Literature research of the subject was carried out. Findings: They fatigue also increase the risk of accidents, defects or mistakes at work. Fatigue itself is not a disease, but only a symptom. According to general practitioners, chronic fatigue, which persists for no apparent reason, is currently one of the most common health problems reported by their patients. Unfortunately, diagnosing and treating this condition is not easy due to the large number of possible causes and risk factors. Practical implications: The issues discussed in this paper significantly affect the improvement of methods related to work environment management and the desired shaping of employees’ attitudes and behavior regarding the approach to the problem of being tired at work, a problem related to work environment that has been downplayed so far. Originality/value: A holistic approach to the issues of occupational fatigue. Defining it as an interdisciplinary problem. It should be dealt with by doctors of various specialties, especially in occupational medicine, of course, but also general practitioners, neurologists, gastroenterologists, and cardiologists. It also requires the attention of non-medical specialists, including psychologists and physiologists. Keywords: company management, occupational fatigue, human factor.

      "abstract": "Abstract Several illnesses expressed somatically that do not have clearly demonstrated pathophysiological origin and that are associated with neuropsychological complaints are reviewed. Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

Such evidence is poor also because suicidal patients were systematically excluded from clinical trials, for ethical reasons. Several key ideas are important in the management of the suicidal person. First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

Objectives Increase knowledge about paraphrenia, a classic diagnosis that no longer appears on international classifications. Methods Extensive research on the historical path of the paraphrenia diagnostic entity was carried out. Patient’s data is obtained from medical history and psychiatric interviews done during her hospitalizations. Results 68 year-old patient attended the hospital emergency service due to a demonic possession delusion that emerged when she was 44 year-old, when she first consulted a psychiatrist because she believed someone introduced the demon inside her body. She described kinesthetic hallucinations as “movements of her brain” and an intense headache, both originated by the demon; as well as other types of hallucinations and confabulations. However, there was no deterioration in her personaliy or her intellectual capacity, as it could have been seen in a case of schizophrenia. This clinical case is considered a paraphrenia phantastica as it presents the typical features raised by the classic authors (mainly Henry Ey): paralogical thought dominance, megalomania, confabulation and integrity of relation with reality. Conclusions Current internacional classifications do not consider paraphrenia as a differentiated diagnostic entity, as it also occurs with other classical entities. This causes a loss of important tools that would achieve a better approach to the patient’s condition. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

In no branch of medicine is a good history more important than in neurology. It makes all the difference in the diagnosis of a difficult case in which the physical signs may not be in doubt. Time spent on it is well worth while. The poor witness can be helped by leading questions. After taking the detailed history it should be possible to list the probable site or sites of the nervous system affected, from muscle to cerebral cortex. Also, from the course of development of the symptoms (for example, whether episodic or progressive), it should be possible to suggest the likely pathological diagnosis. For example, vascular lesions tend to cause sudden or episodic symptoms; cerebral tumours more often cause slowly progressive symptoms.",

Both diagnoses require 2 months of prospective symptom ratings, which can be accomplished using forms designed by individual clinicians or employing 1 of a number of validated instruments. The patient will need to provide a complete family and personal history of mental disorders and medical diseases. A thorough physical examination and certain basic laboratory tests should either identify or rule out many potential causes of the symptoms. The diseases, disorders or situations considered in the differential diagnosis of PMS and PMDD will depend on the woman's presenting symptoms. Many women with a bothersome or debilitating premenstrual disorder go undiagnosed, either because they do not report their symptoms to a clinician or because the clinician has difficulty diagnosing the disorder.",

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect.

      "abstract": "Approximately 50% of people treated for depression receive treatment in primary care settings. However, studies have demonstrated that specific factors interfere with recognition of this disorder in the primary care setting and decrease the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis. Variables that relate to the patient include lack of awareness and understanding of the nature of the disease and its symptoms so that they can be accurately reported to the physician. Variability in clinical presentation and the presence of comorbid medical disorders also make detection difficult. Complaints of physical symptoms confuse the clinical picture. In addition, patients are ashamed to admit to psychological symptoms of depression and fear the stigma attached to it. Interfering factors that relate to the physician include a lack of knowledge about the disease and lack of training in its management that reduce the physician's ability to render a diagnosis and undermine confidence in the capacity to treat the illness successfully. Reluctance on the part of the physician to inquire frankly about depression also plays a role. Barriers that stem from the system include financing of care under capitated systems, other reimbursement issues, time available to care for patients, and continuity of the physician/patient relationship. A variety of tools are available to assist primary care physicians in the recognition and accurate diagnosis of depression. Use of these tools would increase the recognition and effective management of depression.",

This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

This review gives an overview of neurophysiologic studies that indicate different pathogenic mechanisms for different types of psychosis. Convergent and complementary structural and functional imaging findings, biochemical and neuropsychological data allow conjecture as to neurophysiologic-psychopathologic links in cycloid psychosis. Intriguing results suggest that in cycloid psychosis, a generalized hyperasousal related to the tonus of the noradrenergic system may be the basic disturbance causing the delusionary and perceptual psychotic distortions. The findings are specific for cycloid psychoses, which are diagnosed as polymorphous psychosis in the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the author's hypothesis that the emotional derailment is the primary disturbance in cycloid psychosis (anxiety-elation). In contrast, cognitive disturbances are secondary and remit after the exceptional emotional state is rebalanced .",

Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes.

Many etiologic factors, extraneural in origin, deserve a prominent place in such a discussion, but in this connection attention is chiefly directed to those conditions in which pain is the result of an involvement of the nervous system. The neurologist, for one or many reasons, is constantly called on to determine the cause of pain. This situation has arisen as a result of the concurrent action of a considerable number of factors, the most weighty of which is perhaps the prevalence of pain as a symptom of a functional disturbance.

      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop following exposure to a traumatic event, including terrifying or life-threatening situations such as sexual assault or natural disasters.The disorder is characterized by a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror when the individual experiences, testifies about, or is faced with one or more events that involve death, severe wounds, or a threat to one's own or another's physical integrity.One of the most important symptoms of PTSD is the revival of the traumatic event, which has been interpreted as an inability to downregulate negative emotions.Neuroimaging studies that probed the ability to regulate emotions in healthy volunteers have found a pattern characterized by activation of the prefrontal cortex associated with a reduction in amygdala activity.This suggests an inhibitory prefrontal cortexamygdala circuit that underlies emotional regulation.The hypothesis that increased amygdala activation associated with PTSD results from dysfunction in the inhibitory mechanism exerted by the prefrontal cortex has been the topic of debate.The present review investigates the validity of dysfunction in the prefrontal-amygdala pathway in PTSD.The studies provide evidence that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex exhibit distinct activation patterns in PTSD, thus supporting the model of a dysfunctional circuit.Inconsistencies in the literature may be attributable to distinct PTSD subgroups, different experimental approaches, different contrasts employed in neuroimaging studies, and small sample sizes.",

      "abstract": "Among older persons, the prevalence of a depressive disorder is high. Almost half of the depressed patients suffer from significant anxiety symptoms. In clinical practice this combination of depression and anxiety is challenging as high levels of anxiety in depression are associated with more impairment and a worse prognosis. Anxiety in late-life depression has many faces. It can represent itself in a physical or mental form, like tension or worry. With all its complications it can also be categorized as a separate anxiety disorder, like a panic disorder or a generalized anxiety disorder. Many former studies that examined this so-called ‘anxious depression’ did not differentiate between depression with high levels of anxiety and a depression with a concurrent anxiety disorder.Our general message stresses the importance to differentiate between these depressive states. Different characteristics are found, like certain personality traits or the impact of life-events. These characteristics differentiate even further when we look at separate concurrent anxiety disorders. The combination of anxiety and depression shows a less favorable course and has a negative impact on complete remission over a period of two years. In one of the studies, we investigated the feasibility of a method of intensive repeated measurements. The patient reported about her depressive and anxiety symptoms five times a day during her daily activities. This provided a detailed insight in her symptom dynamics and stimulated a dialogue on possible treatment targets and interventions.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can be developed after a person was exposed to life treating experience or experience that is continuing to happen. There are different kinds of trauma or stresses. There are some that are cause by natural disaster, some by warfare trauma, violence on civilians, sexual assault, physical assault, psychological assault and others. PTSD was first described on soldiers who participated in the American civil war. Mental problems in soldiers which took part in the First World War, experts of that era considered functional and labeled the term grenade shock. Upon completion of the Second World War, the observed psychological disturbances of war participants were termed uncommon acute PTSDs occur within 3 months of the traumatic event, and chronic PTSD occurs after 3 or more months and in the postponed PTSD the symptoms occur 6 months after the traumatic event. Treatment of PTSD involves biological, social and psychological therapy. One that stands the most in these types of psychological disorder is psychological one. There are different approaches for it, it can be run as an individual conversation with a psychiatrist or in a way of group therapies that indicates larger progress in behavior of people in everyday life. There are different kinds of diagnosis analysis that can be done for this type of disorders. International classification MKB-10 is primarily used for classification of sickens and cause of deaths, while DSM-V is used for diagnosis of mental disorder behavior, and it is used on global scale. Advantage of specific group therapy primarily depends on the fact that individual has a chance to verbalize feelings without the fear of being judge, without the fear of non-acceptance. With that kind of activity, the progress of the emotional state of the person in hand, comes progress. With an individual progress there is a possibility that all members of the group learn about there own patterns of that behavior, and that they can see there reactions which are going to be positive or negative. Group psychotherapy is a method that uses group members to give feedback to the individual about his behavior and his emotional state. The advantage and specificity of this type of therapy is most in the sense that an individual has the opportunity to verbalize his feelings without fear of condemnation, prejudice and disapproval. The role of a nurse on people who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder is very broad in scope. Starting from communication skills to more complex beginnings of sister care for such patients. There is a great deal of empathy, knowledge and patience for such work. The nurses have first contact with the patient and are carrying it 24 hours a day. The nurse takes data for the sister's history by talking to family members and the patient himself. A nurse is a member of a therapeutic team and has to know the psychic disorder and recognize the patient's needs that the health care aspect can accomplish.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

Depresi merupakan contoh manifestasi aspek psikis yang kerap dijumpai pada pasien penyakit dalam, dengan kekerapan yang bergantung pada karakteristik sosio-demografis dan durasi penyakit yang dialami.1 Kebanyakan penyakit di bidang ilmu penyakit dalam merupakan penyakit kronis. Sembuh terkadang bukanlah target yang diharapkan, namun keadaan terkontrolnya penyakit (yang dalam istilah medis disebut dengan remisi atau terkendali) sering merupakan target terapi yang ingin dicapai. Hal ini berimplikasi pada perlunya pemantauan dan pengobatan jangka panjang, bahkan pada beberapa kasus seumur hidup. Pada pasien penyakit kronis, depresi akan mempengaruhi cara pasien memandang dan menerima (cope) penyakit fisik yang dialami, serta menentukan bagaimana pasien berinteraksi dengan keluarga, dokter penyakit dalam, juga dengan pengobatan yang harus secara rutin dijalani pasien.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A 29-year-old man had a chronic history of muscle fasciculations and painful muscle contractions triggered suddenly after extreme exertion. His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

This publication provides an update on the origins and the causes of anxiety disorders and their related symptoms. Its focus is on neuroimaging and neuroinflammation and genetics as well as areas where an overlap may exist with abnormal cardiovascular physiology. Further it takes a closer look at the early phases of anxiety disorder and the potential effects of prolonged illness prior to diagnosis and also investigates recent research findings about the neuroimmunology of depression and the immunomodulatory effects of antidepressants. It also examines the neuroinflammatory hypothesis about anxiety disorders and concludes with the succinct but evidence-based and comprehensive reports on the value of pharmacological treatments used for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The topics covered in this publication will certainly make it essential reading for both novice and expert practitioners in psychiatric medicine, but its appeal should extend even further and include those researching the neuropsychobiology of anxiety or trying to improve our grasp of posttraumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain: What Does It Mean? A Review on the Use of the Term Chronic Pain in Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic pain is nowadays used as an umbrella term referring to a wide range of clinical conditions, such as fibromyalgia, migraine, or long-standing pain states without actual known causes. However, labeling a patient's clinical condition with the term \"chronic pain\", when dealing with pain lasting longer than 3 months, might be misleading. This paper aims at analyzing the possible pitfalls related to the use of the term \"chronic pain\" in the clinical field. It appears, indeed, that the term \"chronic pain\" shows a semantic inaccuracy on the basis of emerging scientific evidences on the pathogenesis of different long-standing pain states. The major pitfalls in using this label emerge in clinical settings, especially with patients having a biomedical perspective on pain or from different cultures, or with healthcare providers of other medical specialties or different disciplines. A label solely emphasizing temporal features does not help to discern the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, whose onset, maintenance and exacerbation are influenced by a complex and interdependent set of bio-psycho-social factors. Thus, finding a more meaningful name might be important. We call upon the necessity of bringing awareness and implementing educational activities for healthcare providers, as well as for the public, on the biopsychosocial approach to assess, prevent and care of chronic pain. Further research on the etiopathogenetic processes of chronic pain states is also required, together with examinative diagnostic methods, to individuate the most appropriate label(s) representing the complex long-standing pain states and to avoid adopting the term \"chronic pain\" inappropriately.

Kellner's Illness Attitude Scales, self-rating instruments, distinguish between generic worry about illness, concern about pain, health habits, hypochondriacal beliefs, thanatophobia, disease phobia, and bodily preoccupations. The Illness Attitude Scales have been used in a number of studies concerned with patients suffering from DSM-III-R hypochondriasis, panic disorder, melancholia, in the medically ill, in pregnant women, during medical procedures such as mammography, and in experiments in therapeutics, such as drug trials. The results of these studies and of clinical investigations suggest that the differential diagnosis between hypochondriacal beliefs (characterized by resistance to reassurance), disease phobia, thanatophobia, and the other less specific illness attitudes, is worthy of clinical attention and may entail prognostic and therapeutic implications. Pilowsky's concept of abnormal illness behavior, unlike the DSM-III-R, provides a framework for such differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that pain is not simply a function of the amount of bodily damage alone, but is influenced by attention, anxiety, suggestion, and other psychological variables. The gate control theory proposes than pain signals from the body are modulated by other, concurrent somatic inputs as well as by descending influences from the brain. It is now known that some kinds of pain can be diminished or abolished by anesthetic blocks of trigger points or by intense stimulation of the same points. These effects appear to be mediated by brainstem mechanisms that exert a tonic inhibitory effect on pain signals. Studies of paraplegic patients further elucidate the multiple neural interactions that occur in eliciting and alleviating pain. An example of interacting therapies for cancer pain is the significant augmentation of the effectiveness of the Brompton mixture by a psychologically supportive hospital environment.",

İnsan yaşamının üçte birini kapsayan bu karmaşık fizyolojik süreç, dolaşım, solunum, kas-iskelet ve merkezi sinir sistemi birçok sistemin sağlıklı bir şekilde işlemesinde önemli bir role sahiptir. Bireylerin sağlığını etkilediği gibi yaşam kalitelerini de etkileyen önemli bir olaydır. Uyku kalitesi ise bireylerin kendilerini zihinsel ve bedensel olarak iyi hissetmesidir. Uyku kalitesi kronik hastalık varlığı, stres, yaşam stili, çevresel faktörler, ekonomik durum, iş ve sosyal yaşam gibi birçok faktörden etkilenmektedir. Özellikle psikolojik stres ve uyku sorunları birbirleriyle çift yönlü bir ilişkiye sahiptir. Stres faktörleri uyku kalitesini etkilerken, uyku kalitesinin düşük olması da psikolojik semptomları kötüleştirebilir. İnfertilite tanı ve tedavi sürecinde uyku sorunlarının meydana geldiği yapılan çalışmalar ile gösterilmiştir. Bu sürecin getirdiği psikolojik sıkıntılar ve stres nedeniyle uyku süresinde kısalma, uyku verimliliğinde azalma ve uykunun sık sık bölünmesi gibi sorunlar meydana gelmektedir.

Disturbances in these areas of functioning are extremely common and may be caused by psychological and/or physical disturbances. Many other areas of fundamental biological functioning can be influenced psychologically, including disturbances in urination, temperature sense, heart rate, defecation, thirst, or sweating. Fever is always medical in etiology, unless it is documented to be factitious. Urinary or fecal incontinence in an adult should be considered to have a physical basis under all circumstances. When vegetative symptoms in the areas of sleep, sex, eating, and/or energy level persist for some time and no medical disorder is apparent, patients and clinicians often assume that the cause is emotional.",

      "title": "A Comparative Study Between Combinations of Ultrasound Therapy with Active Chin Tucking Exercise and Ultrasound Therapy with Sub Occipital Muscle Release in the Management of Non-Specific Neck Pain Due to Sub Occipital Muscle Tightness among Computer Professionals.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :\r\nNeck pain (or cervicalgia) is a common problem, with sixty percent of the\r\npopulation suffering with it at some point in their lives. Neck pain, although felt in the\r\nneck, can be caused by many other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to\r\nmuscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, and pinching of the nerves\r\nemanating from the cervical spine. Non-Specific Neck Pain is the most common one.\r\nThis is also known as 'simple' or “Mechanical' neck pain. The causes may be minor\r\nstrains and sprains to muscles or ligaments in the neck. Bad posture seems to be the\r\nmajor contributing factor in many cases. Neck pain can be caused due to many other\r\nphysical and emotional health problems as well.\r\nNeck pain is more common in people who spend most of their day working at\r\na desk, in front of the computer with a 'bent-forward' posture or ‘forward head\r\ncarriage’ posture. Non-Specific Neck Pain is most often caused by continuous\r\nforward head carrying posture leading to sub-occipital muscle tightness, decreased\r\ncervical mobility and obliterated cervical spine curvature. Forward head posture is\r\ncommonly adopted by visual display terminal [VDT] workers involving a\r\ncombination of lower cervical flexion and upper cervical extension. The important\r\ncauses of forward head posture are improperly placed computer screen, looking down\r\nwhile typing or reading, sitting improperly with shoulders rounded and back hunched,\r\nslouched postures or end result of faulty pelvic and lumbar spine posture.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY :\r\nTo determine the efficacy of physiotherapeutic techniques in the treatment of\r\nNon-Specific Neck Pain due to Sub-occipital muscle tightness among\r\ncomputer professionals.\r\nTo systematically compare the efficacy of Active Chin Tucking Exercises and\r\nsub occipital muscle release in the treatment of Non-Specific Neck Pain due to\r\nSub-occipital muscle tightness among computer professionals.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\n It is concluded that there is reduction of pain among computer professionals\r\ntreated with Ultrasound Therapy and Active Chin Tucking Exercise for their\r\nneck pain. It is concluded that there is improvement in Neck function among computer\r\nprofessionals with neck pain treated with Ultrasound Therapy and Active Chin\r\nTucking Exercise. It is concluded that there is reduction of pain among computer professionals\r\ntreated with Ultrasound Therapy and Sub Occipital Muscle Release Technique\r\nfor their neck pain. It is concluded that there is improvement also in Neck function among\r\ncomputer professionals with neck pain treated with Ultrasound Therapy and\r\nSub Occipital Muscle Release Technique. It is concluded that combination of Ultrasound Therapy with Active Chin Tucking Exercise training group showed statistically significant improvement\r\nin neck function than the other group. It is concluded that Ultrasound Therapy with Sub Occipital Muscle Release Technique training group showed statistically significant reduction in pain\r\nthan the other group.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

Further, psychosocial problems often are addressed only superficially or not at all during office visits.

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

Careful history, collateral examination and continual exploration were done for accurate diagnosis and proper management. Due to overlapping symptoms, the initial diagnosis of psychotic depression was revised to paranoid schizophrenia. Eventually, the detailed examination, neurological and laboratory work up were done and the treatment approach was adjusted. The diagnostic dilemma appeared during the initial stage of the late onset psychosis due to affective symptoms.

Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

This emotional state is characterized by feelings of sadness, sorrow, inactivity, and represents the universal and increasingly frequent life experience of modern man. Life events (changes) and influential social factors can be a trigger for depression. Causes can also be biological or genetic. Depression affects all age groups, but not everyone in the same way, with the same intensity or persistence. Also, each group has different causes with regard to age and life experience. It was generally thought that depression was a disease that affected only adults, but it turned out that it was not. It is more difficult to diagnose it at preschool and school age, but in adolescence it is easier because it is a period of the most turbulent change and the symptoms are more visible. One of the dangers of this disorder is that it can lead to suicide. Suicide is not a disorder in itself, but one of the possible outcomes of severe depression.Young people should be taught first and foremost for self-help and self-protection, as well as helped to preserve and promote mental and physical health. They should be objectively informed of all the harmful consequences that may arise as a product of reckless thinking, ideas and behavior. Depression affects the life of an individual by disturbing relationships with close people and can lead to the use of addictive agents. It is treated with different types of psychotherapy and / or pharmacological agents. The combination of all treatments has proven to be the most effective. Psychological educational work with teachers on this disorder has also shown to be effective. It is certainly needed in order for the teacher to recognize the symptoms and to support the child in crisis situations.",

Causes can be a primary neurologic insult or a result of a systemic illness resulting in end-organ dysfunction of the brain. Acute changes in mental status are more likely than chronic changes to be immediately life-threatening and are therefore the focus of this review. Given the potential time-sensitive nature, acute changes in mental status must be addressed immediately and with urgency. We recommend a primary survey followed by a secondary survey with special attention to immediate life-threatening reversible causes. We then recommend a systems-based approach searching for any other life-threatening or reversible causes. Because the differential for altered mental status is broad, a comprehensive emergency department evaluation including a detailed history and physical exam as well as laboratory and radiographic testing is needed.",

Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute disease carries a high level of stress for families, as the disease is of sudden onset and is life-threatening. The incidence of PTSD (21%) was significant among parents well after their child was discharged from the PICU. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the traumatic event through recurrent, intrusive recollections, repetitive play, or distressing dreams; avoidance of associations with the event through restricted affect and feelings of detachment; and hyperarousal symptoms such as sleep difficulties, poor concentration, irritability, aggression, and physiological reactivity to trauma-related events. In addition to general hyperarousal symptoms, children may complain of stomachaches and headaches. There have been many summaries and reviews of research published regarding the effects of hospitalization with these children. Findings indicate that the experience is, indeed, stressful and that children may experience fear phenomena, regression, sadness, separation anxiety, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behaviors. There was a positive correlation between PTSD symptoms in parents and PTSD symptoms in the child, length of admission and perceived threat of illness to the child’s life. In PICU admissions cause greater disruption to a child’s life, with longer admissions, greater time off school and more paediatric out-patient contacts and hospital re-admissions in the 6–12 months after discharge.",

In this paper, I describe common psychiatric conditions that often feature pain as part of the illness: somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, factitious physical disorders, pain associated with psychological factors (new DSM-IV nomenclature), and malingering. These conditions can be distinguished based on the conscious awareness (or lack of awareness) of both motivation and symptom production. Other psychiatric disorders may strongly influence chronic pain without directly causing it-depression, anxiety, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Except for malingering and factitious pain, chronic pain should be regarded as genuine.

Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. The term dysfunction is not clearly defined and is suggested not used. The prevalence of neuropathic pain is unknown, but a few detailed studies show that neuropathic pain is more common than previously assumed. Some common causes of neuropathic pain are entrapment/injuries to peripheral nerves, painful neuropathies, infections in the nervous system (i.e. postherpetic neuralgia), spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarcts. Evaluation of neuropathic pain is performed on the basis of a thorough clinical examination which includes detailed questioning of different types of pain. Both spontaneous (ongoing and paroxysmal) as well as evoked pain may occur. The ongoing pain may be described by a large number of adjectives such as burning, aching, throbbing, sore, cutting, but there is no pain descriptor which is diagnostic for neuropathic pain. Pain may usually be evoked by lightly touching the skin or by exposure to cold. A clinical neurological examination is necessary in the evaluation of the level of injury, possibly also electromyography/neurography in case of peripheral nerve lesions or CT/MR in case of central lesions. Neuropathic pain is almost always characterised by changes in sensibility, usually involving the thin-fibre system (peripheral nerve fibres or central projections). Special emphasis is put on the examination of sensory dysfunction.",

Вони можуть негативно вплинути на перебіг наявних у нього захворювань, у тому числі захворювань пародонта. Характер реакції на стресовий фактор значною мірою залежить від особистісного фактора.

The neurosurgical operating room (OR) is a challenging workplace where the team typically cares for critically ill patients who are hemodynamically and neurologically unstable. In a neurosurgical operating room, where the surgeon works on the brain and different arteries and nerves nearby, operating room hours are also lengthy. The neuro-anesthesiologist is often alert and prepared to handle any emergency, which is unsettling and draining. Burnout can result from the delivery of critical care because it causes physical, psychological, and emotional weariness in the healthcare professional.",

      "abstract": "Pudendal nerve entrapment (Alcock canal syndrome) is an uncommon source of chronic pelvic pain, in which the pudendal nerve is entrapped or compressed. Pain is located in the perineal, genital and perianal areas and is worsened by sitting. By simple entrapment of the PN without neurogenic damages, pain is usually isolated. In neurogenic damages to the PN, genito-anal numbness, fecal and/or urinary incontinence can occurred. PNE can be caused by obstetric traumas, scarring due to genitoanal surgeries (prolaps procedures!), accidents and surgical mishaps. Diagnosis is based on anamnesis, clinical examination including vaginal or rectal palpation of the pelvic nerves with selective nerve blockade. Pudendal pain non systematic mean PNE since other neuropathies may induce pudendal pain. So sacral radiculopathies (sacral nerves roots S#2-4) are underestimated etiologies frequently responsible for pudendal pain with irradiation in sacral dermatomes, bladder hypersensitivity or in neurogenic lesions, bladder retention.",

Tension headache includes headaches in which the psychic element may be associated with muscular, articular or other causes. Subjects with this type of headache feel as though their skull was compressed by a tight helmet and was heavy, or as though the back of their neck and the occipital region were under tension. The condition is chronic and often lasts for long periods. Psychological and psychopathological analysis discloses the genesis of this tension headache which may simply be a response to a more or less repetitive stress or to anxiety and/or depression, but may also be the somatic expression of a neurotic state with a more consistent structure. This analysis leads to a treatment which includes psychotropic drugs, but where the relational component remains fundamental in the management of these patients.",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

Elle represente aussi un facteur important de cout en matiere de depense de sante. En effet, les patients deprimes sont plus souvent hospitalises et recourent plus souvent aux services medicaux que les autres, sans toutefois etre mieux traites pour leur depression. Tous les auteurs insistent sur la necessite d’ameliorer son diagnostic afin de proposer une prise en charge adaptee. Une des causes du sous‐diagnostic actuel tient moins a la specificite de la depression du sujet âge qu’a l’attitude des cliniciens face au vieillissement. Si les differents guidelines recents insistent tous sur le caractere independant de l’âge des criteres diagnostiques de la depression, sa presentation chez le sujet âge et des facteurs propres au vieillissement interferent avec sa reconnaissance. Parmi ces facteurs, il faut souligner l’importance des plaintes somatiques, des troubles cognitifs et des troubles anxieux. Enfin, si la depression ne fait pas partie du processus normal de vieillissement, vieillir s’accompagne de situations favorisant sa survenue comme, en particulier, le deuil. La distinction entre ce qui releve du deuil et ce qui est de l’ordre d’une depression necessite une approche clinique rigoureuse.",

The strangeness of its psychiatric manifestations, particularly the thought distortion and the flatness or inappropriateness of affect, seems to set them apart from common experience. Yet, like the affective syndromes, schizophrenia merges with the normal condition and with other psychiatric states. As in depression and mania, the seat of dysfunction is probably the limbic system and involves many brain systems. The aetiology is probably multiple, but in spite of a plethora of theories, the cellular mechanism remains obscure. However, there is growing evidence that schizophrenia is an organic psychosis associated with structural pathology in the brain.",

These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep).

Most investigations concerning \"head injury\" are really about brain injury. In some reports, however, it is unclear whether the authors intended to study brain injury or head injury. Determining brain injury severity has been a long-standing problem. For decades, various systems were employed, and most were nonreproducible because of their subjective nature. Duration of unconsciousness was one of the most consistently used criteria to judge severity, because it was positively correlated with diffuse brain damage. A spinal cord injury that results in loss of motor or sensory function is one of the most catastrophic medical conditions recognized.",

Moreover, chronic pain can be an accompanying symptom of largely irreversible underlying disease, such as degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis), spinal stenosis, or compression fracture resulting from osteoporosis in older people. Chronic pain can also be a primary complaint of clinical conditions such as fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia, for which neither the aetiology nor mechanism is currently well understood.\n\nChronic pain is therefore not simply a chronological extension of acute pain and requires different diagnostic approaches and management strategies.

Different forms of visual delusions have typical clinical characteristics, which presumably account for different pathophysiological correlates. All forms of visual perseveration occur paroxysmally, if they are the result of a brain lesion, and are usually unilateral and then contralateral to the lesion. Various casuistic data reveals how different the pathogenesis of visual palinopsia can be: epilepsy, intracranial tumor, cerebral infarction, migraine, traumatic brain injury and so on. Polyopia presents special type of visual perseveration. Photopsias, also called phosphenes or photomes, appear in different diseases. Before a neurological disorder is taken into consideration, diseases of the eye or intoxication and side effects of medicine should be excluded. The pathogenesis of the hallucinations is diverse; the visual hallucinations in epilepsy are most frequently the result of traumatic brain injury, cerebral hemorrhage or, occasionally, cerebral ischemia or tumor.",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

Historical clues and examination features play a major role in diagnosing these disorders, but diagnosis can be challenging due to phenotypic overlap. Ancillary testing, such as neuroimaging or laboratory testing, is driven by the history and examination, and should be performed particularly when there are other neurological or systemic manifestations. The pathophysiology of tremor is not entirely understood, but likely involves multiple networks along with the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. Treatment options include medications, botulinum toxin, surgery, and nonpharmacologic interventions utilizing physical and occupational therapies and assistive devices.

On the contrary, in the latter case, it does not offer elements for any etiopathogenic hypothesis because it happens in almost all cases with an acute onset in an otherwise healthy subject and it is always underestimated because of the minor functional impairment. However, clinical studies in the last years led to a significant evolution of otological findings as an early important symptom in the etiopathogenic study and in the diagnosis of some internal diseases. This is true for connectivitis, in which the disease is often preceded by a sudden cochleovestibular symptom, in some dismetabolic or vascular diseases that sometimes begin with fluctuating hearing loss, or in some cochlear manifestations due to ototoxic origin.",

      "title": "CURRENT TRENDS IN MILITARY NEUROPSYCHIATRY",
      "abstract": "In pursuing these policies of prevention and treatment, many difficulties remain. Perhaps the most outstanding is the widespread misconception regarding the whole subject of mental health in the mind not only of military personnel but of the civilian public, the family back home, and the public press. It is generally recognized that the concept of physical health covers a wide range of conditions ranging from a light head cold on down to terminal lobar pneumonia. Mental health, on the other hand, has been regarded as being black or white. Either a man was insane or he was completely normal. The possibility has not been considered that there might be anything in between. Actually, of course, mental health just as physical health ranges all the way from bad to good. A man may have minor temporary mental ill health just as he may have a head cold. Mental disorders may be acute or chronic, severe or mild; just as a man may have simultaneously a broken leg and the grippe he may have an acute anxiety neurosis superimposed on a psychopathic personality or an organic condition. A great deal of the confusion has arisen on the basis of terminology and semantics. Any word beginning with the letters \"psy,\" to the average mind, suggests something mysterious and alarming: insanity, perversion, homicidal tendencies. Many laymen become frightened and resentful when a psychiatrist applies a medical term to conditions they were used to recognizing as a \"case of the jitters\" or \"gone stale\" or \"nervousness.\" It is difficult for laymen to realize that when a case of the jitters is sufficiently serious to incapacitate a man or produce insomnia and indigestion, a psychiatrist may call it pstchoneurosis and yet not mean anything more serious than was meant by the layman who called it the jitters. Actually, of course, the problem extends further than this. The question arises whether present psychiatric terminology was designed to cover the entire range of mental health. Is it perhaps necessary to devise a new set of diagnostic terms to cover the range of acute transitory psychiatric disturbances which occur in \"normal\" individuals in reaction to abnormal stress? In conclusion, it may be said that the problems of mental health in this war have presented a major challenge to psychiatrists. To meet this challenge it was necessary to revise concepts and to approach problems with new viewpoints—it was necessary to shift attention from problems of the abnormal mind in normal times to problems of the normal mind in abnormal times.",

Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae.

Zaburzenia podobne do psychotycznych bywają traktowane jako element poszerzonego fenotypu psychozy – według niektórych badań czynniki ryzyka występowania PLE są zbliżone do czynników ryzyka rozwoju schizofrenii. Inne prace sugerują, że występowanie PLE jest związane z ryzykiem występowania innych objawów psychopatologicznych, między innymi objawów depresyjnych, tendencji suicydalnych i nieprawidłowego funkcjonowania w różnych obszarach. Niewykluczone, że PLE są związane z ryzykiem rozwoju psychozy, dotyczy to jednak niewielkiego odsetka osób badanych; wydaje się natomiast, że występowanie PLE jest również czynnikiem ryzyka rozwoju innych zaburzeń psychicznych. U większości dzieci i adolescentów doświadczających PLE doznania te ustępują w toku obserwacji. PLE prawdopodobnie są zjawiskiem heterogennym, obejmującym zarówno podtyp związany z ryzykiem rozwoju psychozy, objawy wynikające z innym zaburzeń psychicznych jak i doznania mieszczące się w obszarze normy. Brak powszechnie akceptowanej definicji PLE oraz duża różnorodność metodologii badawczej utrudniają jednoznaczną interpretację dotychczasowych badań.",

The clinical symptoms of these disturbances are as follows: The blood pressure becomes higher on a constant level, and at the same time one finds various signs of cardiac incompetence, especially during physical work, such as increase in the pulse rate, precordial uneasiness and, sometimes, dizziness. The accommodative power of the blood pressure becomes unsteady, as demonstrated by its irregular fluctuation. Therefore, an investigation into the complicated mechanism of the origin of high blood pressure in persons of presenile age is justified. The problem is important, since it is connected with many interesting questions of disease in human beings. The consideration of these questions may also bring",

      "abstract": "In addition to accidental crisis, we are often talking in the modern world about development crisis. The terms like period, or time, even years of crisis are mostly used in the milieu of our country, because our people were exposed to contemporary or successive critical situations. This increases the general tendency to mental disorders and causes many pathological phenomena, with suicide among them as the most serious. In our society suicide is treated as well as a product of illness or seismograph of sociable impact, because there is high unemployment, privation, high percent of divorce and social isolation. Nevertheless, the same occurs in other developmental states, were benefit of civilization, wrongly directed, can dehumanize and alienate and lead to suicidal tendencies. Although, the risk of suicide is 3-12 times higher among psychiatric patients, the greatest number of those who commit suicide have never met a psychiatrist. Furthermore, when in the presence of mental illness, the patient consciously chooses death, great stigma and mystery remains attached to the psychiatrist himself. Psychiatrists are sometimes placed between, on the one side, some statistical reports or simplified approaches, which very clearly claim to know the causes of and, on the other side, knowledge about the role of the unconscious in in formulation of not why someone committed suicide, butwhat does he wanted to reach? Psychiatric experience is that there will be 5 patient's suicides within a psychiatrist's life span. We are afraid this figure will be exceeded today, in a time of crisis, endangering the psychiatrist himself. The Psychiatrist should not stay alone in his treatment of suicidal patient. He needs a great support of society, just like his patient does. Only by working together, will we feel that we are doing something not with, but for someone who wants to commit suicide.

Clinical correlates of post-stroke depression include severity of physical and cognitive impairment as well as location of brain injury. Perhaps the most compelling reason to identify post-stroke depression, however, is its substantial impact on recovery in activities of daily living, cognitive function, and survival. Antidepressant medication has been shown to effectively treat depression, although its administration may require careful clinical monitoring. Other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders include mania, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, apathy, and pathological crying. Controlled studies have not documented the effect of these disorders on long-term recovery, but the potential impact of syndromes such as mania and apathy on rehabilitation efforts or pathological crying on social functioning are evident. With the exception of pathological crying, which has been shown to respond to antidepressant drug therapy, the other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders need to be evaluated in controlled treatment trials for response to therapy.",

      "abstract": "FATIGUE is one of the most interesting topics of conversation among physicians and nurses but, as is so true of many medical expressions, the exact meaning of the word is vague and indefinite. There are, of course, a great many ways of defining it. Fatigue should mean not the impairment of one's ability to function which comes after unusual or prolonged physical exertion, but rather the total inability to manifest interest, enthusiasm, concentration, and so on that is so commonly seen after prolonged combinations of physical and emotional distress. Physicians see patients with this problem of fatigue much more commonly than most people realize. It is not unusual for a physician to find that at least two out of every three of his office patients have it. Admittedly, a patient does not always say, Doctor, I am coming to you because I am fatigued. More often the diagnosis is arrived at only after laborious and extensive examinations involving many types of tests. Examinations of this kind, which have been carried on at the University of Oregon Medical School by the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Chemistry together, have revealed some very interesting things about the fatigue syndrome. The results of these experiments and our own observations make us feel that we are a little closer to truly understanding what the subject of fatigue covers.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

This is particularly true in my particular area of interest, irritable bowel syndrome, where patients′ symptoms are often not at all explained or only somewhat explained. This has sparked a research interest in medically unexplained recurrent abdominal pain in young adults. Contrary to lay opinion, physical symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain are found to be unexplained by disease, even after extensive medical assessment. There is now increasing evidence that medically unexplained physical symptoms are a major cause of disability and place a very substantial burden on both the NHS and the economy in general. Recurrent abdominal pain affects between 10−15% of school children in the UK. In many cases, the underlying cause of the abdominal pain is unexplained. Stress and anxiety are commonly associated with this condition which has been termed ‵abdominal migraine′. These medically unexplained physical symptoms are sometimes linked to somatoform disorders or psychosomatic disorders.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

A sua presenca condiciona maiores dificuldades na avaliacao da dor, de outros sintomas ou problemas, - a obstipacao, a retencao urinaria, febre, a infeccao respiratoria ou urinaria, desidratacao, etc., - pela perturbacao que causa na comunicacao com o doente e por impedir uma participacao nas decisoes que dizem respeito a sua doenca. Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

Primary headaches have no identifiable underlying cause whilst secondary headaches have an underlying pathology. Delirium is a more specific term for an acute episode of fluctuating altered mental status. Altered mental status may herald the onset of a life-threatening or of a reversible condition. Symptoms of weakness include difficulty with activity of daily livings or problems with gait and loss of balance.

Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

      "abstract": "Painful conditions are probably among the most frequent reasons for seeking medical advice and assistance. Although pain is a common complaint among psychiatric patients, clinicians generally separate its presence from the background mental disorder and downplay its importance, trying primarily to control the psychiatric symptomatology. As a sensory modality, the presence of pain and its importance account for an impressive body of scholarly research. Cartesian methodology considered sensations of all modalities in a mechanistic form, which actually sounds obsolete. However, authors have continuously been faced with the same dilemmas plaguing scholars for centuries. We assume that a large portion of the sensory inputs might be generators of distorted perceptions, which subsequently lead to psychopathology. Auditory and visual hallucinations are incontestable examples. Somaesthetic hallucinations also exist, but pain hardly deserves such a denomination. Nevertheless, chronic pain and psychiatric comorbidity is a reality that needs explanation. Painkillers are not effective in treating psychiatric disorders, and antipsychotics do very little, perhaps nothing, to relieve pain. The pharmacological approach opens one door on the horizon and closes many others, while clinicians continue to face a high prevalence of comorbid pain and mental health issues. However, attempts to correlate altered body schemata (as distorted as it may be, for example, in phantom limb pain) with somatic delusions can simplify all these dilemmas, and the basket of psychophysiology, in fact, might be bigger than presumed.",

Individual in a stressful situation is influenced by his or her mental ability to carry out ongoing tasks. Medical education is highly challenging and often places heavy demands on the mental health of the students. Compared to other fields of education; medical education is evidenced by high prevalence of stress. Educational process exerts an inadvertent negative effect on student’s mental health with a high frequency of depression, anxiety and stress among medical students. Students exposed to work overload and examinations in a competitive environment with constant pressure of assessment brings various changes in their daily habits such as lack of sleep and irregular diet. Mental morbidity is least accounted form of all population health studies and with the threatening rates of mental ill-health and rising rates of deaths due to the lack of early recognition of these morbidities, with not many Indian studies to document this burden. Therefore, the presence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students was assessed using a previously validated and standardized instrument, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and the associations with their socio-demographic characteristics were identified. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students and to study the association of stress, anxiety and depression with the socio-demographic characteristics of medical under- graduate students.",

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

De nombreux facteurs de risque concourent a cet etat de fait, qu'ils soient d'ordre psychopathologique, biologique, iatrogenique ou sociologique. La specificite de l'âge avance est le risque de rechute, de chronicisation, de suicide, de perte d'autonomie et d'evolution dementielle. Cette pathologie est pourtant largement sous diagnostiquee et dementielle. Cette pathologie est pourtant largement sous diagnostiquee et sous traitee : les signes etant bonalises et faussement attribues a l'âge. Cela tient aussi a la frequence des formes masquees par des signes somatiques ou d'autres signes psychiatriques au premier plan. La depression peut a l'inverse masquer une pathologie somatique sous-jacente en particulier neurologique. Pour guider notre prescription, nous ne disposons que de peu d'etudes validees dans cette population. Force est de nous referer aux travaux de consensus. Si tous les antidepreseurs apparaissent comparables en terme d'efficacite, mieux vaut privilegier en premiere intention ceux qui offrent le meilleur rapport tolerance/efficacite compte tenu de l'importance des effets lateraux chez la personne âgee et se fier a une approche dimensionnelle. Ainsi, si les ISRS sont indiques en premier lieu, le moclobemide a sa place notamment en cas de depression avec ralentissement et inhibition. Le traitement antidepresseur dont l'effet est retarde chez la personne âgee doit etre poursuivi de 6 mois a 1 an lors d'un premier episode. L'ECT est indique en cas de depression delirante, melancolique ou mettant en jeu le pronostic vital. Les thymoregulateurs ou le traitement antidepresseur au long cours se discutent en cas de recurrence des le deuxieme episode. L'abord psychotherapeurtique et psychosocial ne doit pas etre neglige car les facteurs d'entretient de la depression, somatiques, ou socio-affectifs perdurent et augmentent avec l'âge et l'eventualite de rechute est grande.",

      "title": "P288 Somatic complaints in anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Conclusions of current state of the art report that 50% of all children and adolescents outpatient visits to a paediatrician are determined by a physical/somatic complaint. After medical evaluation, a third of these complaints have no apparent organic cause, thereby becoming a medically unexplained symptom. Somatic complaints have become a topic of research in child and adolescent psychiatric literature, as these are often correlated with anxiety disorders in this age category. Separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder or scholar phobia (scholar refusal) for which physical symptoms are a part of the <i>DSM</i> diagnostic criteria are associated with increased somatic complaints. The term school phobia was first used in 1941 to identify children who fail to attend school because attendance causes emotional distress and anxiety, but since the early 2000's the term school refusal is preferred. Children who refuse to attend school usually try to win a parent's permission to stay home, although some simply refuse to leave the house. In recent studies, the most commonly endorsed somatic symptoms in children and adolescent sample of school refusers were gastrointestinal items: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pains. Another physical symptoms are common and include dizziness, headaches, shaking or trembling, fast heart rate, chest pains, and back, joint pains. These symptoms usually improve once the child is allowed to stay home. Behavioural symptoms include temper tantrums, crying, angry outbursts, and threats to hurt themselves. Usually, for parents, somatic symptoms outweigh the concerns, fears, and child's refusal to attend the tests or going to school, so parents repeatedly address the family doctor or paediatrician. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This paper aims to emphasise the importance of completing medical history and laboratory investigations with data that may suggest a psychogenic cause of somatic complaints. After excluding organic causes, it is important for paediatric patients to be oriented to mental health services for early intervention. This is important to delineate because the longer is the period of missing school the harder it is the educational reintegration. The long term consequences are unfavourable for the child including loss of peer relationships and academic difficulties.",

The goal of this chapter is to familiarize the practitioner with some of the more common syndromes and treatments, providing knowledge to fuel appropriate clinical decision-making when treating patients with psychogenic challenges. Pre-existing anxiety disorders by themselves, or aggravated by impending dental treatment, may be the reason for the administration of office-based sedation/anesthesia. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder. As with most psychiatric illness, treatment of depression often extends beyond medication. Antipsychotic medication should be started early to avoid social or physical harm often associated with more severe psychotic episodes. Macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals are medications often used by the dental profession. It is impossible to predict dose requirements for patients who abuse drugs.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Latar Belakang: Penyakit Jantung Koroner (PJK) / Coronnary Artery Disease (CAD) merupakan salah satu penyakit jantung yang sangat penting karena penyakit ini diderita oleh jutaan orang dan merupakan penyebab kematian utama di beberapa negara termasuk Indonesia. Banyak di antara penderita yang semula (sebelum menderita penyakit jantung) kondisi mental-emosionalnya stabil, kemudian menjadi terganggu manakala yang bersangkutan ternyata diketahui terdapat kelainan pada organ jantungnya. Penanganan terhadap penyakit ini juga perlu dilaksanakan sejak awal kejadian mengingat tanda dan gejala yang sering tersembunyi atau sebaliknya, jika tampak signifikan berpotensi mengganggu aktifitas harian pasien. Dampak lanjut bila pasien dengan PJK tidak segera mengambil keputusan yang tepat maka tidak menutup kemungkinan individu akan jatuh pada keadaan kegawatdaruratan bahkan kematian. Krisis pada individu dan hospitalisasi dapat mengakibatkan stress pada individu itu sendiri dan keluarganya. Selama menjalani proses perawatan dan terapi, individu dan keluarga dapat mengalami berbagai kejadian yang sangat traumatik dan penuh dengan strees. Berbagai respon psikologik dapat terjadi dan yang sering muncul menurut pengalaman pasien yang medapatkan perawatan adalah perasaan cemas, bingung dan gelisah. Kecemasan dicetuskan oleh sesuatu yang tidak diketahui dan muncul sebelum ada pengalaman baru, yang mengancam identitas dan harga diri seseorang. Tujuan: Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memperoleh gambaran persepsi yang mendalam tentang pengalaman pasien dengan PJK yang dirawat di ICVCU RSUD Dr. Doris Sylvanus Palangka Raya.  Metode: Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan wawancara mendalam pada delapan orang partisipan yang di rawat di ICVCU RSUD Dr. Doris Sylvanus Palangka Raya. Analisis data yang digunakan menggunakan teknik Collaizi. Hasil: Terdapat tujuh tema yang teridentifikasi dalam penelitian ini yaitu respon berduka; respon menerima diagnosis PJK; dampak penyakit pada aspek fisik; psikososial; spiritual; kebutuhan akan pelayanan kesehatan; dukungan moral. Simpulan: Berdasarkan hasil penelitian tersebut diharapkan perawat menjalankan peran dan fungsinya dengan baik dalam melaksanakan asuhan keperawatan profesional. Kata Kunci: Pengalaman pasien, PJK, Mendapatkan perawatan ABSTRACK Background: Coronnary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the most important heart diseases because this disease affects millions of people and is the leading cause of death in several countries including Indonesia. Many of the patients who were originally (before suffering from heart disease) had a stable mental-emotional condition, then became disturbed when they were found to have abnormalities in their heart organs. Handling of this disease also needs to be carried out from the beginning of the incident considering the signs and symptoms that are often hidden or vice versa, if it appears to have significant potential to interfere with the patient's daily activities. Further impact if the patient with CHD does not immediately make the right decision, it is not possible for the individual to fall into an emergency and even death. Crisis in individuals and hospitalization can cause stress on the individual himself and his family. During the process of treatment and therapy, individuals and families can experience a variety of events that are very traumatic and full of stress. Various psychological responses can occur and what often arises according to the experience of patients who get treatment is a feeling of anxiety, confusion and anxiety. Anxiety is triggered by something unknown and emerging before there is a new experience, which threatens a person's identity and self-esteem. Objective : This study aims to obtain an overview of the deep perception of the experience of patients with CHD who were treated at ICVCU Hospital Dr. Doris Sylvanus Palangka Raya. Method : Data collection was conducted by in-depth interviews with eight participants who were treated at ICVCU Dr. Doris Sylvanus Palangka Raya.

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

      "abstract": "The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD.

      "abstract": "By dictionary definition, an emergency is any sudden state of affairs which demands immediate action. In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and related disorders are the most common type of mental disorders in both the general population and the neurological clinic. A current typology of anxiety disorders includes panic disorder, agoraphobia, simple (specific) phobias, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders often accompany diseases of the nervous system, worsen their course and impede treatment, and the degree of anxiety usually corresponds to the severity of neurological symptoms. Anxiety may precede brain diseases, but the answer to the question of whether it contributes to these diseases or predicts them or can be an early manifestation of these diseases requires further studies. Modern approaches to the treatment of anxiety involve the use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, some mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, as well as psychological interventions.Тревога и связанные с ней расстройства представляют наиболее распространенный тип психических нарушений как в общей популяции, так и в неврологической клинике. Современная систематика тревожных расстройств включает паническое расстройство, агорафобию, простые (специфические) фобии, социальное тревожное расстройство и генерализованное тревожное расстройство. Тревожные расстройства часто сопутствуют болезням нервной системы, ухудшают их течение и затрудняют лечение, выраженность тревоги обычно соответствует тяжести неврологических симптомов. Тревога нередко предшествует болезням мозга, но ответ на вопросы о том, способствует ли она этим болезням, является их предиктором или ранним проявлением, требует дополнительных исследований. Современные подходы к лечению тревоги предполагают применение бензодиазепинов, антидепрессантов, отдельных нормотимиков, антипсихотиков, а также использование психотерапии.",

It can be an isolated symptom or a symptom of another neurological disorder, such as dystonia, Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia et al. It is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. It can affect the hands, arms, head, vocal cord, jaw, chin, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. Clinically, the most useful way to categorized tremor is whether it occurs mainly at rest, on postural, or during movement (kinetic tremor). Tremor is most common classified by different clinical features and cause or origin; include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, physiologic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Diagnosis need a detail history (include familial inheritance, drugs exposure, alcohol consumption or withdraw); complete physical examination and laboratory tests. Electromyography is also a simple and quick method with which to calculate tremor frequency and amplitude for assisting diagnosis. Treatment for majority of tremor syndrome is purely symptomatic, and is similar regardless of the underlying cause of the tremor. There are different medicines to try in order propranolol, clonazepam, primidome and gabapentin for limb tremors, or trihexyphenidyl for dystonic tremor. Focal botulinum toxin injection may be help in focal tremor. Neurosurgery is only indicated in severe tremor, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus for primary or secondary parkinsonian tremor.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of stress is complicated and it contains many different definitions.The first studies on stress have been based on physiology, but in the middle of the last century many psychological models emerged.Stress reaction can occur not only as a response to a real psychological and physical events, but also in their expectation.This type of stress is called the \"psychological\" and it is considered as the most important in today's society as the main cause of chronic stress.Professional, work or stress related to the profession, has a relatively short history in the scientific discussion.Certain theories emphasize people and the environment interact.In recent years, the pressure on physicians has increased in many countries, as a result of various health care reform affecting the autonomy of doctors, prestige and income, leading to more stress at work.Work stress can lead to chronic reactions, such as poor health, burnout and depression.The objective of this study was to investigate and determine the level of job stress for emergency medicine physicians and psychiatrists, as well as factors affecting its emergence, development and manifestation (in the actual medical literature called \"burnout syndrome\", i.e. \"burnout\").The study was designed as a cross sectional study.Respondents were emergency medicine physicians and psychiatrists (the average number of working hours at all was more than 35 per week), and 330 questionnaires were distributed.The total number of completed tests was 302 (152 emergency medicine physicians and 150 psychiatrists), which gives a very high response rate of 91.8%.The research was conducted through a questionnaire, which consisted of six segments, namely: socio-demographic questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire -GHQ, Maslach Burnout Inventory -MBI, Quality of Life -QOL, Questionnaire of employee satisfaction (UZZ) and emotions profile index -PIE.The level of burnout (MBI) was higher in all three domains, than in similar studies in the world literature, as well as level of psychological distress (GHQ), and the same scores were also higher than those in well-known, so far published and / or implemented in the papers in our country.Quality of life (QOL), and job satisfaction of employees (UZZ) in this sample, were significantly correlated with the above findings, i.e. burnout and psychological distress.The findings of certain characteristics of the emotional profile of the respondents (PIE), was also complement, and it showed the influence and importance of internal factors on the overall perception of job stress.Marriage, age, gender and habits, as sociodemographic characteristics, were statistically significantly associated with these factors.The general conclusion is that the level of job stress in emergency physicians and psychiatrists in this study was high, and as the factors that influence and contribute to the origin, maintenance and consequences, level of burnout, psychological distress, quality of life, job satisfaction among employees, emotional profile and sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents were proven.The presented results could contribute in the formulation of an additional guidance for the research and struggle against job stress, and all in order to protect the mental health of doctors who are entrepreneurs in a highly specific and human profession, and to achieve a greater productivity and to provide higher quality of healthcare services for patients.",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

      "abstract": "Autonomic and somatic manifestations of anxiety are common in medically ill patients. When anxiety symptoms occur in such patients, the psychiatrist's ability to rapidly identify anxiety and perform a proper differential diagnosis is important, and can be life-saving. For example, a patient with deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary function may be misidentified as primarily \"anxious\" and referred to the psychiatrist. The change in the patient's medical status is missed until the situation becomes critical. Medication side effects can also cause anxiety symptoms in the medically ill patient. It is important for the psychiatrist to have knowledge of medications commonly associated with such side effects. Diagnosing primary anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, can be difficult in medically ill patients, but it is an important skill for the consulting psychiatrist. Anxiety can occur secondary to the stress or fear associated with illness, particularly serious illness. This presentation will discuss all of the aforementioned aspects of anxiety in the patient with concomitant medical illness.",

      "abstract": "Psychological stress might play a crucial role in infertility and miscarriage. Infertile women have greater vulnerability to psychological stressors, which may lead to major depressive disorder. Psychological stress acts as a trigger for anxiety and depression disorders. Acute or chronic stress could act as a risk factor and lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which causes changes in the neurotransmitter system and may be involved in the development of depression. Some studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines can be elevated during psychological stress. However, their reliability as a stress marker is still in query.",

      "title": "Poststroke Depression",
      "abstract": "AbstractNeuropsychological symptoms are probably among the most commonly ignored complications in stroke patients. Depression is a common yet often unrecognized neuropsychological consequence of stroke, having biological, psychobehavioral, and social dimensions. The reported prevalence of depression following a stroke varies from 20% to 50% within the first year, with an apparent peak within the first 6 months of onset event. The disparity of reported prevalence rates significantly depends on study methodology, diagnostic assessment tools, and time elapsed after stroke onset. The etiology of depression after a stroke is complex; it is likely determined by multiple factors, including lesion location, social handicap, and family support. Depression impedes rehabilitation progress following stroke and is associated with impaired functional outcome, cognitive decline, and increased mortality. Similarly, depression has been linked to increased risk of stroke occurrence. Despite high prevalence and serious sequels, poststroke depression (PSD) remains undetected and untreated. Early diagnosis and successful intervention may improve clinical outcome and should be considered a key for better stroke care. In this article, we review the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and consequences of PSD and summarize current recommendations for therapeutic intervention.Keywords: depressionoutcomestroke",

In the other group of cases, the cause is mental, because the patient’s present mental symptoms can be traced back to, and explained in terms of, one of his previous mental experiences, or a whole series of such experiences, which constituted his reactions to what happened to him in the past.",

      "abstract": "Background: Psychological stress is a reaction to an unexpected situation that favours adaptation and response to the event. However, when psychological stress is chronic or very intense, it can induce changes in various systems and tissues, causing diseases or aggravating existing ones. Objective: To briefly analyse the pathophysiological conditions caused by psychological stress. Method: A narrative review of the scientific literature on pathophysiological conditions as a consequence of psychological stress was performed. Results: Psychological stress can induce various conditions at the gastrointestinal, immune and cardiovascular levels. This is mainly due to the neurobiological and endocrine response because when faced with a stressful stimulus, a deregulated release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines is generated, altering the normal physiology of the organism. Gastrointestinal disorders are mainly due to goblet cell dysfunction, resulting in intestinal hyperpermeability, inflammation and infection. Changes at the immune level lead to an increase in inflammatory responses but a decrease in the protective activities of the immune system. Finally, cardiovascular conditions include atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure and stroke. Conclusion: Psychological stress can induce real physiological pathologies and, in some cases, fatal ones. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies have already been studied and identified. Knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can help clinicians and therapists to improve the treatment and therapy of patients.",

The focus is on using the person’s symptoms to both understand their presentation (making the diagnosis) and to engage them in treatment.

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "abstract": "병적 도벽은 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(이하 DSM), fourth edition에서는 ‘다른 곳에 분류 되지 않는 충동조절장애’에 속해 있었으나 DSM, fifth edition에서는 ‘파괴적, 충동-조절 및 품행장애 편’에 있으며, ‘개인적으로 쓸모가 없거나 금전적으로 가치가 없는 물건을 훔치려는 충동을 저지하는 데 반복적으로 실패하는 것’으로 정의한다. 대개의 경우 그 물건을 살 만한 돈을 갖고 있는 것 이 보통이며, 훔치는 행위와 함께 점차적인 긴장감에서 해방 이 되다가, 나중에 죄악감, 후회감 및 우울감을 동반하는 경우 와 그렇지 않은 경우가 있다. 도둑질한 물건 자체가 목표일 때에는 병적 도벽이 아니며, 도둑질하는 행위 그 자체가 1차 적 목표일 때에만 병적 도벽이라고 한다. 도벽은 화를 내거 나 복수를 위해 표현되지 않아야 하며 망상과 환청의 반응 으로 나타나지 않아야 하고 조증 삽화, 반 사회성 인격장애 와 같은 행동장애로 설명되지 않아야 한다. 유병률은 전체 인구의 0.6~0.8%일 것이라고 추정하고 있 으나 환자들이 자신의 행동에 대한 수치심으로 인해 누구에 게도 이야기하지 않고 혼자 비밀을 간직한다는 것과 체포되 어 법적으로 의뢰된 사람들의 통계라는 점에서 실제 유병률 은 훨씬 더 많을 것이라 추정된다. 흔히 여성의 경우가 2:1 정도로 많은 것으로 알려져 있으며, 원인으로는 정신 사회적 요인, 생물학적 요인 등이 있다. 병적 도벽의 치료로는 약물치료와 정신 치료적 접근법이 있다. 약물치료로는 충동조절장애에 사용되는 약물이 유력하 게 보고되고 있으며, 주로 병적 도벽에 동반되는 정신장애에 중점을 두었다. 8주간의 이중 맹검 대조군 시험 결과 Naltrexone이 위약에 비해 효과가 있음을 보여주는 연구가 있었 다. 하지만 단기간의 연구일 뿐 장기적으로 효과가 유지될지 여부에 대하여는 의문이 남는다. 정신 치료적 접근의 대다수는 증례 연구에 기반을 두고 있 으며 행동치료, 정신 분석적 정신 치료, 인지행동치료가 있 다. 인지행동치료는 병적 도벽에 효과가 있는 것으로 알려 져 있고, 체계적 탈감작(systematic desensitization), 혐오요법 (aversion therapy), 내재적 민감화(covert sensitization) 등 이 있다. 내재적 민감화 기법은 1960년대 중반 심리학자인 Joseph Cautela에 의해 개발되었으며, 알코올 중독, 흡연, 비 만, 소아성애 및 노출증과 같이 부정적인 결과를 초래하는 행동을 반복적으로 하는 사람들의 치료에 사용되었다. 병적 CASE REPORT",

In regard to the fact that these psychoorganic disorders often occur without the classical appearance of vegetative disorders which are typical for hypoglycemia, psychoorganic disorders therefore, present a great challenge and risk in differential diagnostics. The paper presents two types of confusion states which can occur in the course of hypoglycemia. They are the stiff, stuporous confusion state, as well as the anxious, agitated confusion state.",

      "title": "Can we distinguish anxiety from depression?",
      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that although anxiety and depression are separate syndromes and can be identified as such, there is considerable overlap of clinical symptoms and pathophysiological processes. Data indicate that comorbid anxiety and depression is more common than either disorder alone. A large US study found that 58% of individuals with a history of depression also had an anxiety disorder, and a study by the World Health Organization showed that anxiety and depression were the most common coexisting psychological problems in primary care. Generalized anxiety disorder in particular is strongly comorbid with, and commonly precedes, major depression. The implications of comorbid anxiety and depression are significant, with increased social and psychological impairment, and poorer clinical outcomes and prognosis. Anxiety and depression coexist at much higher rates than would be expected by chance alone, suggesting that the two disorders are closely related and may have a common cause. Disturbances of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are both implicated in anxiety and depression, and new evidence suggests that these systems may provide a mechanistic link between the two disorders, with changes in one system being reflected in the other. Abnormal homeostasis of these two systems may result in anxiety and depression. New theories hypothesize a continuum of illness, with anxiety and depression possibly being different phenotypic expressions of a common neurobiological origin. There is still uncertainty regarding the neurobiological cause, but it is probably linked to dysregulation in the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.",

In other words, a situation in which a number of workers in a particular plant or factory develop what appears to be some mysterious disease although there is no clearly identified micro‐organism. The specific symptoms seem to vary from one industrial situation to another but they all consist of subjective somatic complaints, such as headaches, nausea, sleepiness, chills, etc.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Jeongji(情志) in Chinese medicine refers to a series of psychological activity which is expressed as hui(喜), no(怒), wu(優), sa(思), bi(悲), gong(恐), gyeong(驚), together with emotion, sentiment, and cognition, which are manifested as responses of the human body to environmental changes both inside and outside. Sa(思) is a major cognitive activity, and the other six emotions are main emotional activities. The emphasis on the interrelationship between cognition, sentiment, and emotional activity is a unique characteristic of the Jeongji(情志) concept in China. Jeongji[Mental] disorder refers to a series of diseases that has a close link between the attack, clinical presentation and emotional stimulation. The attack is deeply affected by emotional stimulation, with which physical symptoms are either present or absent. However, emotional changes are clear most of the time, their effect on disease development noticeable as well. To sum up, Jeongji[Mental] disorder is related to a wide range of medical problems in fields such as internal, surgical, gynecology, pediatrics, and various psychiatric disorders, not to mention contemporary psychological disorders, neurosis, and all kinds of mental illnesses of today. Moreover, the mental and physical disorders of today all share a common pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment discipline. All the more reason for deeper professional research.",

The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural.

Por otra parte, se ha planteado que los depresivos han estado sometidos a intenso stress, volviendose maladaptativos sus sistemas reguladores porque producen un exceso o un defecto en sus funciones. Se plantea que las ansiedades paranoides y depresivas ante las perdidas y necesidades amorosas insatisfechas - por una combinacion variable, y a veces directamente proporcional, de frustraciones y requerimientos constitucionales excesivos - asi como los mecanismos de defensa correlacionados con estas, conducen a una tension mas o menos permanente que genera un estado de desesperanza y agotamiento, tanto psiquico como fisiologico, que se manifiesta como depresion.",

Behavior disturbances, recognized as due to the encephalitis, because of an acute onset following a typical epidemic encephalitis history, are nearly always accompanied by some neurologic findings in the form of pupillary changes, facial paresis, muscle stiffness, etc. These behavior disturbances have been shown to be typical of an organic brain disease quite unlike the usual behavior disturbances in children. It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa. Originally the behavior of a child was pronounced postencephalitic when the following three conditions were fulfilled: (1) a sudden change in personality, (2) physical evidence of postencephalitis and (3) a history of acute epidemic encephalitis.

Examples of a traumatic crisis is the death of a near relative, the sudden onset of a severe illness, a sudden infidelity in marriage etc. So called transitional life situations may also elicit crisis reaction, i.e. the birth of a first child, retirement from work etc. A psychic crisis is often overdetermined from experiences in early childhood. The more \"pure\" crisis reactions are often seen in medical or surgical clinics while the psychiatrists usually meet the overdetermined crisis reaction. Four different phases of the crisis reaction are described. The goal of crisis therapy is to support the individual's and his surroundings own resources. It is not to replace the loss or to help the individual deny the emotional impact of what has happened. The function of the therapist can often be described in terms of \"containing function\" and \"vicarious hope\". Listening to a client in acute crisis often evokes feelings of anxiety and helplessness in the therapist. He often feels seduced to behave omnipotently, helping the patient to suppress the feelings of sorrow and anger. He may also be overprotective or may avoid discussing the pertinent feelings. The antitherapeutic risks of crisis psychotherapy are discussed and also illustrated with examples from the author's research on reactions of mothers to the birth of stillborn children.",

Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często.

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic pain may be as high as 20-50 %. Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

PMS can be identified based on the presence of at least one behavioral symptom and one physical symptom during the 5 days prior to menses and relieved after the onset of menses. Laboratory testing is rarely needed but may consider on an individual basis. Treatments are used in a stepwise approach with increasing order of complexity.

In the works of Russian and foreign scientists, the phenomenon of “burnout” is studied as “medical” and “psychological” issue and is considered in terms of its causes, symptomatology and functional peculiarities. The key factor of burnout is a prolonged stay in unfavorable conditions of the social environment, the reason may be stressful mental states and an existential crisis caused by a mismatch of ideological values and expectations with reality. Burnout has a cumulative effect and is interpreted as a consequence of permanent stress in the workplace and activities outside the profession. The signs of emotional burnout are interpreted in connection with the social characteristics of the activity because they arise as a result of non-constructive communication which is traumatic for the psyche in a wide range of life activities. The clinical nature of emotional burnout is diagnosed at the theoretical and empirical levels. Emotional burnout has the status of a syndrome – a pathological state of the psyche with certain symptoms. The symptoms of emotional burnout are considered relying on experimental research devoted to distinctive features of the stress among students and educators in Russian higher educational institutions. The psychological theory of adaptation characterizes the phenomenon of emotional burnout as a vital function of psychological protection, which serves to stimulate the psyche in the process of resistance to the effects of stress.",

      "abstract": "There are psychiatric disorders in dentistry, which because of lack of recognition have not been well documented. Some of the disorders pose management difficulties to the dentist because he is not trained to recognise them. For instance disorders that have psychological or multifactorial aetiology, which tend to characterise mental illness are not well treated. Pain is the commonest reason for the patient to visit the dentist. If the pain is non-organic, the diagnosis and management pose a problem to the dentist. Most pains that arise from psychological illness exist in association with personality and neurotic disorders. These disorders include dentophobia, stress, bruxism and more severe conditions associated with behavioural problems or dysfunctions. The dentist ought to be trained in rudimentary Psychiatry to be able to recognise and determine when psychiatric referral is necessary. We therefore, advocate the teaching of Psychiatry to dental students, which would focus predominantly on their needs.

      "title": "Management of Hypertension Complicated by Psychiatric Comorbidity",
      "abstract": "Diverse psychosocial forces can impact hypertension and its clinical care. Chronic mental stress is possibly a cause of essential hypertension. Opinions on this are polarized, no doubt partly because the occupational health litigation dimensions of the subject are so divisive. White coat hypertension has psychologic roots that remain enigmatic; introversion and shyness have been implicated. The apparent blood pressure (BP) surges of labile hypertension can be real, artifactual, or illusory; psychologic factors are operative in some instances via panic attacks and episodic life stress. Panic disorder not uncommonly coexists with hypertension, confounding the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and influencing antihypertensive drug choices; panic attacks can masquerade as hypertensive emergencies. Obsessive compulsive disorder can transform home BP measurement into a compulsive, ritualized component of the illness. Depressive illness and schizophrenia may coexist with hypertension through prescribed psychotropic drugs causing weight gain and BP elevation. Attitudinal barriers to treatment, beyond explicit psychopathology, do exist; antidrug ideology, psychologic denial, and indifference to life itself are examples. In nearly 40 years of medical practice involving primarily the care of patients with high BP in Canberra, Australia; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Melbourne, Australia, it has been impressed on one of the authors (ME) that some patients are extraordinarily difficult to help. These are the patients who make the heart sink when their names are seen on the patient list for the day, because of past and ongoing therapeutic failure with them. This failure is usually not a result of them having the most severe hypertension. More often than not, it results from the presence of psychiatric illness coexisting with their hypertension or a personality that impinges adversely, in various ways, on the doctor-patient therapeutic alliance. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity are common in hypertension clinics. This can result from medical referral biases, with somatic symptoms or morbid health preoccupations in depression and anxiety disorders leading to the initial medical presentation and subsequent referral. In addition, the prevalence of some psychiatric illness is genuinely increased in patients with essential hypertension; an example is panic disorder.1 Further, some drugs used in psychiatric care can cause hypertension secondary to weight gain. In this commentary, we try to formulate the common psychosocial reasons for therapeutic failure with hypertensive patients and describe some of the characteristics of everyone's \"difficult\" patient. This could only be possible with the input of both the clinical experience of the hypertensionologist (ME) and the psychiatric expertise of his wife (RS), who tried to make sense of his uncomprehending and psychiatrically naive complaints at the end of the working day. Together, we have prepared this commentary in the hope that in the future, treatment of the problem patient might be a little less daunting. The prevalence of panic disorder is increased in patients with essential hypertension. This represents a special case of a broader phenomenon, the high level of anxiety disorder, often undiagnosed, in medical practice in general.2 With panic disorder and hypertension, there is almost certainly a true increase in comorbidity,1 but medical referral and attendance biases also contribute to the apparent link. Further, some antihypertensive drugs seem capable of initiating panic disorder. α-Adrenergic drugs that cause recurring postural hypotension accompanied by dizziness, palpitations, and sweating are a case in point. The mechanism appears to be analogous to that operating when recurrent cardiac arrhythmias, particularly supraventricular tachycardia, cause panic disorder by sensitizing the patient to cardiac symptoms.3 The presence of panic disorder can confound hypertension diagnoses. A panic attack accompanied by marked BP increase can lead to a misdiagnosis of hypertension sufficiently severe to constitute a medical emergency. Differentiating panic disorder from pheochromocytoma can be difficult, which is explicitly acknowledged in the use of the term pseudopheochromocytoma applied in patients in whom anxiety disorder masquerades as an adrenal medullary tumor.4,5 Similar symptoms can occur with both, accompanied by BP surges. Twenty-four-hour urinary catecholamine excretion can be misleading; urinary adrenaline excretion can be elevated 2- to 3-fold in patients with panic disorder if the collection period includes a panic attack. The invariable sense of dread at the very onset of panic attack, not typical of a pheochromocytoma episode, is a helpful discriminator. Hypertensive patients with anxiety disorder can generate worrying symptoms by hyperventilating, which often leads to unnecessary medical investigations.6 Persons experiencing panic can also misinterpret their symptoms as drug side effects. These \"side effects\" are to be curtailed by the doctor or in a short order all antihypertensives in the pharmacopeia will be tried, but discontinued, on spurious grounds. Panic disorder usually responds well to selective serotonin reuptake-blocking drugs and to cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. β-Adrenergic-blocking drugs are a useful addition, helpful in treating both the panic disorder and the hypertension. In some patients, BP is materially higher at the time of medical consultation than when self-recorded in the home or measured with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; this is the so-called white coat effect.7 Despite these forms of BP measurement being regarded as the gold standard, the error occasionally can be in the home BP record, such as in the patient who takes multiple measurements, searching for their \"best\" (lowest) BP level, which might perhaps be found after a hot shower and duly recorded. Not surprisingly, the clinic BP in persons such as these will be higher. Much more usual is active elevation of BP at the time of the medical consultation. The precise origins of the white coat effect remain uncertain. It is sometimes attributed to a stereotyped, conditioned anxiety response, but this is unlikely because if it is true, extinction of the response would be expected with the flooding exposure of repeated clinic visits and BP measurements. The white coat effect usually persists across multiple visits,7 often for many years. Our personal experience is that the white coat effect seems to be prominent in shy and rather self-conscious patients for whom the uncomfortable intimacy of the consultation is the trigger for the BP elevation (and not uncommonly, blushing). There is systematic support for this idea in a Japanese study8 in which researchers found that white coat reactors scored low on the Eysenck extroversion scale (ie, they had high introversion). Eysenck argued that the highly introverted, in particular, find social interactions aversive. Further support comes from a study in Italian patients9 that reported that the white coat phenomenon was highly correlated with an increase in BP during public speaking, a stereotypic challenge to the introverted. Patients with white coat hypertension do not have greater BP response across the board to stressors in general. Does this formulation provide a strategy for overcoming the measurement artifact that white coat hypertension entails? Not really; training the patient in BP self-recording remains the preferred option. BP is very fluid in its responses to the internal environment and to life events. White coat hypertension has its origins in this phenomenon. In some patients, the day-to-day variability of BP seems to be greater than usual (as distinct from white coat hypertension, which is a constant in the clinic7). This is used as a diagnostic discriminator, in their being categorized as labile hypertensives. To some, family physicians and medical generalists in particular, this diagnostic designation ranks in importance with some other recognized hypertension subclasses, such as essential, secondary, and malignant hypertension. Hypertension specialists are less accepting of the existence of labile hypertension as a discrete entity. Some deny its existence.10 Others would suggest that although excess BP lability can be illusory, or artifactual, it is sometimes real and diagnostically important (Table I). In some patients, such as those with panic disorder or episodic life stresses, labile hypertension is real enough and psychogenic. In people with severe, recurring life stresses, BP can be the \"barometer\" of their level of distress. Others may perhaps have inexplicable surges of sympathetic nervous system activity sometimes categorized as autonomic epilepsy: a murky, poorly understood characteristic of a few patients with essential hypertension. In some patients, such as those with borderline BP elevation, lability of hypertension is illusory.10 BP recorded in the clinic, while actually showing the usual degree of variability, creates an illusion of greater fluctuation than normal by oscillating around the cutoff for the diagnosis of established hypertension.10 In other patients, high BP lability is artifactual, a consequence of the auscultatory gap phenomenon in which there is a premature disappearance of sounds with subsequent return as the cuff is further deflated. Labile hypertension diagnosed from hospital charts is notoriously of this form. Some careful interns and residents, in avoiding the auscultatory gap artifact by estimating the BP by pulse as a preliminary measure, have recorded the BP accurately, while those who are less careful have missed the true systolic pressure and recorded the lower BP when the disappearing auscultatory sounds reappear. The labile hypertension not to be missed is that accompanying pheochromocytoma. Extreme BP variability, with associated symptoms, is the clinical hallmark of this dangerous tumor of the adrenal medulla and sympathetic chain. Measurement of catecholamines and their metabolite in urine and/or plasma will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The notion that chronic mental stress can cause hypertension was an idea in the past often banished to the realm of medical folklore. The general public has needed little persuasion that the link exists, sometimes even using the word \"hypertensive\" as a psychologic descriptor for describing excitable or agitated behavior. Many personally relate to the \"tense\" in \"hypertension\" and may be too ready to attribute their elevated BP to stress in their job or in their domestic life. Although some uncertainty still exists concerning the role of stress in the pathogenesis of human hypertension, clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory research does provide increasingly strong support.11,12 Our own recent research seems to identify the presence of stress biomarkers in patients with essential hypertension.13 In our own country, in an admittedly contentious judgment, an Australian governmental body, the Specialist Medical Review Council, ruled that stress, including stress in the workplace, is one proven cause of hypertension.14 How effective are relaxation therapies, such as relaxation training, meditation, and yoga, and structured stress reduction strategies in domestic and working lives as antihypertensive therapy? Certainly much less effective than expected from this account. Among nonpharmacologic therapies, weight reduction and exercise outrank relaxation therapies and stress reduction strategies in antihypertensive efficacy.15 Patients with depression commonly present with somatic complaints and are incidentally found to have elevated BP. Their negativity can make them sensitive to adverse drug effects. If they are seen by their primary care physicians as \"problem patients,\" they will be more likely than usual to be referred to a hypertension specialist. Depressive illness seems to be common in hospital hypertension clinics, due primarily to this bias in hypertension detection and medical referral. Essential hypertension and depressive illness do not seem to be causally linked other than through adverse drug effects. In the old days, this was due to some antihypertensive drugs causing depressive illness; centrally acting antihypertensives such as reserpine and methyldopa could do this. Now the wheel has turned, with psychotropic drugs sometimes causing hypertension, primarily through promoting weight gain; this leads to hypertension as a component of the metabolic syndrome.16,17 Much of what has been said about drug-induced hypertension in patients with depressive illness applies also for those with schizophrenia. Classic antipsychotic drugs, novel antipsychotics such as olanzapine, antidepressants of all types (including selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blockers such as venlafaxine), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including paroxetine, prescribed for accompanying depressive illness can cause extreme weight gain, diabetes, and hypertension in patients with schizophrenia.16,17 The tendency for individual psychotropic drugs to cause weight gain is variable, both between patients and across drug classes. Some psychotropic drugs are much more likely than others to cause weight gain (Table II). These should be avoided if possible in those patients who have developed the metabolic syndrome. Schizophrenia is often associated with other cardiac risk factors such as smoking and physical inactivity, making avoidance of obesity and hypertension doubly important. What antihypertensive medication is preferred in psychotropic drug-induced obesity-related hypertension? Although this remains somewhat speculative, there are some pointers. A case for preferential prescribing of antiadrenergic antihypertensive drugs that target the known pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension, activation of the sympathetic nervous system,18 can be advocated on theoretic grounds, but at present there is little empiric evidence to support this. Perhaps more important is the requirement that chosen antihypertensives do not cause weight gain or increase insulin resistance, predisposing to the development of diabetes. High-dose diuretics are best avoided, if possible, on the latter grounds. β-Adrenergic-blocking drugs also are not ideal,19 having been found in large trials to cause some weight gain, perhaps 1 to 2 kg on average, and to predispose to the development of diabetes.19,20 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been especially recommended, as they appear to be antidiabetic.21 The imidazoline-binding agents such as rilmenidine and moxonidine, which are not available in United States, inhibit sympathetic outflow from the brain, cause weight loss of 1 to 2 kg on average, and increase insulin sensitivity.20,22 Perhaps this is a drug class of the future for obesity-related hypertension? Overall, compliance with treatment instructions is not good in patients with essential hypertension. This perhaps is not surprising for an illness in which treatment rather than relieving existing symptoms aims to achieve the delayed benefits of future freedom from myocardial infarction and stroke. Psychiatric illness can further impair compliance. Negativity and lack of volition in those with comorbid depressive illness or schizophrenia compromises medications taking. So do anxiety disorders; in this case the reason is that somaticized symptoms of anxiety are mistaken for adverse effects of the antihypertensive drugs and the drugs are then stopped. Patients can have high levels of hostility, including some with obsessive compulsive illness, which tends to turn the therapeutic encounter into an unproductive tug-of-war with the physician; treatment recommendations can be resisted. Undiagnosed alcohol abuse, a cause of hypertension, can unfavorably influence attitudes toward health care. Some patients have a strongly held doctrinaire distrust of medication, which they view as potentially toxic, and are reluctant to start treatment, or if they do, they surreptitiously reduce the dose. Some patients may not really wish to get well at all. There are those whose reaction to illness, because of secondary gain or for reasons known only to themselves, prevents recovery. These can be the most difficult patients of all to treat, even for doctors with specialty psychiatric training. When BP measured in the doctor's office or the clinic is misleading, skewed by a white coat effect, self-measurement at home is recommended. Psychiatric comorbidity, however, can render home BP measurement a burden for the doctor and patient alike. Home BP measurement should be orderly, along a regular and proscribed path, with BP values perhaps being carefully tabulated to give a helpful overall depiction of the situation to the doctor at the next medical visit. In patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the timing of BP measurement is often chaotic, driven by the presence of symptoms of anxiety which suggest to the patient that BP is high. When it is, because of the acute anxiety, a path of escalating anxiety and escalating BP may commence, perhaps continuing throughout the day with literally dozens of measurements and more often than not terminating in an anguished late evening phone call to the doctor. Home BP measurement may be too anxiety-engendering for some patients to tolerate. Tabulated home BP measurements, perhaps with an overall summary, are a very helpful aid to the doctor when patients attend clinic visits. Some occupational groups—engineers and accountants come to mind—do this comprehensively and well, often providing elaborate computer printouts of graphs constructed over months derived from 3 or 4 daily BP measurements. This level of attention to detail is usually not really necessary but is helpful nevertheless. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the repeated measurement of BP is sometimes taken to extraordinary levels, with perhaps 40 to 50 measurements daily, this activity sometimes replaces other prior compulsions, such as ritual hand washing. In these cases, home BP measurement has become an expression of the patients' illness and they are better off not doing it. Beyond psychiatric diagnosis, attitudinal barriers to effective treatment of hypertension may be present. Such barriers can be ideologic, as in a zealotry that takes the form of the opinion that \"drugs are poison and made by a corrupt pharmaceutical industry.\" Denial can be a barrier, as in the patients who persistently search for their \"best\" BP, taking home BP measurements under circumstances they have learned will yield lower BP values, such as after a hot bath. An overvaluing of the power of positive thinking can also be a barrier to treatment in patients who believe that they should be able to control their BP by strength of will alone, such that a need to take antihypertensive medication equates with failure and personal weakness. It can actually represent indifference to survival, particularly, it seems, in elderly men. We have found that the magic words to motivate here are \"strokes\" and \"grandchildren\"—antihypertensive medication-taking can be driven by fear of the first and love for the second!

      "title": "Psychological Trauma",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder is the quintessential mind/body disorder that alters physiological, biological, and psychological homeostasis. People who have been traumatized often present with distressing and frequently intractable psychosomatic symptoms, often without knowing consciously that the source of their symptoms is the trauma they experienced. The stress response may be considered to exist along a continuum: eustress, stress, and traumatic stress. Traumatic stress precipitates a condition of physiological and psychobiological imbalance in the nervous system and in the endocrine, immune, and neuropeptide systems. Some evidence suggests that discrimination may constitute a stressor and contribute to a greater lifetime allostatic load. Conversely, social relationships mitigate the effects of allostatic load. This intersects with a new model of stress response called \"tend and befriend.\" Learned helplessness intersects with the central assertion of state-dependent memory, learning, and behavior: what we learn and remember is dependent on our psychophysiological state at the time of the experience.",

      "abstract": "Abnormal bereavement and distress disorders are prevalent and carry a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. Many family doctors are used to seeing patients who have experienced life events that lead to psychological disturbance. Bereavement can be defined as the period of mourning and grief that follows the death of a loved one. Mourning consists of the rituals and symbolic behaviour that follow such a death. Bereavement is an experience that virtually all individuals will experience at some point in their lives. Key tasks for health-care professionals include the possession of good knowledge about the normal spectrum of bereavement reactions, skills in promoting grieving, and an ability to identify when a grief reaction has become abnormal, prolonged or complex, or when it has developed into a mental illness such as depression.",

      "title": "Panic Attacks in the Natural Environmet",
      "abstract": "Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal conrols kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/ discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.",

It is a unique and extraordinary case of a type of psychological development and alteration of consciousness and its functions that can shed light on the normal organization of consciousness. Most importantly, it can shed light on the normal organization of the relations of consciousness to its functions and on its normal course of development. In this sense, the psychological study of schizophrenia perhaps contains the key to understanding the structure of normal consciousness. In any case, the psychological study of schizophrenia, which has not yet advanced very far, should enable us to approach normal human consciousness from the standpoint of a psychological laboratory experiment.",

      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

      "abstract": "Un porcentaje considerable de pacientes que\r\nsobrevive a un ingreso en una unidad de cuidados\r\ncriticos puede presentar secuelas psicologicas\r\ndespues del alta. La gravedad de los sintomas es\r\nvariable y puede ir desde la ansiedad, pesadillas o\r\nmiedos hasta la depresion y sindrome de estres\r\npostraumatico que imposibilita llevar una vida\r\nnormal. Por su parte, los familiares de los pacientes\r\nque fallecen presentan una incidencia aun mayor de\r\nsintomas ansiosos y depresiones graves.\r\nAunque la etiologia de estas alteraciones no esta\r\ncompletamente establecida, si existen indicadores\r\nclaros de que pueden estar relacionadas tanto con\r\nlos episodios traumaticos como con las vivencias\r\nexperimentadas por el paciente y el recuerdo que\r\nquede de las mismas.\r\nEl presente articulo pretende reflexionar sobre la\r\nrealidad que se vive en las unidades de cuidados\r\ncriticos y el olvido de que suelen ser objeto el\r\nsufrimiento del paciente y de sus allegados, asi\r\ncomo las dificultades de comunicacion que existen.\r\nPretende tambien argumentar, sobre la base de\r\nobservaciones clinicas y de recientes estudios\r\npublicados, de que modo la actitud adoptada por los\r\nprofesionales puede influir tanto en la forma de vivir\r\nla experiencia como en el impacto que esta pueda\r\ntener en el futuro.\r\nEl paciente critico -aquel que esta en riesgo de morir\r\nreal o potencial con una relativa inmediatez- se\r\nconvierte, por el mero hecho de serlo, en un ser\r\nfragil y facilmente vulnerable. En las unidades de\r\ncuidados criticos se viven situaciones de dolor y\r\nmolestias fisicas (pinchazos, sondas, sed o falta de\r\nsueno), pero tambien situaciones de gran\r\nsufrimiento por el miedo, la soledad o el panico que\r\nprovoca la cercania de la muerte. Ademas, la propia\r\nenfermedad o la administracion de sedantes\r\n(imprescindibles para tolerar ciertos procedimientos\r\nterapeuticos) pueden provocar estados de\r\nsemiinconsciencia (delirio) que hacen dificil la\r\npercepcion de los limites de la realidad, y esta\r\nconfusion entre lo real y lo que no lo es puede dar\r\nlugar a emociones inquietantes que pueden\r\nperdurar en el tiempo y condicionar la vida posterior.\r\nEn estas circunstancias, el enfermo necesita y\r\nreclama dos tipos de ayuda: La primera, la\r\nresolucion del proceso fisiopatologico que le trajo\r\nhasta aqui y para el que la medicina moderna esta\r\npreparada (aunque no siempre lo consiga). La\r\nsegunda, mas sutil, menos explicita, pero igualmente\r\nimportante, la de la comprension de la situacion que\r\nvive, la empatia con su dolor, su desazon, su\r\nirracionalidad incluso, su situacion concreta y la\r\natencion a la globalidad de su persona y no solo a\r\nsus organos enfermos.\r\nEl efecto terapeutico que se deriva de mantener una\r\nbuena comunicacion con los enfermos es\r\nindiscutible. Y debe entenderse “comunicacion” en\r\ntoda la extension de la palabra, y no solo como el\r\npequeno componente que supone la comunicacion\r\nverbal.\r\nEl verdadero proceso comunicativo capaz de prestar\r\nal paciente la ayuda necesaria es aquel que se\r\nmueve sin miedo por el mundo de las emociones, de\r\nlas actitudes, del respeto y del verdadero interes por\r\nel otro.\r\nPor su parte, los familiares del enfermo precisan\r\ntambien de una atencion especial por cuanto son\r\nparte del mundo del paciente, viven el proceso y\r\nsufren con el. Entre ellos, la presencia de sintomas\r\nde ansiedad o depresion es todavia mas frecuente\r\n(el recuerdo es siempre vivido y no contiene\r\nelementos “ilusorios”), sobre todo entre aquellos\r\ncuyo familiar fallecio despues de habersele aplicado\r\nalgun tipo de limitacion de tratamiento y de haber\r\ncompartido la decision con los profesionales que le\r\natendian.\r\nLa participacion de los familiares en este tipo de\r\ndecisiones es habitual, puesto que los enfermos no\r\nsuelen encontrarse en condiciones de decidir por si\r\nmismos. En estos casos, las conversaciones suelen\r\nser complejas y dificiles y tienen lugar en un clima de\r\nalta tension emocional. Del modo como se manejen\r\nestas situaciones, de como el profesional sea capaz\r\nde fomentar un clima de confianza, permitiendo que\r\nse expresen y articulen los valores y las preferencias\r\ndel paciente, y de como preste ayuda al familiar para\r\nencarar los tan frecuentes sentimientos de culpa o\r\ncualquier otro tipo de emocion negativa puede\r\nderivarse un efecto beneficioso que “cura”, suaviza\r\ny alivia o, por el contrario, uno negativo que\r\nacrecienta el dolor, la rabia o la impotencia. Varios\r\nestudios publicados refuerzan la teoria de que la\r\nsatisfaccion y el bienestar posteriores de los\r\nfamiliares de enfermos graves estan muy\r\nrelacionados con la calidad de estas entrevistas. La\r\nduracion total tiene un valor indiscutible, pero mucho\r\nmas aun la percepcion de que existe coherencia por\r\nparte del equipo asistencial y sobre todo el tiempo\r\ndedicado a la escucha. Los familiares que emplearon\r\nmas tiempo hablando presentaron unos indices de\r\nansiedad mas bajos.\r\nPor ultimo, se intenta tambien aventurar cuales\r\npueden ser algunas de las dificultades reales que\r\nexisten en la practica diaria para llevar a cabo esta\r\nescucha, tales como los habitos de trabajo\r\npropiciados por la misma evolucion de la especialidad\r\nque se ha dedicado mas a los procesos organicos y\r\na la tecnologia aplicada que a las vivencias de los\r\npacientes, la prisa entendida como un modo de\r\nactuar estresado, precipitado o impaciente en\r\ncontraposicion con lo cuidadoso, reflexivo y pausado,\r\nla concepcion de la profesionalidad que prima las\r\nhabilidades cientifico-tecnologicas sobre las de\r\nrelacion, comunicacion y empatia, o el miedo que se\r\nmanifiesta de distintas formas y ante muchas cosas,\r\ncomo el descontrol de las situaciones, el ridiculo,\r\no el propio sufrimiento o muerte.\r\nPor ultimo, se sugieren algunos de los puntos en los\r\nque se podria incidir para intentar mejorar el estado\r\nactual de las cosas. En primer lugar la docencia; es\r\nimperativo que a los estudiantes de medicina se les\r\nfamiliarice desde muy pronto con disciplinas como la\r\netica, la filosofia, el derecho o las habilidades de\r\ncomunicacion para hacerlos mas\r\nsensibles/perspicaces a la hora de considerar al\r\nindividuo enfermo en toda su dimension (biologica y\r\nbiografica), y dotarles de instrumentos para hacer\r\nfrente a las situaciones dificiles que viviran. En\r\nsegundo lugar, otras posibles propuestas son:\r\nfomentar ambientes sosegados en los hospitales,\r\nsin ruidos innecesarios, con salas de espera o de\r\ninformacion mas acogedoras, sensibilizar a las\r\ngerencias sobre la importancia de los tiempos\r\ndedicados a la comunicacion para que sean\r\ncontabilizados como parte integrante de la\r\nasistencia, o liberalizar los horarios de las visitas en\r\nlas unidades de cuidados criticos para permitir que\r\nse creen espacios menos artificiales de\r\ncomunicacion entre profesionales y familiares.",

      "title": "The Nature of Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is arbitrary, being based on criteria defined by consensus rather than specific biologic markers. IBS is merely a consortium of symptoms and as presently defined is no more a disease than dyspnea or fatigue are diseases. In this context, it is therefore not surprising that defining the nature of pain has proven elusive. It is often etiologically assumed that the origins of the pain seen in IBS patients are mechanistically distinct from those of some of the other symptoms of IBS such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition pain is assumed to be part of a continuum ranging from complete absence of any pain to varying degrees of discomfort to severe pain. Both of these assumptions should be challenged: there are no data to support the notion that discomfort and pain experienced in IBS are mediated through different pathways than symptoms such as bloating or that they are not merely the consequence of the physiological perturbations associated with altered bowel function. Similarly one can easily argue that visceral pain may actually be the cause rather than the effect of the altered gut function seen in IBS. Abdominal discomfort could then be the consequence of the latter and be only indirectly related to pain. It is likely that central (such as stress) and peripheral factors (such as intestinal infection) will produce similar symptoms but via markedly different pathways. It may be time to deconstruct IBS as a concept and to approach the clinical picture from a mechanistic rather than a phenomenological perspective, particularly if we are interested in understanding the basis of the symptoms and develop effective therapeutic modalities. Our patients deserve no less.",

The reliability and validity of measures is not entirely satisfactory. When the stress concept used is that of ‘threat’ or ‘emotional distress’ it becomes of crucial importance to define clearly the criterion variable: in particular, it is necessary to distinguish normal distress responses from depressive illness. In those studies using general practice or hospital patients it is important to determine whether life events provoke depressive illness or some illness behaviour such as service utilization.

The onset of psychotic symptoms during the postpartum period is considered a psychiatric emergency. This usually occurs in the first two weeks after childbirth. The etiology of postpartum psychosis is not fully known, but genetic and hormonal factors appear to be related. Women with history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, family history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, first pregnancy and recent discontinuation of lithium have increased risk to develop postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis usually presents as a combination of psychotic and mood disorder symptoms. In some cases, patient's mental status is altered. These women have a higher risk of suicide and infanticide. Other causes of psychosis should be excluded, such as intoxication or drug withdrawal, metabolic encephalopathy, endocrine dysfunction or central nervous system lesions. An acute approach should include hospitalization, antipsychotic medication and treatment of the underlying disorder. Prophylactic treatment with mood stabilizers should be considered in women previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis episodes can be severe and prolonged, and may affect bonding between mother and infant.",

Como parte del espectro sintomatico de la ansiedad, algunas de sus representaciones somaticas se relacionan con equilibrio y oido interno. Con frecuencia se encuentra relacion entre la sintomatologia neuropsiquiatrica y otorrinolaringologica. Las estadisticas internacionales asi lo senalan. En Colombia no hay datos especificos al respecto, aunque se encuentra informacion de patologias individuales. El abordaje de estos pacientes debe ser integral, y con disposicion de la mayor cantidad de informacion clinica y paraclinica posible segun la sospecha diagnostica y con el paciente, se establecen indicadores de logros reales segun el caso. La causalidad o el orden de aparicion de la sintomatologia entre la eminentemente psiquiatrica y la otologica es variable y en muchos casos parece circular. El ver estos sintomas desde la psiquiatria o desde la otorrinolaringologia es un abordaje con frecuencia insuficiente y requiere de la integracion de saberes. Con ese fin se han planteado teorias explicativas en varios sentidos e incluso se han adicionado categorias diagnosticas nuevas.

      "title": "Psychological and Psychosocial Consequences of Combat and Deployment with Special Emphasis on the Gulf War",
      "abstract": "Research in the neurosciences has demonstrated that the boundary between the external world (its events, pressures, concerns and stress) and the brain and body has been broken. The concept of anything being all in the mind is scientifically and intellectually dead. While some data remain ambiguous and direct causal effect cannot be given to stress per se, the overall patterns of research findings demonstrate that stress is a contributing factor to many illnesses, including somatic and psychological symptoms. Therefore, very real consequences attend those who experience prolonged subacute chronic stress, which characterized in the Gulf deployment, combat, and return home. It is feasible that the effects of these stresses made some soldiers more vulnerable to environmental pathogens, both in the theater and at home, than they would otherwise have been. The symptoms of such insults, nested in sociocultural beliefs about illness and the Gulf, might well have amplified deleterious somatic consequences. Like many illnesses, those pertaining to service in the Gulf have been culturally shaped. An illness narrative describes the causes of the illness as perceived by the patient and is most often constructed out of the assertions, metaphors, folklore, causal attributions, and adduced causes common in the patient's culture. Other agents of a presumed authorities, the Internet, and support and self-help groups. Such illness narratives can become an important factor in shaping both the nature and interpretation of symptoms by the patient. A cogent, widespread, and widely shared illness narrative is certainly a characteristic development of Gulf War illness. The threads of combat and deployment stress and the side spectrum of possible responses, as demonstrated throughout history, weaves into the matrix of possible illness causation. It is also possible that a subset of the population is (in some ways, not yet understood) vulnerable and predisposed to injurious responses to the multiple stressors experienced in deployment and combat. This book argues that, to be most helpful to veterans, we must deal with this issue of complexity and not simply focus on a hypothecated or hoped for singular cause of Gulf War illness.",

Diagnostic clues in the history and physical examination are outlined. An early referral to the psychiatric services minimises wastage of time and resources but requires skillful handling and sensitivity on the part of the referrer. Patients do not regard themselves as psychologically abnormal and are often resentful and angry when referred for psychiatric evaluation. Principles of management are described with emphasis on establishing an early rapport. Cognitive behavioural methods appear promising but require further evaluation in controlled studies.",

Perhaps the most important diagnostic judgement in determining the particular kind of depression with which a patient presents has to do with the degree to which the depression has infiltrated the structure of the personality. H. Bleichmar, in a comprehensive review of the different types of depression and the various intrapsychic pathways that lead to their formation, distinguishes between depression that is a component part of many different kinds of disorder and depression as an entity in itself. S. Freud's monumental work on mourning and its relation to clinical depression illuminated how the two conditions–the one usual, ordinary, commonplace, the other pathological–are closely related. This chapter shows that patients with a kind of severe, debilitating depression can be helped with intensive psychoanalytic psychotherapy.",

Each is considered a disorder, diagnosed with a distinct set of diagnostic criteria. Spectrum conveys the idea that they are somehow similar to each other. Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

Stress has been a focal point in psychoneuroimmunology largely because of its demonstrated effects on immune function. It becomes even more intimately involved in nervous system-immune system interactions, because infections and certain other immune challenges can be regarded as stressful. A common human experience is that under acute stress conditions, an impending infection, such as a cold, can be held at bay, but when the pressure is relaxed, one succumbs to the cold. Extensive experimental data from animal and human studies indicate that adrenally compromised individuals are more susceptible to infections, and that this property involves the adrenal cortex rather than the medulla. Infections which activate the immune system appear to act as stressors, probably via the production of cytokines. Thus stress, infection and immune system function are intimately involved in complex relationships critical for the survival of the organism.",

Although this dichotomy between general medical and psychiatric pathology is somewhat dated according to the focus of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition (DSM-5) Somatic Symptom Disorders, the psychogenic description of a medically unexplained symptom is still commonly used in the general medical vernacular. This case report involved a 74-year-old man who was presumed to have “psychogenic” nausea symptoms after a negative medical workup. New tremulous symptoms were presumed to be secondary to a benzodiazepine taper. However, the presence of additional focal neurological deficits prompted a computed tomography of the patient’s head, which revealed a subdural hematoma. Emergent neurosurgical evacuation and drainage relieved the patient’s symptoms and proved to be a life-saving measure. Subdural hematomas are most commonly the result of traumatic tearing of the cortical bridging veins that overlie this subdural space. Subsequent mass effect and ischemia from venous bleeding can cause multiple symptoms, including nausea. This case highlights the importance of ensuring a broad differential for medically unexplained symptoms and close monitoring of symptomatic changes.",

Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, witnessing, or learning about an extreme physically or/and psychologically distressing event. Its incidence and the number of this disease-affected people are threateningly increasing in contemporary society. Therefore, the development of prognostic strategies and novel efficient methods on early diagnostics and treatment of PTSD is currently considered as one of the most important healthcare problems worldwide.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "title": "Refus scolaire et absentéisme à l’adolescence",
      "abstract": "L'absenteisme scolaire a l'adolescence est une preoccupation majeure en France comme dans de nombreux pays. Les causes de ces absences sont variables, multiples et associees : les difficultes emotionnelles, comme l'anxiete ou la depression, les troubles du comportement, les difficultes familiales et sociales, les troubles des apprentissages, le manque de motivation ; elles sont associees eventuellement a des interets predominants presents a l'exterieur de l'ecole. Le refus scolaire anxieux est l'entite la plus etudiee et documentee aussi bien sur le plan descriptif que therapeutique. Il s'agit de jeunes absents de l'ecole pour des raisons principalement anxieuses. Les troubles internalises sous-jacents sont tres souvent retrouves (anxiete et-ou depression) et sont parfois associes a des troubles externalises. La prise en charge est pluridisciplinaire scolaire et psychiatrique : traitement psychotherapique, rescolarisation progressive et guidance parentale. Pour les autres causes d'absenteisme, l'analyse fonctionnelle de chaque situation permet d'elaborer un plan de soins adapte a chaque jeune. Une coordination des differentes interventions est necessaire : scolaire, psychologique, sociale, judiciaire. Le pronostic de l'absenteisme est academique, social et psychiatrique et parait severe en l'absence de traitement adapte : l'absenteisme scolaire et les troubles emotionnels se maintiennent, avec des risques de decrochage scolaire, de troubles de la socialisation et d'aggravation d'autres pathologies psychiatriques. L'equilibre familial est egalement bouleverse. Le reperage de ces adolescents absents de l'ecole peut permettre de leur proposer une intervention adaptee. Dans les cas de refus scolaires anxieux, la prise en charge de l'anxiete permet un retour progressif en scolarite dans la plupart des cas. Pour les autres causes d'absenteisme, les interventions multidisciplinaires permettent d'elaborer un projet de formation, une reprise de la vie sociale, et ainsi de s'inscrire dans un projet de vie plus realiste et constructif.[resume d'auteur]",

This is particularly true of the emotional state which may develop in persons who find themselves in a hazardous situation. For present purposes this emotional state is termed anxiety, although it is recognized that other reactions such as resentment or anger may also occur, depending upon the individual and the circumstances. In any study on unanesthetized human subjects, changes produced by anxiety may mask completely the physiologic or pharmacologic effects which are obvious in a relaxed subject. In the interpretation of experimental data. objective criteria by which it can be established, or even suspected, that anxiety is having an effect on cardiovascular function are useful.

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

      "title": "Grief: Aetiology, Symptoms and Management",
      "abstract": "Abstract Grief is a process provoked as a response to different losses, such as death, loss of job, relationship breakdown, some unexpected life events and changes, etc. The experiences of loss and bereavement are very individual. Even though loss is expected, the person feels traumatized, especially if death is provoked by violence, natural disasters, or war. This pandemic, like other disasters (wars, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, etc.) has provoked intensive reactions of grief, reactions that could persist for years. The core symptoms of grief are described in the ICD-11 and DSM-5 manuals. The term “complicated grief” in the medical sense refers to a superimposed process that alters grief and modifies its course for the worse. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is characterized by normal grief symptoms, but these are symptoms that remain too intense for too long of a period. This article is a review of the manifestations and duration of grief in different occasions, and it is based on over 50 published papers, and discoveries in the Medline and Psych-Net databases. Commonly described reactions to grief are: shock, disbelief or denial, a high level of anxiety, distress, anger, sadness, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. As predictors for a high/slow decreasing trajectory of grief process are: female gender, reported symptoms of depression before the traumatic event, and higher scores on avoidance. However, grief is transient, even as we are is in the midst of its clutches. People should expect to fluctuate between moments of sadness and mourning, and moments of acceptance, or even happiness for being alive. Researchers suppose that when a crisis passes; most people will be able to bounce back and move on with their lives.",

One of the most frequently diagnosed, yet under recognized diseases, is depression. Depression, whether a symptom, part of a syndrome or an independent diagnosis, is characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and pleasure in activities that normally bring joy to a person, and can affect how a person feels, thinks and behaves. It affects all age and social groups, as well as both sexes, it is often comorbid with other physical diseases, and increases the risk of developing other physical diseases. There are certain differences between the sexes in the prevalence, the way a certain sex group deals with problems caused by depression, and the possible causes of these differences, which we present in more detail in this paper. Differences are observed in all cultures, environments and across different age groups. Patients suffering from depression have a particularly high risk of committing suicide. Suicide is a psychopathological phenomenon of multifactorial aetiology that is most often associated with psychiatry and mental disorders and is not a diagnosis in itself, but a complication of many psychiatric disorders. here are many differences in the rate of suicide by age and sex, as well as in the method of suicide, which we also present in more detail in this paper.",

Possible psychological, social and biochemical determinants are reviewed, but no firm inferences on causation can yet be drawn. Conflicting results in the literature may have been due to variations in definition and measurement of the syndrome. The authors have recently used psychometric methods to develop a questionnaire for detecting and measuring Maternity Blues. By cluster analysis of responses to the questionnaire, a 'Primary Blues' cluster was defined, consisting of 7 items: tearful, tired, anxious, over-emotional, up and down in mood, low spirited, muddled in thinking.

The prognosis and treatment weigh significantly on identifying the underlying pathophysiology. In many cases, early recognition and detection of the underlying causative etiology may offer the opportunity for stabilization or reversal of the movement disorder. In addition, being familiar with the most common movement disorders associated with a particular medical illness allows the clinician to vigilantly search for and diagnose the systemic disease in its early stages, facilitating more successful intervention. The phenomenological characteristics of a movement disorder must be recognized along the diverse spectrum of underlying causes, mandating a broad differential diagnosis, a detailed history, and careful neurological examination, particularly when multiple medical comorbidities are present.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric disorders: post-stroke depression. A review",
      "abstract": "Introduction Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder after stroke, and also the main factor limiting recovery and rehabilitation in stroke patients, which leaded to poor quality of life. A prevalence of 30% is estimated between 1 to 5 years after stroke. More than half of all cases are neither diagnosed nor treated. Objectives The aim of this paper is to review the latest updates regarding post-stroke depression and progress in its diagnosis and treatment. Methods A systematic review of the scientific and clinical literature on PSD was conducted. The review included databases such as PubMed and Cochrane, covering articles from the past 10 years. The scientific evidence obtained was analyzed and synthesized. Results Currently, the diagnosis of PSD is mainly based on the DSM guidelines and combined with various depression scales. Symptoms usually occur within the first three months after stroke, the patient presents symptoms of a depressive episode such as low mood, anhedonia, loss of appetite, sleep disorders, vegetative symptoms or social withdrawal. Several mechanisms, including biological, behavioural, and social factors, are involved in its pathogenesis. The main predictors are personal history or cognitive impairment, as well as sequelae of the stroke. Left hemispheric strokes are those with the highest risk of early depression, as well as small subcortical vessel pathology. Treatment is mainly pharmacological, with SSRIs. The probability of recovery is between 15 and 57% in the first year, with a recurrence of 38% at two years, up to 100% at 15 years. In addition, there is an increase in mortality, especially in those under 65 years of age. Conclusions There are still many unanswered questions in the treatment of PSD, such as the best time to start treatment or the effects of antidepressants on cognition and motor function, among others. Although great advance has been made by researchers, the mechanism of PSD is not completely clear. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a natural reaction to stress, but in some individuals it can develop into a psychopathological condition that persists even after the stress has been resolved. The number of and amount of difficulty associated with stressful life events can be a significant predictor for the development of depression or anxiety-related disorders. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are more likely to report exposure to stressful events than nonanxious individuals. These relationships are even stronger when anxiety and major depression are comorbid within individuals. In addition, anxiety and depression are prominent in many patients with pain disorders. The presence of pain can be seen not only as a possible marker for anxiety, but also as a causative factor. In either of these cases, the presence of persistent painful symptoms should be a strong indication to clinicians that an anxiety disorder may develop or may already be present, and that treatment is needed for both the pain symptoms and the comorbid anxiety. With daily life becoming increasingly more stressful, the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety spectrum disorders become more important. Treating these disorders early can prevent generalized anxiety from developing into more disabling disorders. This monograph reviews the relationship between stressful life events and anxiety as well as comorbidity of pain and anxiety, and examines the somatic symptoms, such as muscle aches, chest pain, and headaches, often associated with anxiety disorders. Available treatments that may be efficacious in the treatment of individuals experiencing comorbid anxiety and pain are discussed as well.",

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety frequently coexist in the same individual, either concurrently or at different times, and numerous studies show that the presence of an anxiety disorder is the single strongest risk factor for development of depression. When the two coexist simultaneously, either as diagnosed disorders or subsyndromal states, they may be viewed as mixed anxiety–depression or as comorbid syndromes, i.e. separate disorders occurring concurrently. Controversy continues over the nature of the relationship between depression and anxiety, some believing they are distinct, separate entities while others – now the majority – view them as overlapping syndromes that present at different points on a phenomenological and/or chronological continuum, and share a common neurobiology, the degree of overlap depending on whether each is described at the level of symptoms, syndrome or diagnosis. Community data likely underestimate true prevalence, since affected individuals frequently present in primary care with somatic, rather than psychological, complaints. Irrespective of the nature of the relationship, patients with both disorders experience significant vocational and interpersonal impairment, and more frequent recurrence, with greater likelihood of suicide, than individuals with single disorders. Various classes of antidepressant drugs offer symptom relief for these patients, the most selective of th SSRIs holding the greatest promise for sustained clinical improvement. Yet, the crucial parameter of successful pharmacotherapy seems to be the length of treatment, ensuring enhancement of the compromised neuroprotective and neuroplastic mechanisms. Further clarification of the relationship is a prerequisite for offering effective treatment to the many patients who experience lifetime depression and anxiety.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results.

Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue. Specific recommendations for patient and family counseling are offered.",

One consistent finding is decrease activity in regions of the brain involved in pain inhibitory pathways suggesting this is one of the fundamental pathophysiology processes in fibromyalgia.",

      "title": "Assessing the impact of breakthrough cancer pain",
      "abstract": "Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background pain. Breakthrough pain is a common and distinct component of cancer pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and generally self-limiting with an average duration of 30-60minutes. Despite the self-limiting nature of breakthrough pain, it can place significant physical, psychological, and economic burdens on both patients and their carers. Patients with breakthrough pain are often less satisfied with their analgesic therapy, they have decreased functioning because of their pain, and may also experience social and psychosocial consequences, such as increased levels of anxiety and depression. Successful management of breakthrough pain is best achieved by a thorough assessment which includes determining the severity, pathophysiology, and aetiology of the pain and takes into account both background and breakthrough pains while considering whether the underlying disease, co-morbidities or precipitating events are amenable to interventions. The features of breakthrough pain and the challenges it presents to patients, their carers, and health professionals are illustrated with a case study.",

      "abstract": "Many patients do not make the link between their anxiety or stress and their physical symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, or even fainting. Instead, they present to their doctors wanting an explanation. Somatisation is one of many labels referring to bodily symptoms in relation to psychosocial distress.1 Other terms in current use are functional illness and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS).2,3\n\nThe incidence of somatising illness is about 30% of new presentations,4 while the cost to the NHS in the UK has been estimated in the billions.3 Many doctors find assessment and management difficult, using investigations to exclude disease before they feel sufficiently confident to explore the possibility of stress-related illness.5 This approach of ‘diagnosis by exclusion’ frequently wastes time and money. It can also lead to ‘somatic fixation’: an overemphasis on physical symptoms and investigations while avoiding personal and psychological issues.6\n\nSomatisation can often be a positive diagnosis, rather than by exclusion.5 Diagnosis at the first consultation is possible by asking specific questions to identify common patterns of somatising illness. These questions can be readily incorporated within the standard biomedical enquiry and …",

The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances.

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

      "abstract": "Death is usually anticipated. Physiological death resulting from senility and the gradual wearing out of organs and tissues is probably an exceptional occurrence. The end usually comes as a culmination of some disease of whose ravages the clinician and the patient are aware. Sometimes it comes with suddenness as the result of an accident, of the imbibition of a poison, or of a sudden turn for the worse in an already existing disease, and sometimes it comes for no apparent reason. It is the unexpected cases of death to which reference is made in this paper. When one hears of an unexpected death, one's mind usually turns to two, or at most three, of the systems of the body. One thinks first perhaps of the circulatory system, and secondarily of the nervous and respiratory systems, and as a matter of fact, the majority of cases of unexpected death may be referred to one of these. But in the course of autopsy experience one learns that there is a wide range, in lesions of these systems, and that the primary cause of the demise may occasionally originate in other systems and tissues, although the actual termination of life may be due to the effect upon one of the three systems previously mentioned. The cases reported have, with a few exceptions been selected from a series of about 1200 autopsies performed at the Hamilton General Hospital during the past ten years. Many of the more unusual observations have been revealed in autopsies done on cases, which have been the subjects of coroner's investigations, and where little or no previous clinical history was available. No doubt some of the so-called unexpected findings",

Unfortunately, there is as yet no simple, definitive test for detecting depression. Family physicians must be aware that depression is very often masked by somatic or anxiety complaints. A pattern of increased office visits, with a constellation of varied functional somatic complaints, perhaps accompanied by disturbances in social relationships, often indicates the presence of a developing depression. Although hospitalization or psychiatric referral or both are in order for complex psychiatric diagnoses or for suicidal patients, the morbidity and the mortality of depression can be reduced by the alert family physician who provides both carefully managed antidepressant treatment and supportive therapy early in the course of the illness.",

      "abstract": "Social Phobia (SP) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorder, characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with social phobia have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of doing things that will embarrass them. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behavior that can severely affect normal daily living. SP usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. A number of studies have emphasized the high co-morbidity of social phobia with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Though clearly elevated there is much debate as to the nature of this relationship. Substance abuse may develop if people try to self-medicate their anxiety and make thamselves more comfortable in social situations. Anxiety may be a result of alcohol or drug abuse due to a substance's anxiogenic effects or through protracted withdrawal syndromes. Substance abusers incur more pathological and unstable life circumstances, making them more susceptible to future stress and anxiety; and there may be a genetic susceptibility in some people which makes them vulnerable to both disorders. The purpose of this article is to summarize research findings on SP and its complex relationship with substance use disorder. Clinical anxiety and substance abuse both warrant treatment and in all likelihood, each helps perpetuate the other.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

These mood disorders are not strongly associated with severity of impairment, demographic characteristics, social supports or prior personal history, but major depression is often strongly associated with left frontal or left basal ganglia lesions and pre-existing subcortical atrophy. While the aetiology of these mood disorders remains unknown, serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction may play a role. Mania is a rare complication of stroke: the clinical presentation and response to treatment are usually the same as mania without brain injury. Post-stroke mania is strongly associated with both a right hemisphere lesion in a limbic-connected area and a second predisposing factor, such as genetic loading for affective disorder, pre-existing subcortical atrophy or seizure disorder. This disorder may be mediated through frontal lobe dysfunction. The lesion method represents a potentially fruitful technique for investigating the mechanisms of affective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Longtemps ignorée, la douleur des personnes souffrant de pathologie mentale et troubles neuro-développementaux tels que les Troubles du Spectre de l’Autisme (TSA) est considérée comme l’une des plus difficiles à prendre en charge. La douleur non exprimée ne joue plus son rôle d’alerte à la menace vitale et contribue à l’augmentation de la mortalité liée à des pathologies somatiques dans ces populations dites vulnérables, notamment chez les adultes avec TSA [1,4], chez qui la prescription de psychotropes compliquent les mesures d’hétéro-évaluations classiques. Certaines études expérimentales ont montrés que ces groupes de patients présentent des particularités nociceptives avec des seuils à la nociception augmentés ou des réactions paradoxales, mais les résultats sont contradictoires [2]. Les causes de ces phénomènes sont mal comprises. Une atteinte des structures cérébrales impliquées dans l’intégration émotionnelle de la douleur (cortex préfrontal), une augmentation de l’activité opiacée, une dissociation paradoxale entre la réponse comportementale et les réactions neurovégétatives, des possibles anomalies des mécanismes excitateurs responsables de la sommation temporelle, ont contrebalancé les hypothèses plus psychopathologiques de troubles de l’expression de la douleur dans cette condition pathologiques développementales [1,3]. En effet, au-delà de l’atteinte des processus cognitifs, les troubles de la communication chez les personnes avec TSA sont à ce jour considérés comme la principale cible des interventions à mener dans les cadres psycho-éducatifs et thérapeutiques afin de mieux prévenir et dépister la douleur chez ces patients hautement vulnérables. Car si communiquer diminue la douleur, la douleur diminue, elle les capacités de communication déjà altérées dans ces troubles, d’où l’enjeu essentiel des stratégies d’aides à la communication ou communication augmentée, qui ne peuvent plus être considérées en 2014 comme un « si besoin… ».",

This branch, like all other branches in medicine and surgery, bows with obedience to its alma mater, because we can not understand the anatomy, pathology and histology of the nervous system, the cerebro-spinal or any other specialized nerve-cell, unless we understand general medicine and the laws of cell-birth, life and growth. My experience, as a general practitioner, prompts me to admit that nothing is more important than the nervous system and its disorders, and yet there is nothing in medicine in which our knowledge is so deficient. In the investigation of even so simple an ailment as headache, the field of medicine must be well examined to know whether the real cause of the pain is vicious heredity, nephritis, lack of exercise,",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders are heterogeneous group of mental disorders with dissociation as dominant symptoms. Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated.

      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain Trigeminal neuralgiaEssentialsTrigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms of intense pain resembling electrical shocks on the other half of the face in the area of one or two of the branches of the trigeminal nerve.Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is not caused by any other disease and there are no findings in imaging investigations.First line drug is carbamazepine.In some patients, the symptom is relieved within a period of a few months, and thus the medication can be gradually reduced after achieving treatment response.Symptoms Between the attacks the pain is totally absent (remission phase), and in the active phase it may be provoked typically by touching certain areas of the face (trigger zones) or by eating. A new pain episode can be provoked after a refractory period that lasts from some seconds to some minutes. The pain comes in very short attacks of shooting pain or ”pins-and-needles” sensations. Additionally, continuous pain may occur. In the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, there are no permanent neurological deficiency symptoms. When at its worst, trigeminal neuralgia may prevent the patient from washing the face or brush the teeth and make her/him unable to speak or even eat and drink. Causes and diagnosis In idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia there is no underlying disease or vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve causing the condition. About 10% of the patients belong to this group. In the majority of patients the symptoms are explained by vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve in the brain stem. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has similar symptoms as the idiopathic form but it is caused by another disease, e.g. MS or a brain stem tumour. Classification of trigeminal neuralgiaPotential trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve.Clinically confirmed trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain may be provoked by a typical stimulus (e.g. breath of wind, touch, eating, movement of the muscles of facial expression).Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia with confirmed aetiology: in addition to the criteria in item 2, vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve is detected by MRI, associated with morphological changes in the trigeminal nerve root (requires 3D reconstruction technique).Secondary trigeminal neuralgia: in addition to the criteria in item 2, an MS plaque or a tumour causing trigeminal neuralgia is detected by MRI.Treatment The drug of choice is carbamazepine which is dosed according to response. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative and may be tried especially if carbamazepine causes adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness) or when there is a need to avoid the interactions of carbamazepine with other drugs. It is a derivative of carbamazepine but better tolerated. Oxcarbazepine is as effective as carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia. The initial dose for carbamazepine is 100 mg × 2 and for oxcarbazepine 150 mg × 2. The dose can be increased up to 1 200 mg/24h with carbamazepine and up to 1 800 mg/24h with oxcarbazepine. In the beginning follow-up of blood cell counts and liver function tests is recommended. Carbamazepine concentration can be measured if there are signs of overdose (dizziness, tiredness, diplopia or nystagmus).Because trigeminal neuralgia has a tendency for spontaneous remission, a trial may be made to taper off the medication gradually after a few months.If trigeminal neuralgia remains refractory to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, the patient is referred to specialized care for therapeutic assessment (e.g. department of neurology or neurosurgery). The most commonly used neurosurgical treatment modalities include coagulation of the trigeminal ganglion and microvascular decompression, i.e. microsurgical release of the nerve compression caused by a small nearby artery . Other drugs may be tried if carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are ineffective or not tolerated and the patient is not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment. There is evidence on the effectiveness of lamotrigine as an add-on drug to carbamazepine (note: risk for skin rash when increasing thedosage). Also baclofen has been shown to have effect in trigeminal neuralgia. Dosage may be increased up to 80 mg/24h if needed. Phenytoin, clonazepam, valproic acid, gabapentine or pregabalin may be tried as secondary alternatives, but there is no evidence of their efficacy. Intravenous phosphenytoin may be tried for severe exacerbations even if its efficacy has not been proven in randomized controlled trials. After the infusion the medication is continued orally aiming at an effective yet tolerable dosage. When one drug is not enough, a combination of several drugs with different action mechanisms may be tried in patients who are not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment.Therapy with botulinum toxin A (25–100 units) may be tried in trigeminus neuralgia refractory to the first-line drugs. Other facial pains Other neuropathic pain in the facial area In another type of facial neuropathic pain, a damage to a branch of the trigeminal nerve has led to a neuropathic pain state. The pain is usually long-term steady aching or burning, and the patient may in addition experience pains resembling electrical shocks.The most common causes of facial neuropathic pain include facial injuries, sequelae of surgical interventions (e.g supraorbital nerve injury in association with Beck's trepanation of the frontal sinus) and postherpetic neuralgia . The pain may also emerge after a disturbance of the cerebral circulation (so-called central post stroke pain). In these patients, the pain and the sensory disturbance do not necessarily limit to the facial area. Careful sensory testing of the face or neurophysiological investigations will reveal abnormal findings.If a patient is diagnosed with facial neuropathic pain of unclear origin, he/she is referred to a neurologist for further investigations. Other facial pain Acute facial pain is most commonly caused by sinusitis or by factors of dental origin. The aetiology may also be a disturbance of the masticatory system, or the pain may be referred from the anterior neck (e.g. thyroiditis) or from the back of the neck (e.g. tension neck).So-called atypical facial pain, also called persistent (or chronic) idiopathic facial pain (PIFP), is a much more common type of prolonged facial pain than trigeminal neuralgia. The pain is usually constant and dull. It is not restricted to one half of the face and is also otherwise independent of dermatomal borders. The pain may be triggered by an intervention directed at the paranasal sinuses or at the teeth (not, however, being a complication of the intervention), infection or stress.PIFP most commonly occurs in middle-aged women. The patients are often subjected to psychosocial stress. Clinical examination of a patient with facial pain includes teeth, masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joints, cervical spine and muscles of the neck and shoulders. It may also be advisable to examine the ears, nose and throat as well as the eyes and the anterior neck.If neuropathic pain is suspected, a neurological examination is important especially concerning the cranial nerves.A patient with severe or progressive facial pain is referred for further investigations to specialized care either to the department of oral diseases, neurology or ENT or to a special pain clinic, according to the local practice guidelines. See also cluster headache . TreatmentOther neuropathic pain in the facial area The treatment of other neuropathic pains in the facial area follows the same conventional principles as the treatment of any neuropathic pain .First-line drugs for neuropathic pain are gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the SNRI group.Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP)PIFP is treated primarily with antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in small dosages, venlafaxine in similar dosage as in the treatment of depression.Other facial painTreatment is determined by the cause of the pain. If the pain is suspected to originate from dental occlusion or from the teeth, the patient is referred to a dentist for assessment.

A relationship between pain and mood has been supported by numerous clinical studies indicating significant comorbidity of chronic pain and various types of depressive illnesses. Besides the assumption that pain is simply a form of stress, the physiological basis for the coexistence of pain and depression is still being investigated. Studies described in this review address some of the cellular and molecular events occurring within the hippocampus that may be common to both pain and stress, possibly reflecting underlying mechanisms of chronic pain-related depression.",

Such emphasis on an atheoretical phenomenology is aimed at enhancing agreement among clinicians and investigators and is expected to facilitate objective research. The process leading to the formation of clinical features, whether psychodynamic, psychophysiologic, or both, is usually considered to be secondary in diagnostic importance (with the exception of recognizable immediate organic or situational causes), and many times is completely ignored. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the exceptions to the above rule because of the emphasis on the past psychologic trauma as the stressor.

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

Psychotic syndromes occur more frequently in individuals who have had a TBI than in the general population. Onset of symptoms can be early or late. Psychosis can occur during the period of post-traumatic amnesia, in association with post-traumatic epilepsy, in association with TBI-related mood disorders, and as a chronic, schizophrenia-like syndrome. TBI can interact with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk of developing illnesses such as schizophrenia. Thorough diagnostic assessment is the foundation of rational and effective pharmacotherapy for psychosis after TBI. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have emerged as first line drugs for treatment of psychotic disorders from all causes, including TBI. Anticonvulsant, antidepressant or other drugs may also be needed in some cases. Medication approaches must be adjusted for the particular characteristics and vulnerabilities of the patient with a TBI.",

Emotions are also associated with problematic changes in the cardiovascular, hormonal and immune system that may lead to allergies, headache, migraine, Arthritis, blood pressure, diabetes and may penetrate its way to the heart which gives you heart attacks. In fact, recent studies show, for over 40 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with depression, the number of people coping (or trying to cope) with loneliness is unknown, and that feeling of not belonging is depressing all by itself. Emotions like anger, fear, Disgust triggers strong sensations in the upper body. Other emotions like depression, sadness and shame shows diminished sensation in the lower body, while some emotions combined both type of response. Though emptions are created in the brain, they can be manifest as physical feelings throughout the body.

      "abstract": "Torture aims to destroy its victim through the strategic and intentional use of pain to damage the physical, social, and psychological integrity of the individual. A core issue is the resulting multifaceted presentation of somatic, psychological and social problems in the same individual, leading to severe functional limitations and participation restrictions. Chronic pain considers one from the highest symptoms for torture survivors. This literature review of 25 studies will focus on the neurophysiology, and sensitivity of the nervous system after experiencing torture, the changes that happened at the brain level, and the pain system from a neuroscience point of view, and then the study will highlight the evidence-based practice for biopsychosocial intervention for torture survivors in treating chronic pain. The study findings and conclusion show that torture causes noticeable alterations to the brain and nervous system that manifest in the survivors as high PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, feelings of disempowerment, lack of control, personal boundaries being destroyed, or stress, with intermittent or continuous physiological hyperarousal. The classic fight-or-flight response to a perceived threat is a reflexive nervous phenomenon that has obvious survival advantages in evolutionary terms. When a person experiences severe circumstances like torture, which is often accompanied by intense fear, horror, and helplessness, the systems that organize the constellation of reflexive survival behaviors become dysregulated and hypersensitive like critical anatomical and neurophysiological alteration and chronic changes in the pain system, so, it’s mandatory for the rehabilitation team to understand these changes and create a setting that takes into consideration these experiences. Research on chronic pain aims to understand the various risks and protective influences of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that are known to contribute to chronic pain disorders after torture.",

Usually it is of a minor nature (such as a headache or muscle strain) and improves quickly without pharmacological intervention. Rarely it is severe, usually following injury or after a surgical operation, and intensive pharmacological efforts may be needed to relieve the pain and distress. Thus we are all familiar with what pain is. In scientific terms pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage., or described in terms of such damage’. A painful stimulus is a protective response for the individual. Those with diminished or altered pain sensitivity may sustain severe joint injury and deformity or other tissue damage like burns because of the lack of pain sensation.",

      "abstract": "Pain used to be a simple issue. It was caused by physical injury or disease and the sufferer had to rest and take opium. That was about two hundred years ago. A few scattered commentators from Jeremiah (Lamentations I:12-13) to Montaigne (1) had the idea that emotion could cause pain or influence it. The development of anatomical knowledge, closely followed by physiology and then pathology, produced a dilemma. There were many pains that could not be explained by the most modern physical methods of the nineteenth century. Hodgkiss (2) has tersely labelled the problem as \"pain without lesion\". The nineteenth century solution lay in a diagnosis of hysteria.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "abstract": "Diagnosis in psychiatry is not based on a deep understanding of disease mechanisms. Rather, it is a practical way of classifying what clinicians can observe and what patients can describe. Attempts to root diagnosis in neuroscience have all, up to now, failed. There are also no reliable biomarkers or genetic markers for mental disorders. Psychiatric categories can be overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, but overdiagnosis is the more serious problem. The most frequently overdiagnosed categories these days are bipolar disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic disorder. A history of changes in the diagnosis of schizophrenia is presented to illustrate some of these problems.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

Since the true cause of insanity is largely within the individual, is part and parcel of his mental makeup, depends relatively little on the mere accidents of his external life, his environment, and much on his ancestral history, and since the exciting causes merely give opportunity for insanity to arise, any mental abnormality occurring during the developmental period is of importance, however trifling it may seem in itself, as indicating mental instability or a tendency toward deviation from the normal, which under proper education may be corrected, but which if left uncorrected will certainly lead to disaster in the future.

      "abstract": "Abstract The human brain, the only organ capable of studying itself, has in the last century turned its attention toward the mysterious phenomenon of depersonalization, examining it from many perspectives. Depersonalization disorder (DPD) remains one of the most frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed conditions in modern psychiatry. Why? Likely for several reasons. DPD is often accompanied by anxiety, depression, or other disorders, and patients may have trouble or hesitation expressing its vagaries in words that anyone but fellow sufferers can understand. Patients often wind up being treated for depression or anxiety, even though they have tried to make clear that they were depressed or anxious only initially in their depersonalization course, or only well after depersonalization had set in. The patients are often clear that what they are struggling most with are feelings of “unreality,” “deadness,” or “no self” and that they know the difference from being solely depressed or anxious. Clinicians, however, do not always agree, possibly because they have solid training in—and are more comfortable dealing with—the domains of anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

Yet toxic factors, intoxications, undoubtedly cause acute or subacute nervous disorders, which always exhibit definite histopathologic features but only occasionally possess a suggestive clinical picture.

      "abstract": "Verzuimbegeleiding voorbij de terugkeer naar werk De begeleiding van medewerkers die vanwege ziekte hun werk verzuimen is een belangrijke taak voor de bedrijfsarts. Een eenzijdige focus op snelle terugkeer naar werk brengt het risico met zich mee dat zieke medewerkers hervatten voordat ze voldoende hersteld zijn. Dit kan zich uiten in een niet duurzame werkhervatting, of in verminderd functioneren in het werk na de werkhervatting. Dit is tot nu toe weinig onderzocht. Een andere nog weinig onderzochte ongunstige uitkomst is baanverlies tijdens het verzuim. Dit proefschrift richt zich op vier verschillende uitkomstmaten van verzuimbegeleiding, zoals duur tot aan werkhervatting, baanverlies tijdens verzuim, de duurzaamheid van de werkhervatting en het functioneren na werkhervatting, en de factoren die daarmee geassocieerd zijn. Daarbij is gebruik gemaakt van gegevens zoals die door bedrijfsartsen en werkgevers routinematig worden vastgelegd. Psychische klachten gaan vaker dan andere klachten samen met langdurig verzuim, een grotere kans op baanverlies tijdens verzuim en minder functioneren in het jaar na de werkhervatting, maar psychische klachten komen niet vaker terug dan andere klachten. Een gebrek aan ondersteuning door de leidinggevende kan samengaan met een grotere kans op baanverlies en op nieuw verzuim door dezelfde diagnose. Medewerkers die zichzelf als gezond beschouwen geven aan dat hun functioneren in het werk na werkhervatting ook beter is. Duurzame inzetbaarheid na langdurig verzuim is niet vanzelfsprekend. Met het oog op een verouderende beroepsbevolking, waarin steeds meer mensen een chronische aandoening zullen hebben, moeten bedrijfsartsen hun aandacht verleggen van begeleiding naar werkhervatting naar het verbeteren van duurzame inzetbaarheid",

A brief history identifying the key sources of a patient’s anxiety is invaluable for developing a quick psychiatric differential, assessing suicide risk, and ascertaining the need for further treatment. This chapter reviews common anxiety syndromes, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and adjustment disorders related to medical illness. The effects of trauma, including acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are also reviewed for their complex impacts on patients’ care.",

El tratamiento eficaz del dolor postquirúrgico es hoy un reto para los anestesistas, reumatólogos, traumatólogos, cirujanos e investigadores de diversas especialidades. El dolor agudo es una respuesta fisiológica ante un estímulo adverso (mecánico, térmico o químico), asociada a cirugía, traumatismos o enfermedad aguda. Cesa cuando lo hace la causa que lo ocasionó ?, comportándose como un signo de alarma. El dolor crónico resulta del que excede a un problema agudo, manifestándose más allá del fin biológico de defensa. No resulta útil como síntoma de alerta. Su permanencia temporal persistente o episódico que dura 3 meses o más. Los bloqueos nerviosos pueden realizarse con fines diagnósticos, pronósticos y terapéuticos, o una combinación de los mismos, los abordados son: diagnósticos, pronósticos y terapéuticos. Las técnicas intervencionistas son un conjunto variado de procedimientos médicos que se ponen en práctica en las Unidades del Dolor. El objetivo de estas técnicas es suprimir o reducir las señales de dolor del sistema nervioso mediante la inyección de fármacos, infiltraciones, bloqueos mediante radiofrecuencia pulsada o convencional de las raíces nerviosas o con impulsos eléctricos que reducen la sensación de dolor mediante la implante de un neuro estimulador convencional o de alta frecuencia. Las técnicas intervencionistas para tratamiento del dolor crónico: administración epidural de esteroides, tratamiento con radiofrecuencia, epiduroscopia, neuro estimulación peridural y bombas implantables. El tratamiento del dolor agudo debe actuar sobre la causa y, además, en la mayoría de los casos serán necesarios fármacos para aliviar el dolor: antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, opioides, morfina y coadyudantes para aliviar el dolor, solos o asociados con analgésicos, o que tratan síntomas que lo acompañan, como el insomnio, la ansiedad y la depresión.

      "abstract": "Introducción: Ciertos sectores económicos en pandemia establecieron el decremento de la carga física de los trabajadores, relacionadas con sus tareas de carácter manual; éstas a la vez, fueron reemplazadas por el incremento permanente de actividades vinculadas a funciones cognitivas y psicosociales que se corresponden íntimamente a la carga mental, que se constituye en uno de los factores de mayor influencia para el riesgo laboral y adquiere gran interés, esencialmente por las nuevas formas de organización del trabajo; así como también, los avances tecnológicos e informáticos, que demandan de mayores esfuerzos cognoscitivos e intelectuales. La carga mental genera tensiones en el trabajador, provocadas por distintas variables concernientes a los requerimientos laborales; dada la relación que se produce entre éstas y las capacidades mentales o recursos propios de la persona para afrontarlas, junto con los procesos cognitivos y aspectos afectivos del individuo.Se han descrito efectos en la salud y ciertos componentes de riesgo mental se expresan como síntomas depresivos y estrés, afines con otros elementos específicos de las profesiones como: agotamiento, cansancio físico y fatiga generalizada, lesiones musculares, perturbación del sueño y exposición a situaciones y comportamientos de violencia en el contexto laboral. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), ha reconocido que el bienestar de los trabajadores, no solo se condiciona por peligros en el lugar de trabajo, sino también por factores sociales e individuales. Las consecuencias que surgen a raíz de los intentos por superar las condiciones precarias que enfrenta el trabajador, llevan a una connotación negativa de las cargas físicas, psíquicas y fisiológicas, que a futuro se manifiestan en cargas mentales excesivas difíciles de manejar lo que genera un decrecimiento en la productividad. En Ecuador, las políticas públicas, no han considerado aún la salud mental como parte de la salud pública; de ahí, la necesidad de iniciar su discusión, análisis y propuesta.Objetivo: El estudio tiene como propósito fundamental determinar los factores asociados a la carga mental de los docentes de diferentes niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico, conforme a la normativa vigente ecuatoriana.Materiales y Métodos: Se aplicó una metodología con enfoque cuantitativo. Fue aplicado el cuestionario CarMen-Q que evalúa cuatro dimensiones de carga mental: dimensión cognitiva, temporales, requisitos de desempeño y aspectos emocionales. Consta de 29 ítems, con un formato de respuesta mediante Escala Likert. El instrumento se aplicó en línea a 111 docentes de Ecuador de niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico. Para analizar los resultados se recurrió a técnicas estadísticas multivariantes como Análisis de Componentes Principales y estadística descriptiva para análisis de los datos socio demográficos.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren que los factores asociados a la carga mental, se relacionan con la gestión de información, la dimensión emocional, carga laboral y la presión por rendimiento, al que deben responder en este caso los docentes de las instituciones educativas investigados.Conclusiones: Los docentes enfrentan dificultades para responder a las demandas de las tareas. Estas, están directamente relacionadas con las dimensiones cognitivas, de rendimiento y temporales, sin dejar de lado, aquellas vinculadas con la subjetividad humana como corresponde a las emociones, sentimientos y vivencias, más aún cuando el ejercicio de la docencia involucra la interacción directa entre seres humanos.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience that is influenced by genetics, gender, social, cultural and personal parameters. Opposed to chronic pain, which by definition has to last for at least 3 months, acute pain is mostly because of trauma, acute medical conditions or treatment. The link between mood disorders and acute pain has proven to be increasingly significant since the link is bi-directional, and both act as risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety are associated with increased perception of pain severity, whereas prolonged duration of acute pain leads to increased mood dysregulation. Although both depression and anxiety have a proven association with acute pain, the link between depression and acute pain is more thoroughly studied. Pain can be the presenting or sole complaint in depressed patients who present to primary care practices and is often overlooked by clinicians. However, reports on the perception of experimentally-induced pain in depressed patients are mixed, showing both an increased and decreased pain threshold and pain tolerance across various studies. Although less data is published about anxiety and pain, the relationship is consistent across studies as increased anxiety leads to increased severity of pain perceived and decreased pain tolerance. Anxiety as well as fear, stress, and catastrophizing are also shown to be mediators in the causal pathway between pain and disability.",

Schlusselworter: Angststorung, Panikstorung, generalisierte Angststorung, Phobie, Amygdala, Hippokampus, Lerntheorie Abstract: Diagnosis and Genesis of Anxi- ety Disorders. Fears are part of the basal be- havioral repertoire of humans. Accordingly, we find already in reflex-related behavior patterns known as the flight reaction symptoms of anxiety for behavior control. In anxiety disor- ders, anxiety loses its initial function of fear and warning. The intensity or duration of anxi- ety symptoms is no longer appropriate to the situation. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders. They are di- vided into different subgroups. This is done for pragmatic reasons under different therapeutic indications, in some cases underlying func- tional areas can be identified. Directed anxi- ety disorders (phobias) are distinguished from non-directed anxiety disorders. The distinc- tion between a short-duration (phasic) and a long-lasting (tonic) response is the basis for the separation of panic disorder from generalized anxiety disorder. Pathophysiological models on the neurobiological level and in the field of learning theories can help understand the ori- gin and course of anxiety disorders well. The prevention of anxiety disorders seems to be im- portant and even more expandable. Particular forms of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and/or their combination are mentioned. Depending on the diagnosis, dura- tion, and comorbidity, the appropriate form of therapy can be chosen. J Neurol Neurochir Psychiatr 2011; 12 (4): 336-42.",

      "title": "The spectrum of mood disorders.",
      "abstract": "The problem of classifying mood disorders still lacks an acceptable solution. Interrater reliability studies have shown that this problem is more prevalent in mood disorders compared with other psychiatric conditions. Historically the problem originates from the distinction between Geisteskrankheiten and Gemütskrankheiten (mental and mood disorders) because the domain covered by the word mood has been progressively reduced. The fact that neurotic disorders are \"emotional disorders\" further complicates this field. The words anxiety and depression refer to a disorder, to a symptom, and to everyday feelings. A failure or difficulty in the distinction between these three meanings leads to nosological confusion. In recent years, the notion of a spectrum of mood disorders has gained acceptance. According to this, the diverse disorders are placed on a point that is more or less close to one of the extremes. Something similar occurs in the unipolar-bipolar distinction, in which the bipolar II or atypical and bipolar III occupy a central place on the spectrum. Cluster analysis and other mathematical techniques have helped to clarify the outlook, but there is a need for a biopsychosocial perspective and for a deeper understanding of the natural history of these disorders.",

Some clues in the history are sudden onset, intermittent time course, variability of manifestation over time, childhood trauma, and history of other somatic symptoms. Anxiety and depression are common, but not necessarily more than in the general population. Although there are no tests currently capable of demonstrating whether symptoms are willfully produced, there may not be a clear categorical difference between voluntary and involuntary symptoms. The prognosis of an FND is linked to early diagnosis and symptom duration, but unfortunately, the majority of the patients are diagnosed after considerable delays.A positive diagnosis of FNDs can be made on the basis of history and neurological signs without reliance on psychological stressors. Past sensitizing events and neurobiological abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of FNDs.

      "title": "Pain Syndromes and Disorders of Sensation",
      "abstract": "Although routine clinical neurological examination generally does not reveal any abnormality of sensation in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), subjective sensory symptoms are quite frequently present, and objective abnormalities of proprioceptive function and sensorimotor integration have been demonstrated with sophisticated testing. Primary sensory symptoms of PD may include paresthesias of varied descriptions (numbness, tingling, and burning). Painful symptoms in PD can be classified into five categories: musculoskeletal pain, radicular or neuropathic pain, dystonia-related pain, primary (central) pain, and akathitic discomfort. Musculoskeletal pain in the form of shoulder stiffness frequently develops in persons with PD, often preceding the development of more classic motor features of the condition. Spinal deformities and painful contractures may also complicate the clinical picture in individuals with PD. The postural PD deformities may predispose to the development of compressive radiculopathy and sciatica. Dystonic spasms are among the most painful symptoms that a patient with PD may experience. Dystonia most often appears as an \" off\" phenomenon, but medication-induced dystonia may also occur. Primary or central pain is generated within the brain itself and is commonly characterized by bizarre, disagreeable painful sensations that are resistant to treatment. Parkinsonian akathisia is characterized by subjective inner restlessness that manifests as a constant need to move or change position, typically during \"off\" periods. The recognition and differentiation of parkinsonian pain from pain owing to other coincident medical conditions is vitally important for the effective diagnosis and treatment of pain in PD.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings and physical well-being which lasts minimum for 2 weeks. Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

      "abstract": "Summary At least 1.4 million people die, or receive hospital or emergency care every year in the United States as a result of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many more are treated in other settings or receive no treatment at all. Thus TBI is often unidentified, with subsequent cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physical sequelae that are not linked to the injury. Yet, over 5.3 million Americans live with TBI-related disabilities that interfere with their overall performance and social roles within the community. Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in developed countries. Damage caused by focal and diffuse lesions produces symptoms involving most major medical systems as well as symptoms of neuro-logical and psychological origin. Recent published articles on emotional and behavioural consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are reviewed. The ranges of clinical problems reviewed include depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as the TBI animal model.",

It then becomes necessary to determine whether this symptom is indeed secondary to some other problem of a situational, developmental, or psychiatric nature, or whether any associated emotional distress is secondary to study difficulties deriving from poor study habits. In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants. The diagnostic and remedial needs of students with such problems are therefore best served by a clinic which involves psychiatrists and psychologists working in close collaboration.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

Selection processes lead to increased rates of psychological illness in general practice and in specialist practice. The phys-ical distress of FMS can increase both anxiety and depression. Questionable research supported by the insurance industry has tended to provide nega-tive and disparaging views of pain. Current imag-ing studies support the view that central effects connected with FMS relate to the processing of noxious stimulation more than affective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

A number of experiments are described which show that biochemical, physiological and/or pathological changes in an organism do not seem to be caused by the aversive or noxious nature of the stressor but by the ability or inability of the organism to deal with this stressor. If an individual can cope successfully with the environmental challenge, little or no stress is experienced, the challenge is viewed as only minimal stressful and no major health consequences seem to arise. If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise. Thus, coping strategies available to and employed by an individual will determine whether or not stress is experienced, whether or not an event becomes stressful and whether or not pathological consequences will occur.",

It disrespects boundaries, interrupts all kinds of units and makes them blend, it disturbs bodily and psychic organisms and upsets social and historical organization. Some characteristics of the history of trauma have their origin in this situation. One of them is the gradual extension for instance of the notion of 'trauma' which makes the surgical 'wound' (greek: trauma) evolve into a bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Other characteristics of the history of trauma are its association with questions of endogenous versus exogenous causes of suffering and with the issue of guilt and its recurrent falling into oblivion. The paper traces the history of traumatogenic illness from the simple wound to forensically important damages like the 'railway-injuries' entitling to claims for damages, to 'traumatic-' and 'war-neuroses' and finally to the more or less endemic 'posttraumatic stress syndrome' of present time.",

SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant younger than age 1 year that cannot be explained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy, scene investigation, and clinical history. Despite research and advances in understanding of SIDS, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out accidental causes such as suffocation/strangulation and cardiac, infectious, metabolic, or traumatic etiologies. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, a working model of SIDS includes a combination of exogenous factors, such as overbundling, prone sleep position, and airway obstruction, and intrinsic factors such as immature cardiorespiratory or arousal systems.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (mdd) can be elicited by various kinds of stress, such as negative life events, chronic stress and experiences of abuse early in life. These stressors interact with personality traits and with a genetic predisposition to depression, thereby bringing about mdd. Therefore, the neurobiology of depression cannot be separated from the neurobiology of stress system. A substantial number of publications have in fact demonstrated that mdd patients show abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which is a key element of the stress response. Such disturbances are exacerbated by chronic stress, early experiences of abuse and even prenatal exposure to stress. On the other hand, genetic variations can play a role in the hpa axis dysfunction and in vulnerability to depression. Evidence is emerging that certain genes are directly involved in the functioning of the hpa axis. Other genetic factors, not directly related to the hpa axis, are probably relevant as well, the best known example being the serotonin transporter gene.",

No injury to the teeth from external causes, and no injury to the dental pulp from constitutional causes ever repairs itself. That is, should a tooth be broken or decayed it can never be restored by natural means, or should a pulp nodule or dentinal tumor form within the pulp from constitutional causes it will never be absorbed.

Many proposed diagnostic workups trying to avoid the challenge of considering all possible etiologies by early commitment to a specific area of the spine (i.e., neck or lower back). Others limit the differential diagnoses by pursuing a rational but limited goal, like ruling out conditions that may result in disability or death in the setting of an emergency department. We have briefly described a long list of medical conditions, each of which may present as back or neck pain, and whose prevalence ranges from common to very rare. We then showed that they all can be assigned to one of 7 groups according to judicious history taking, physical examination and simple imaging and laboratory tests: (1) pain that radiates from the cranium, chest or abdomen; (2) pain with signs of infection; (3) pain with signs of nerve root compression; (4) pain with signs of cord or cauda compression; (5) mechanical pain; (6) rheumatic pain; (7) pain with other characteristics, with or without local tenderness. Further referral to diagnostic tests and specialist consultations after initial assignment to one of these seven categories would save the patient time and unnecessary tests. We believe that this review and the proposed diagnostic algorithm may be valuable for medical education and for application in the primary care setting for the purpose of conducting a diagnostic workup of any type of back or neck pain in all patient groups and may be possibly used for development of diagnostic software and machine learning.",

      "title": "Focused Neuroregulation in the Treatment and Prevention of Mental and Physical Illness",
      "abstract": "Despite the enormous strides that have been made in neuroscience, the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Consequently, various forms of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and neuromodulatory therapy continue to be applied without a clear understanding of what pathological process is being treated. However, an emerging hypothesis contends that psychiatric symptoms are the consequence of pathological hyperactivity in symptom-related circuits in the brain. According to the Multi-Circuit Neuronal Hyperexcitability (MCNH) Hypothesis of Psychiatric Disorders, persistent firing in anxiety circuits causes persistent feelings of anxiety; persistent firing in depressive circuits causes persistent feelings of depression; persistent firing in cognitive circuits causes ruminative and obsessive thoughts; etc… This pathological circuit-specific hyperactivity is believed to be caused by an inherent failure of the neurological system to self-regulate when perturbed by a psychological, emotional, or biological stressor. Based on this hypothesis, it would not be unreasonable to think that psychiatric symptoms, irrespective of which disorder was being treated, would respond favorably to any natural or medicinal intervention that reduces the excitability of the neurological system. Although the use of brain-calming drugs in psychiatry is not new, what is new is the idea of focusing their use on correcting a specific physiological abnormality that is believed to underlie the symptoms. This technique, which could be called “Focused Neuroregulation,” would differ from standard pharmacotherapy in that if one anticonvulsant failed to alleviate or only partially alleviated symptoms, another anticonvulsant would be substituted or added rather than turning to an off-target class of drugs. This approach is clinically valid because each anticonvulsant is structurally different, and there are multiple mechanisms (and receptors) through which the excitability of the neurological system can be therapeutically regulated. Also, anticonvulsants, unlike other classes of psychotropic drugs, tend to bring the system back into balance; hence the term “mood stabilizers.” Yet another benefit of Focused Neuroregulation is that it could help prevent or slow the progression of the many chronic health conditions that have been linked to an inherent hyperexcitability of the neurological system. In recognition of these potential benefits, and in an effort to avoid the many problems that are associated with the symptom-based treatment of psychiatric and related functional symptoms, the aim of this article is to incentivize the study of a more targeted approach to the treatment of mental illness and the prevention of chronic disease.",

In today’s world, when fast pace of living and exposure to different risks is a common thing, people are more and more exposed to traumatic events and experiences, either as victims or witnesses of violence which can lead to development of post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\nA little more than twenty years ago Croatian history was marked by war and, although it finished, Croatia today is still facing its consequences, one of which is a large number of people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder that occurs since the beginning of the civilization, but only to be defined about thirty years ago. Post-traumatic stress disorder, like many other psychiatric disorders, affects not only the patient but also his family and his wider social surroundings. Over the time, the symptoms of the disorder progress and the disorder itself becomes chronic. Consequently, the patient’s ability to function in everyday life and work environment drops, and it only shows how important the early detection, treatment and prevention are for a patient. Post-traumatic stress disorder treatments involve pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and other psychotherapies. The role of a nurse covers a wide spectrum of necessary abilities, when it comes to patients who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. From appropriate communication skills up to complex processes of nurse care required for that type of patient. Taking care of patients who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder requires a great amount of knowledge, patience and empathy.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important.

They may be diagnosed in either the presence or absence of individual mental disorders. In some cases, relational problems may interact with genetic vulnerabilities in contributing to the development of psychopathology. Four major constructs have been investigated that describe nodal areas of relational difficulty in the family and marital environment: structure, communication, expression of affect, and problem solving. Relational problems are best observed and treated directly in a family format in which the conflicted family members are present with the therapist. Genetics, neuroimaging, and family studies are important vehicles for deciphering how interpersonal relationships affect the etiology of both physical and mental disorders.",

Even expressions of a more conservative attitude concede, with some consistency, a connection between cerebral function and certain visceral ailments, prominent among which are peptic ulcer, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. Speculation concerning possible relationship between cause and effect in such instances has resulted principally from clinical analysis of these disorders, particularly from the results of therapeutic attack on the autonomic nervous system in patients suffering from them. For obvious reasons, examination of psychosomatic disorders in experimental animals is extremely difficult.

Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts.

A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors.

We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias.

Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico.

It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

However, over recent years the scientific concept of postnatal depression has been challenged by studies suggesting no increased risk of depression at this time and little difference in the clinical presentation, response to treatment or prognosis of depression presenting in the postpartum and non-postpartum period. In the case of bipolar disorder (manic depression), however, there is compelling evidence that the postpartum is a period of very high risk and evidence is emerging to suggest that, for at least a proportion of women with major depression, there is a specific relationship to a childbirth related trigger. The author will consider some of the lines of evidence pointing to a specific relationship between childbirth and mood disorders and argue that this link is an important clue that can inform understanding, not only of postpartum mood disorders, but of affective disorders in general.",

Sympathetically maintained pain is a frequent but variable component of these syndromes, as the sympathetic and somatosensory pathways are no longer functionally distinct. Pain is the cardinal feature of CRPS, but the constellation of symptoms and signs may also include sensory changes, autonomic dysfunction, trophic changes, motor impairment and psychological changes. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, with additional information regarding the presence of sympathetically maintained pain or autonomic dysfunction being provided by carefully performed and interpreted supplemental tests. Clinical experience supports early intervention with sympatholytic procedures (pharmacological or nerve block techniques), but further scientific data is required to confirm the appropriate timing and relative efficacy of different procedures. Patients with recurrent or refractory symptoms are best managed in a multi-disciplinary pain clinic as more invasive and intensive treatment will be required to minimize ongoing pain and disability.",

Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "title": "Genocidal trauma",
      "abstract": "In accordance with the medical, 'lesion'-oriented trauma concept, literature on psychic trauma and its consequences tends to concentrate on posttraumatic clinical symptomatology, regardless of the type of trauma exposure. Only a minority of studies either draws on stressor-specific psychological symptoms or calls for a taxonomy of traumatic experiences. With regard to the specificity of genocidal traumatization and persecution of ethnic groups, there is much clinical, but relatively little epidemiological evidence. Recent studies tend to investigate the neurobiological more than the social conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and therapeutic efforts are prone to concentrate on coping with trauma rather than addressing and understanding it. As an outcome of this short review of the very different notions and implications of the trauma concept in different discourses and paradigms, it can be stated that the specific nature of the traumatic situation seems to play a marginal role in clinical as well as in sociological discourse.",

One type of self-reported posttraumatic illness known as chemosensory dysfunction occurs in as many as 24.5% of head trauma victims. Ferreting out individuals pretending to have chemosensory dysfunction as part of litigation for economic gain is a clinical dilemma requiring a multimodal approach. This includes evaluation of historical context, complaints, physical examination findings, chemosensory testing, psychiatric evaluation, and ancillary testing. Long-standing chemosensory complaints seemingly produce or exacerbate psychiatric problems in various ways. As chemosensory problems persist over time, patients may become pessimistic about an eventual recovery and this may lead to depression. Historical clues indicating malingering also include complaints of trauma-induced absolute loss of chemosensory ability. Consistent with his physical findings, both first taste and temporal summation indicate problems within the chemosensory system.",

With modern methods of diagnosis pain, which is a purely subjective phenomenon, can almost be classed as an objective symptom. Often, for example, pressure might elicit pain, or movement might produce it; regardless of the stimulation, the questions of the precise nature of the pain, where and at what times experienced, are important factors, and however subjective the pain might be from the standpoint of the patient, its interpretation always presents to the physician a problem in objective diagnosis. The experience of roentgenologists shows that the severity, persistence or total absence of pain are often at variance with the magnitude of the disease; also that many combinations or complications exist. Roentgen-ray diagnosis often assists in explaining the cause of pain because it reduces the intangible to the tangible. Pain",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a frequent clinical condition that notably raises the hospital morbidity. It generally coexists with a wide range of mental and cognitive symptoms and has a diverse clinical course. Agitation is a state of extreme restlessness or irritability including excessive muscular activity accompanied by a sense of inner strain and exceeding restlessness associated with mental discomfort. It occurs frequently in psychiatric units, emergency rooms, and nursing care homes, and is a common condition experienced by the patients especially of neuropsychiatric diseases. Agitation is the third most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptom in dementia, behind apathy and depression, with an overall approximate prevalence of 30%. Agitation has variable prevalence as per the diseases. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the etiology, epidemiology and common disorders associated with agitation. Trauma particularly to the head, widespread infection, sepsis, dementia, delirium, exposure to toxins, electrolyte imbalances, endocrine abnormalities, and a post-ictal state is one of the risk factors for agitation. Agitation prevalence varies between 30% and 50% in Alzheimer's disease, accounts for 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia, as per the various studies. Agitation is a broad category of unrelated behaviours that frequently changes course and is visible in a range of clinical settings. Several underlying pathophysiologic conditions are mediated by dysregulations of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and GABAergic systems. Further research will be helpful in defining new management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

The disorders are caused by physical and/or psycho-social circumstances. In treating the different forms of stress disorders, physical activity has been utilised with good results.

Numerous clinical, neurobiological, psycho physiological and MR volumetric studies indicate many uncertainties related to PTSD. About psychotic PTSD is more frequently discussed and written. Whether PTSD is or its symptoms or complications during periods of decompensation may have the character of the psychosis and the psychosis within PTSD or a co-morbid diagnosis?

An important aspect of pain is nociception, a complex series of electrochemical events that involves activation of specialized neural pathways in response to (potentially) tissue-damaging stimuli. Clinically, the degree of nociception is manifested as signs of tissue damage. Pain, in contrast to nociception, is a subjective experience that may involve stimulus-induced activation of afferent neural pathways or other components, such as somatosensory processing or psychosocial factors. Reflex responses to nociceptive stimulation can be described as suprasegmental or cortical and spinal or segmental. Spinal reflexes are generated by nociceptive signals being transmitted through the dorsal horn to somatomotor or autonomic neurons at various spinal levels, resulting in responses such as paralytic ileus, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, or muscle spasm. Suprasegmental reflexes are propagated via the ascending pathways to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and cortex, where withdrawal reflexes and autonomic responses are generated.",

It has a protective role because it protects the body from damage and helps to maintain organ function, the organism as a whole. Pain is one of the world's health problems, the most common causes of pain are injury, surgery, malignancy, and hormonal disorders. Delineation of pain is to: physical, mental and physical psychogenic caused. Physical pain is a symptom for which patients most often asked for medical help, the pain is a warning mechanism to inform that there is a tissue injury or dysfunction of individual organs. Mental pain and suffering often called. It is a state of deep sadness often associated with fear, anxiety and other negative emotions that occur after someone, for the individual, irreparable and significant loss. The relationship between pain and injury is not simple, that is possible: injury without pain, without injury, pain disproportionate to the severity of injury, pain after healing of injuries. Injuries without pain - some people are born without sensitivity to pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as analgesia. Pain without injury - common in so-called. psychogenic pain where the pain occurs after mental tension and where there are no organic damage. Pain disproportionate the difficulty of injury- may occur in insignificant physical processes that do not have great physical significance for the total health of the individual, and cause very severe pain. The pain after healing injury - very common after injuring nerves and known examples of such pain are phantom pain and causalgia. Causalgia is very severe pain, burning type that occurs because of injury of damage causing their peripheral sensory nerves. Phantom pain is common in people who are missing the lower part of the body (leg, hand, and breast). Patients feel pain in a body part that they amputated therefore no longer exists, and so clearly perceived the pain that they feel that the body is still there. In addition to causing health, physical and mental difficulties, pain significantly affects the economic situation of the individual and society at large, so big attention should be paid to its prevention and cure. The doctor's obligation is to disclose the cause of pain and mitigate / eliminate pain. Access to treatment of chronic pain, sometimes acute, is multidisciplinary and should be administered pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (physical therapy, TENS, ultrasound, laser, exercise, heat and cold), and sometimes pain treatment methods (acupuncture, chiropractic and other) . While there has been great progress in the treatment of chronic pain, many patients are still suffering because of poor pain assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Biological aspects of depression after brain injury, in particular traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, are reviewed. Symptoms of depression after brain injury are found to be rather non-specific with no good evidence of a clear pattern distinguishing it from depression in those without brain injury. Nevertheless symptoms of disturbances of interest and concentration are particularly prevalent, and guilt is less evident. Variabilitiy of mood is characteristic. The prevalence of depression is similar after both stroke and TBI with the order of 20-40% affected at any point in time in the first year, and about 50% of people experience depression at some stage. There is no good evidence for areas of specific vulnerability in terms of lesion location, and early suggestions of a specific association with injury to the left hemisphere have not been confirmed. Insight appears to be related to depressed mood with studies of TBI indicating that greater insight over time post-injury may be associated with greater depression. We consider that this relationship may be due to depression appearing as people gain more awareness of their disability, but also suggest that changes in mood may result in altered awareness. The risk of suicide after TBI is reviewed. There appears to be about a three to fourfold increased risk of suicide after TBI, although much of this increased risk may be due to pre-injury factors in terms of the characteristics of people who suffer TBI. About 1% of people who have suffered TBI will commit suicide over a 15-year follow-up. Drug management of depression is reviewed. There is little specific evidence to guide the choice of antidepressant medication and most psychiatrists would start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is important that the drug management of depression after brain injury is part of a full package of care that can address biological as well as psychosocial factors in management.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapidly developing clinical symptoms and/or signs of focal, and at times\r\nglobal, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause\r\nother than that of vascular origin according to World Health Organization definition. Currently, stroke is ranked at number five killers among Malaysian population as reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Thus, this mini review paper will highlight the trending in multidisciplinary research for stroke disease management throughout the different era. This is an important aspect to be understood further to fill in the knowledge gap for current research needs.",

The trauma is defined as a situation involving actual or threatened injury or death, and the survivor feels helpless, horrified, or terrified during the experience. Such traumatic life events, especially sexual and criminal assault, are unfortunately extremely common. It has been estimated that approximately one quarter of trauma survivors suffer from PTSD at some point in their lives. Women appear to be more likely than men to develop PTSD following trauma.",

      "abstract": "Chronic illness lasts. A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "title": "Spiritual Emergency: The Understanding and Treatment of Transpersonal Crises",
      "abstract": "The Concept of Spiritual Emergency T here exists increasing evidence that many individuals experiencing episodes of nonordinary states of consciousness accompanied by various emotional, perceptual, and psychosomatic manifestations are undergoing an evolutionary crisis rather than suffering from a mental disease (Grof, 1985).The recognition of this fact has important practical and theoretical consequences.If properly understood and treated as difficult stages in a natural developmental process, these experiences-spiritual emergencies or transpersonal crises-can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, creative problem-solving, personality transformation, and consciousness evolution.This fact is reflected in the term \"spiritual emergency,\" which suggests a crisis, but also suggests the potential for rising to a higher state of being.Traditional psychiatry does not recognize the difference between mystical and psychotic experiences.All unusual states of consciousness are essentially seen as pathological and attributed to anatomical, physiological, and biochemical changes in the brain, or other medical causes.There is no acknowledgement that any dramatic experiential states involving changes of consciousness could be potentially therapeutic and transformative.Psychiatry thus routinely and indiscriminately uses controlling and suppressive approaches to terminate such experiences.However, in the case of transpersonal crises, insensitive use of repressive measures can lead to chronicity and long-term dependence on tranquillizing medication or other pharmaceuticals with ensuing serious side effects and impoverishment of personality.It seems, therefore, extremely important to clarify theoretically the concept of transpersonal crises and to develop comprehensive and effective approaches to their treatment.Spiritual emergencies (transpersonal crises) can occur spontaneously without any precipitating factors, or they can be triggered by emotional stress, physical exertion, disease, accident, intense sexual experience, childbirth, or exposure to psychedelic drugs.However, in many instances the catalyzing factor seems to be involvement in various meditative practices which are specifically designed to activate spiritual energies.As spiritual disciplines are gaining popularity in the West, an increasing number of people are experiencing transpersonal crises that can be traced to their practice of yoga, Zen, various movement meditations, pranayama, Kundalini maneuvers, Tibetan Buddhist psychoenergetic exercises, Christian prayer, and other forms of deep and systematic spiritual involvement and self-exploration.Supportive evidence for the concept of spiritual emergency can be drawn from a variety of fields : history, anthropology, comparative religion, clinical psychiatry, modern consciousness research, psychedelic therapy, Jungian psychology, new experiential psychotherapies, and many others.Indirectly, the developments in a variety of scientific disciplines that undermine the Newtonian-Cartesian model of the universe and mechanistic thinking can be used to support the new concepts.Though incompatible with traditional thinking in science, the new approaches are congruent with many important aspects of the emerging paradigm (Grof, 1985). Definition of Spiritual EmergencyT o prevent misunderstanding, it is important to emphasize that not every experience of unusual states of consciousness and intense perceptual, emotional, cognitive, and psychosomatic changes falls into the category of spiritual emergency.The concept of transpersonal crisis is not oriented against traditional psychiatry; it offers an alternative approach to individuals who can benefit from it and are capable and willing to accept it.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

This is particularly true when depressive symptoms are experienced in the setting of coarse brain disease. Here the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and aetiology offer unique challenges to the clinician. The development of broader, more patient centred outcome measures such as quality of life and “health gain” has also elevated the status of depression, particularly because depressive symptoms are now seen to be the primary contributors to morbidity in some neurological illnesses. Two recent studies showed how depressive symptoms accounted for much more of the variance in morbidity in Parkinson’s disease (40%) than did movement disorder (17%).1,2 Critics of these studies could rightly point out that before the advent of L-dopa, motor disorder was definitely the biggest contributor to morbidity in Parkinson’s disease, and that quality of life as a measure is more directly related to mood state …",

Harassment or sexual abuse leads also to a weak physical health. The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

Depersonalization has been reported in epilepsy, after drug ingestion, encephalitis, hysteria, manic depression, and schizophrenia, as well as in various neurotic patients. It has also been noted in normals, but usually after emotional shock or physical exhaustion. Most recently, persistent feelings of depersonalization have been elevated to the status of a diagnostic entity in itself.",

      "abstract": "Syncope in the aviation environment can be a very difficult problem to assess. Even more difficult is the differential diagnosis between convulsive syncope and epilepsy after the first event. This paper discusses syncope in general and the differential diagnosis between vasovagal syncope and other forms of syncope. About 50% of all syncopal episodes cannot be identified as to etiology. However, a benign outcome for a single syncopal episode, non-cardiac in origin, is the norm. The diagnosis of syncope is discussed, emphasizing that a meticulous history from an observer or the patient, a good physical examination, and an ECG are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Other diagnostic venues are discussed. Convulsive syncope occurs in only about 12% of syncopal episodes, 65% of these being vasovagal in origin. The other 35% are due to a variety of causes. We found no good algorithm to differentiate convulsive syncope from epilepsy. We reviewed the literature to develop a differential diagnostic table, focusing on: age, awake status, position, emotional/physiologic stressors, onset, aura, appearance, injury on falling, seizure characteristics, automatism, length of unconsciousness and subsequent confusion, pulse characteristics, blood pressure, urinary incontinence, seizure duration, recovery time post-event, post-seizure sequelae, amnesia, posture vs. recovery, EEG characteristics, and the value of sophisticated diagnostic procedures.",

Pain is the sensation that usually arises when noxious stimulus causes real or potential damage to bodily tissue. The neural encoding and further processing elicited by such stimuli is called nociception. Pain can be essentially divided into two categories: adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protecting organism from injury. Contrary, maladaptive pain is an expression of the pathologic operation of nervous system. Chronic pain in humans has been arbitrarily defined as pain lasting for more than 6 months. It is not only results from prolonged sensitization of nociceptive neurons but also from influence of social and psychological factors.",

      "abstract": "The concept ``psychosomatic'', initially introduced in the first half of this century, has recently being reconfirmed by the theory and practice of modern medicine. The psychosomatic disorders are generally defined as physical (somatic) diseases produced, in part, by psychological factors, primarily stress. The organs of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and endocrine system are being affected, as a result of innervation by the autonomic nervous system. In some of these diseases the psychological factors can play relatively essential role; these are named ``primary psychosomatic diseases'': essential hypertension, peptic ulcer, bronchial asthma, ulcerative colitis, neurodermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and hyperthyroidism (the last two diseases were later replaced by eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia nervosa). In many other cases the psychological element is only one among several parallel factors; these are sometimes called ``secondary psychosomatic diseases''. As known from the psychosomatic medicine, the stressors are being refracted through the individual history of a person as through a prism, leading to a spectrum of possible reactions. The personality prism comprises heredity, early child experiences and actual conflict, while the resulting disorders, as a response of the human being, have the form of neuroses, disturbed behavior and psychoses from one side, and psychophysiological disorders and othermore » psychosomatic diseases, including synergetic amplification, from the other side.

Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together.

Insomnia, hysteria, acute and chronic melancholia, neurasthenia and suicidal mania are a few of the unfortunate complications that may arise following operation on the female pelvis. Permanency of cure in gynecologic cases is frequently determined by the absence of postoperative psychic sequelæ. Frequently, of course, the nature of the pelvic pathologic conditions will obviate any possibility of operative relief of associated, nervous lesions, and the nature of the gynecologic disease may portend continued or exacerbated manifestation of the psychic disturbances.

MUS is a working hypothesis based on the assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated but clinical condition presented by the patient was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear.

Anxiety is the complex blend of unpleasant emotions and cognitions that is both more oriented to the future and much more diffuse than fear (2).Anxiety has not only cognitive components but also physiological and behavioural components. At the cognitive level anxiety involves negative mood worry about the possible future, threat or danger, self-preoccupation and future threat and to control it if it occurs. At the physiological level anxiety often creates a state of tension and chronic over arousal which may affect readiness for delaying with danger. At behavioural level anxiety may create a strong tendency to avoid situations where danger might encounter but there is not the immediate urge to flee with anxiety as there is with fear (3). An increased risk of muscular skeletal disorder was found in workers with pre-existing anxiety and depression compared to the without them (4).",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

The challenge is to individualize the treatment of depression taking account clinical specificities, but also advances in the field of biological and genetic research. Today, intense psychiatric research tries to discover biomarkers to predict treatment response. Because individuals are highly different from a biological, psychological and sociological point of view, more personalized therapeutic approaches are recommended.",

Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting.

L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements.

Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen.

Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex.

      "abstract": "It is only the circumstances enveloping pain which give it meaning by provoking a greater or lesser degree of suffering. In the context of an illness, an accident or a persistent pain, the experience is endured and is almost always a mutilation. The individual is diminished and reduced to a shadow of themselves. By contrast, a pain which is chosen and controlled through personal discipline with the goal of pushing oneself to one’s limits (sport, body art, suspensions, getting a tattoo or a piercing, etc.) contains only a trifling element of suffering, even if it hurts. One merely has to accept a bearable level of discomfort. And the paradox is that, on occasion, recourse to pain is a means of combating suffering, as in the case of teenagers who self-harm.",

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

Poor sleep quality is seen in adults with anxiety disorders such as specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Objective data obtained from polysomnograms support this claim in many instances. Nocturnal panic occurs frequently in patients with sleep apnea and may predispose to the development of panic disorder. Insomnia is a trait marker for depression, and may also be one for anxiety disorders.

Often discussed in the frame of psychiatry, it is also observed in other domains of medicine. It impacts not only patients, but their relatives and their children, as well as the health professionals taking care of them. Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment. It is therefore important to understand its underlying mechanisms in order to fight it more efficiently.La stigmatisation est un phénomène social très commun, basé sur la discrimination d’un individu ou d’un sous-groupe d’individus par un groupe dominant ou majoritaire. Discuté habituellement dans le contexte spécifique de la psychiatrie, ce phénomène existe aussi dans d’autres domaines de la médecine. Il touche non seulement les patients mais également leurs proches, leurs enfants, et parfois les soignants qui s’en occupent. De plus, il nuit à l’implantation de stratégies de prévention, induit des réactions dépressives, une perte d’estime de soi et une détérioration de la qualité de vie chez les patients.

However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible. Chronic muscular pain can be perceived not as a sign representing a symbol of underlying factors but rather as a sign understood as an expression of the bodily state.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Malgre les nombreux progres de la prevention et du traitement medical de l’epilepsie de l’enfant, le taux de troubles psychopathologiques reste stable depuis plus de trente ans.

D’autre part, des troubles du comportement et la depression sont parfois retrouves avant l’apparition d’une epilepsie, ce qui plaide en faveur d’un dysfonctionnement neurobiologique commun a l’epilepsie et aux troubles psychiatriques. L’etude des variables influencant l’apparition de tels troubles montre des resultats contradictoires. Les variables propres a l’epilepsie ne semblent pas influer sur les troubles psychiatriques, sauf par le biais des troubles cognitifs secondaires a l’epilepsie. En revanche, les variables familiales (troubles du fonctionnement familial, depression maternelle plus frequemment retrouves que chez les parents d’enfants temoins), et surtout la perception parentale du controle de l’epilepsie predisent mieux l’ajustement parental que le niveau de controle de l’epilepsie. Tous les auteurs soulignent que malgre ce constat, la prise en charge psychiatrique est notoirement insuffisante.

Tilstanden er vanlig etter ervervet hjerneskade. I artikkelen gis en oversikt over kunnskapsstatus om utmattelse etter hjerneslag og etter traumatiske hjerneskader. KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG En vurdering av eksisterende litteratur, inkludert litteratursøk, samt vår kliniske erfaring ligger til grunn for innholdet i artikkelen. RESULTATER RESULTATER I eksisterende undersøkelser er det brukt varierende definisjoner av tilstanden og det er anvendt ulike kartleggingsverktøy. Forekomsten av utmattelse etter hjerneslag eller traumatisk hjerneskade er usikker på grunn av ulike inklusjonskriterier og kartleggingsmetoder og fordi ulikt måletidspunkt kan gi ulike prevalenstall. I flere arbeider anslås forekomsten til å ligge mellom 50 % og 70 %. Vår kunnskap om de patologiske mekanismene er svært begrenset. Både premorbide, sosiodemografiske, slag-/traumerelaterte og komorbide faktorer spiller inn på hvordan pasienten oppfatter tilstanden. Blant anvendte behandlingstiltak er psykoedukasjon, aktivitetsregulering, fysisk trening og behandling av komorbide tilstander. Det er også gjort forsøk med medikamentell behandling, foreløpig uten overbevisende resultater. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Utmattelse er vanlig hos hjerneslagpasienter og pasienter med traumatiske hjerneskader og begrenser ofte i betydelig grad deres hverdag. Vår viten om patologiske mekanismer og behandlingstiltak er mangelfull, og pasientpopulasjonen er heterogen. Behandlingen er individuelt tilpasset og har som mål at den enkelte skal kunne bruke sin begrensede kapasitet på en mest mulig hensiktsmessig måte.",

Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence.

      "abstract": "In the modern conditions of the development of sports, a great place is given to the impact of stress on the athlete's body. During preparation for competitions of various levels, the Olympic Games, world championships, continental championships, city competitions, athletes are \"accompanied\" by mental and emotional tension. Accordingly, when being in a given state of stress, corresponding negative disturbances appear in the performed sports activity. In general, stress is a fairly common and common phenomenon. Minor stresses are inevitable and harmless, but excessive stress creates problems for both individuals and organizations in accomplishing tasks. Psychologists believe that a person suffers more and more often from insults inflicted on him, a sense of his own insecurity, uncertainty about the future. There are two main groups of stress factors that most significantly affect the results of sports activities and are most often encountered: pre-competitive and competitive. Competitive stressors are stressors related directly to the sporting situation the athlete finds themselves in. Essentially, they are the most obvious stressors and are most directly linked to what happens during training or in a game. Organizational stressors can be attributed to, and therefore solved by, the coaching and organizational set up surrounding a team. The athlete needs to be helped to identify actions aimed at improving performance. Success in reaching sports peaks depends on the individual psychological characteristics of the athlete, and certain types of sports make demands and at the same time form personal qualities that are necessary for successful competitive activities. Each athlete is different, and their response to these competitive stressors will vary too. Finding the sweet spot where these stressors are contributing to an engaged, locked-in mindset can be the difference come crunch time. Knowing when a competitive stressor is overwhelming an athlete and having a detrimental affect can be an important preventative measure to avoid further issues down the road.",

The association of depression and diabetes is well documented and has clinical impact in diabetes treatment's outcome. Patients usually aren't evaluated initially by a psychiatrist, so it is important that non-psychiatrists learn to evaluate major depression and its impact. Major depression can and should be evaluated on a routine clinical assessment. Depression's impact on the patients' quality of life, productivity and social interactions is well documented. The initial diagnosis of depression should lead to its prompt treatment, and it has to be emphasized that the incorrect treatment can lead to worsening of the condition, relapses, recurrences or even chronification of major depression.",

      "title": "Medical Illnesses in Psychiatric Patients — a Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is a high prevalence of physical disorders in psychiatric patients. However, physical disorders often go unrecognised and untreated in routine psychiatric clinical practice. This paper reviews the available literature on the association between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. There is a well-established relationship between major medical disorders and most psychiatric disorders. Early medical diagnosis in psychiatric patients has important clinical significance. Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or occur as side effects of psychotropic medications. It is important that psychiatrists perform adequate clinical examination of their patients in order to recognise and treat the medical disorders. Remedies suggested are adequate training and research, interdepartmental teaching programmes, refresher courses, and active consultation-liaison services in clinical practice. Key words: Anxiety disorders, Comorbidity, Depressive disorder, Schizophrenia Introduction Medical illnesses are more prevalent in psychiatric patients than in the general population. However, these often go unrecognised and untreated in routine clinical psychiatric practice. (1) Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or may occur as side effects of psychotropic medication. Patients suffering from schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders have a higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of exercise. (2) On the other hand, patients with physical disorders are likely to be non-compliant and have higher dropout, morbidity, and mortality rates. Despite the evidence, psychiatrists consider the medical care of their patients to be beyond the scope of their care. They are also reluctant to perform general physical examination of their patients, fearing that this would disrupt the therapeutic relationship. Two-thirds of psychiatrists have never performed physical examination of their patients. According to the available data, a physical examination is performed on only 13% of inpatients and 8% of psychiatric outpatients. (3) This is of increasing concern for mental health professionals in clinical practice. (4) All major psychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are closely associated with physical disorders. By understanding the medical problems of psychiatric patients, psychiatrists can explain to their colleagues in other specialties some significant medical findings that may require immediate attention. Since physical and psychiatric comorbidity is relatively common in general practice, these aspects should be given equal importance. (5) Prevalence of Medical Illnesses among Psychiatric Patients Comorbidities between physical and psychiatric disorders are not uncommon. Over the last 30 years, several studies conducted to determine the prevalence of medical illnesses among psychiatric patients reported prevalence rates of 28% to 92% (Table 1). (6-14) In one study, physical illness was underdiagnosed and not diagnosed in 67% and 50% of the patients, respectively. (6) An unusually high prevalence rate of 90% was reported by a study that included 100 state hospital psychiatric patients who were consecutively admitted to a research ward. In this study, 46% of the patients had an unrecognised medical illness that either caused or exacerbated their psychiatric illness, 80% had physical illnesses that required treatment, and 4% exhibited precancerous conditions. (8) In a study by Bunce et al, 50% of 2395 psychiatric outpatients and 52% of 1448 psychiatric inpatients were found to have a major medical disorder. (10) In a study conducted in a public mental health system, 529 psychiatric patients were medically evaluated. The results revealed important physical diseases in 200 patients; 12% of the patients were found to have physical diseases. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract According to recent evidence traumatic stress is an important etiological factor in pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases. Typical psychological manifestation of the traumatic stress represents dissociative states. Dissociated states present pathological conditions where psychological trauma may emerge in a variety of forms such as psychic dissociative symptoms or on the other hand as somatoform symptoms including seizures. At this time there is evidence that temporal lobe seizure activity may produce dissociative syndrome and this activity likely may exist independently of neurological focal lesion. This conceptualization of dissociative phenomena is in accordance with findings that originate from the study of the relationship between epilepsy and mental illness and known as antagonism between epilepsy and psychosis or the so-called forced normalization. From this point of view the relationship between dissociation, epileptic activity and kindling phenomena represent useful concepts for understanding of neurobiological consequences of the traumatic stress and dissociation with respect to pathogenesis of stress-related mental diseases.",

Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Cognitive functions such as visual spatial reasoning, auditory comprehension, speech production, and extent and severity of motor or sensory impairment are all symptoms of stroke which are commonly used by clinicians to localize lesions to particular brain regions. There is, however, no known neuropathology consistently associated with primary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders not associated with a physical illness), and, even among secondary mood disorders (i.e., mood disorders associated with a physical illness) the idea that there maybe a focal neuropathology associated with the development of major depression has led to both surprise and skepticism.",

Chronic back pain is a more difficult problem, which often has strong psychological overlay: work dissatisfaction, boredom, and a generous compensation system contribute to it. Among the diagnoses offered for chronic pain is fibromyalgia, an urban condition (the diagnosis is not made in rural settings) that does not differ materially from other instances of widespread chronic pain. Although disc protrusions detected on X-ray are often blamed, they rarely are responsible for the pain, and surgery is seldom successful at alleviating it.

To date, no grief staging theory has been able to map bereavement's typical course and pattern.

This chapter focuses on the consequences of TBIs after patients have had substantial time to recover. Brain injuries may be the basis of long-term impairments in physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning, including executive functioning. If the TBI led to a loss of consciousness, there will be an enduring, dense amnesia for the unconscious time period. Following a TBI, there is great variability in the types of cognitive deficits and the severity of those deficits depending on which areas of the brain have been affected. It is extremely challenging to integrate a patient's history of head trauma into the overall picture of an individual's clinical situation, including the psychosocial consequences of the traumatic injury. There may be considerable recovery from a TBI in the first couple of years after an initial injury.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

Prevalence of psychiatric illnesses during pregnancy is similar to that in the general population, whereas that number significantly increases in the postpartum period. Peripartum has its own uniqueness for both etiology and presentation of different psychopathological conditions. Multiple studies have been published describing affective, anxiety, and psychotic illnesses in peripartum. Specific psychosocial circumstances during that time along with multiple physiological changes occurring in female body in that reproductive period predispose women with and without previous psychiatric histories, to various psychiatric illnesses. Several potential contributing factors for these phenomena have been proposed so far. One of the most frequently studied ones has been the drastic hormonal shift occurring during peripartum that could directly increase the sensitivity for developing mood instability, anxiety and/or psychotic symptoms. Genetic predisposition and previously existing psychiatric disorder especially those occuring during specific reproductive phases significantly increase the risk as well. Presentation of psychiatric illnesses during peripartum has its’ particularities which are essential to understand of in order to provide an appropriate care. Being aware of the potential etiology and risk factors as well as sensitivity to psychopathology of some women in peripartum could greatly improve treatment as well as open up avenues for prevention in this area. Unrecognized and untreated psychiatric illnesses in peripartum have serious consequences.",

      "title": "Сексуальные дисфункции при тревожных расстройствах",
      "abstract": "Введение. Являясь одним из широко распространенных психических заболеваний, тревожные расстройства часто сопровождаются сексуальными дисфункциями. Фармакотерапия, применяемая в лечении тревожных расстройств, в свою очередь может приводить к побочным сексуальным нарушениям. О наличии проблем в интимной сфере при обращении за психиатрической помощью сообщает лишь небольшая часть пациентов. Однако несвоевременное выявление сексуальных дисфункций может снижать приверженность терапии и ее эффективность. Материалы и методы. Статья посвящена обзору, основанному на 21 источнике, в том числе на 9 систематических обзорах и других исследованиях. Поиск данных осуществлялся по названиям, аннотациям и ключевым словам: сексуальная дисфункция, тревожное и стрессовое расстройства (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) в базах данных Elibrary и PubMed. Результаты. При тревожных расстройствах сексуальные дисфункции наблюдаются как у мужчин, так и у женщин и проявляются нарушениями всех фаз сексуальных реакций. Взаимосвязь сексуальных дисфункций с тревожными расстройствами объясняется тремя моделями. Первая, включающая причинно-следственные связи, предполагает, что корреляция между сексуальной дисфункцией и тревожными расстройствами часто является двунаправленной, причем симптомы сексуального и тревожного расстройства могут проявляться одновременно. Вторая модель предполагает наличие общего основного фактора или скрытой предиспозиции, вызывающих со временем развитие как психических, так и сексуальных расстройств, Третья модель концептуализирует сексуальные дисфункции как нарушения, не связанные с тревожными расстройствами. Заключение. На основании проведенного исследования авторами рекомендован следующий алгоритм курации пациентов, страдающих тревожными расстройствами и сексуальными нарушениями. На этапе обращения за психиатрической помощью, наряду со стандартными методами диагностики для определения выраженности психической патологии, целесообразно использовать опросники для оценки сексуальной функции. Кроме того, следует учитывать возможное негативное влияние фармакотерапии на сексуальную функцию и оценивать ее на всех этапах лечения для проведения своевременной коррекции. При выявлении сексуальных нарушений у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами с учетом клинической ситуации по возможности назначаются психотропные препараты с минимальным негативным влиянием на сексуальную функцию или без такового. При невозможности применения таких средств после достижения коррекции тревожной симптоматики могут быть снижены дозы используемых психотропных препаратов, рекомендованы перерывы в их приеме, в основном за 1-2 дня до предполагаемого сексуального контакта. При сохранении сексуальных нарушений в схему лечения в качестве антидота добавляется антидепрессант без влияния на сексуальную функцию или препараты для коррекции сексуальных нарушений – ингибиторы фосфодиэстеразы 5-го типа. Психотерапевтические мероприятия, включающие секс-терапию, являются неотъемлемой частью лечения сексуальных дисфункций у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами. Background. Anxiety disorders, being one of the widespread mental illnesses, are often accompanied by sexual dysfunctions. In turn, pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of affective disorders can lead to adverse sexual disorders. Only a small proportion of patients report having problems in the intimate sphere when seeking psychiatric help. However, untimely detection of sexual dysfunctions can reduce adherence and effectiveness of therapy. Materials and methods. The article is devoted to a review based on 21 sources, of which 9 are systematic reviews, as well as other studies. The data was searched by names, annotations and keywords: sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) in the databases Elibrary and PubMed. Results. In anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions are observed in both men and women and are manifested by violations of all phases of sexual reactions. The relationship of sexual dysfunction with anxiety disorders is explained by three models: the first, which includes causal relationships, suggests that the correlation between sexual dysfunction and anxiety disorders is often bidirectional, and the symptoms of sexual and anxiety disorders can manifest simultaneously; The second model assumes the presence of a common underlying factor, or hidden predisposition, causing the development of both mental and sexual disorders over time; the third model conceptualizes sexual dysfunctions as disorders unrelated to anxiety disorders. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, the authors recommended the following algorithm for the supervision of patients suffering from anxiety disorders and sexual disorders: at the stage of seeking psychiatric help, along with standard diagnostic methods to determine the severity of mental pathology, it is advisable to use questionnaires to assess sexual function. In addition, the possible negative effect of pharmacotherapy on sexual function should be taken into account and evaluated at all stages of treatment in order to carry out timely correction. If sexual disorders are detected in patients with anxiety disorders, taking into account the clinical situation, psychotropic drugs with no or minimal negative effect on sexual function are prescribed, if possible. In cases where it is impossible to use such drugs, after achieving correction of anxiety symptoms, the doses of psychotropic drugs used may be reduced, interruptions in their intake, mainly 1-2 days before the alleged sexual contact. If sexual disorders persist, an antidepressant with no effect on sexual function is added to the treatment regimen as an antidote, or drugs for correcting sexual disorders – type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Psychotherapeutic measures, including sex therapy, are an integral part of the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in patients with anxiety disorders.",

From the hysterical state that is a total alteration of personality to the case in which hysterical manifestations appear as a sort of foreign body in the personality is a wide gap, which extends from an innate or constitutional disorder to an easily curable condition. The group of cases here presented have a physiology or, at any rate, a physiologic psychology which, once understood, opens the doors to a rapid cure. But unless their mechanism of disability is understood the patients may be markedly incapacitated and wander from physician to physician vainly seeking help. In other words, a superficial pathologic condition blocks the normal conduct reactions of the individual as thoroughly as the deeper lying disorder in those cases in which hysteria is really a psychosis demoralizes the individual.",

Exposure therapy, that is implemented as part of cognitive and behavioral psychotherapeutic approaches, has been found to be effective for treating specific phobias, compared to no treatment, placebo treatment, or alternative psychotherapeutic treatment. More research needs to take place however on specific phobias, which have been understudied compared to other anxiety disorders. At the same time, the outcomes of psychotherapy for specific phobias need to be examined longitudinally, so that the long-term effectiveness of therapy can be assessed. Finally, due to the fact that specific phobias are a heterogenous group of disorder, it is difficult to draw informed conclusions as to the effectiveness of various psychotherapeutic approaches for all specific phobias.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression, a debilitating illness characterised by a persistent depressed mood that impairs normal function, exerts an enormous health and financial cost worldwide. Diagnosis of depression is complex, as not all people experience the same symptoms, with diagnosis based on a series of questions as no biological test is currently available. This is due to the fact that the causes of depression have yet to be fully elucidated, although development of depression appears to be dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. While there is no cure for depression, psychological, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches successfully manage the symptoms of many patients. However, there are patients that are refractive to current treatments, highlighting the need for improved diagnostics and therapeutics. For this, increased understanding of the neurobiology underlying depression is necessary, requiring further research utilising both animal models of depression and human clinical studies. Key Concepts The diagnosis of depression is complex, is based on the types and duration of the symptoms and is commonly complicated by the presence of comorbid conditions. While there is no cure for depression, symptoms of depression can be managed through a variety of cognitive, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches. Depression is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Human imaging studies suggest that depression is correlated with activity changes in multiple brain regions. Animal models are necessary to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that lead to depression and to test novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "[LOW BACK PAIN AT NEW WORKING AMBIENT IN ERA OF NEW ECONOMY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL RISK FACTORS].",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is the second most common symptom-related reason for physician visits and the first reason of working disability. Low back pain is a ubiquitous complaint, with particularly high prevalence among people in their working years (67%). For many individuals, episodes of back pain are self-limited and resolve without specific therapy. For others, however, back pain is recurrent or chronic, causing significant pain that interferes with employment and quality of life. Many occupations have been anecdotally linked to certain low back pain syndrome. However, the relationship between the work environment and the patient's symptoms, though clearly perceived by the patient to be causative, may be less certain. The injury model of an occupational disorder proposes that specific work activities are the cause of the patient's pain. The injury model for low back pain; implicating a causal connection with specific work activities, is complex and controversial. Determining whether a patient's low back pain is a consequence of his or her occupational activity, and how best to treat symptoms to maximize functionality and potential for a return to full employment capacity, can be challenging. In this systematic review which included patients/employees with low back pain, the following databases were searched: Pub Med, Embase, Medline and Web of science. The role of occupational mechanical exposure e.g. lifting as a risk factors for low back surgery has been debated for several decades. Diagnostic uncertainty exists even for those with back symptoms and well-described findings on scan, as these findings are common even in subjects without back pain, and may be unrelated to the symptoms. As an example, herniated disks can be identified in significant numbers of CT or MRI low back studies in subjects with no back pain. In further analysis, lifestyle factors and occupational psychosocial exposures will be addressed. Many physicians, including those practicing in primary care settings where back pain is most often seen, lack training and confidence in addressing workplace issues. Occupational factors that have a significant influence on the development of low back pain disorders are not only mechanical and postural order but also organisational, social and psychological. Organisational changes and physical and psychological job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistant impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). There is some evidence that catastrophizing as a stress coping strategy might lead to delayed recovery. Long-term work (sick) absence can be estimated through evaluation and observation of LBP risks and characteristics of the each individual case. An early return at workplace and to activities of daily life is urgent. To reduce LBS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaced approach: concentrate on improving physical conditions as well as the psychosocial and environmental aspects of working environment. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation and occupational rehabilitation interventions (occupational reintegration) should be provided.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged mourning has been recorded as a precipitant life event in RA and other autoimmune disorders, but other events such as retirement, redundancy and injury have also been identified. The author's submission is that pathological mourning is present in all patients with AI disease, and that other events such as those mentioned are only precipitant because they uncover mourning until then kept in check by occupation and use of work as a drug. When time for reflection and loneliness allows long suppressed ambivalent feelings, guilt and bitterness to surface, remorse over 'unfinished business' increasingly dominates the patient's thoughts. Children and young people rarely have the opportunity to mourn, thus early loss is often paramount and is awakened from the unconscious years later when further losses of key figures or surrogates, including pets, occur or are anticipated. Psychotherapy involves helping patients resolve their pathological mourning.",

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome, a rare form of cranial dystonia, manifests as involuntary spasms affecting the facial and neck muscles. Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

      "abstract": "Clinical depression or major depressive disorder is the medical term used to refer to the disease 'depression'. While a common disorder in the general community, and not surprisingly more prevalent in the sick, depression has assumed over recent decades greater familiarity. The relationship between cancer and depression may be bidirectional. Depression can be an early or occult symptom of a malignancy, and is a common complication of cancer. The symptoms of depression are affective, cognitive and somatic. Depression is best conceptualised as a spectrum disorder, the symptoms ranging from mild to very severe. A correct diagnosis of major depression allows one of the most confident estimations of response to treatment known to medicine. From the clinical perspective a crucial decision is whether/not to introduce biological interventions. A psychological intervention is mandatory, whereas physical treatment interventions should be reserved for moderate and severe depression. Initially psycho-education about depressive disorders is necessary, and indeed this process is really the introduction of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Συγκριτική μελέτη επιθετικότητας - επικινδυνότητας σε ασθενείς με σχιζοφρένεια",
      "abstract": "Η σχιζοφρένεια είναι μια πολύ σοβαρή ψυχική διαταραχή, που εμφανίζεται σε κλινική μορφή με χρόνια ψυχωσικά επεισόδια, παραληρητικές ιδέες, ψευδαισθήσεις, εκσεσημασμένο άγχος, περίεργη συμπεριφορά και αυτοκτονικές τάσεις. Τα αίτιά της είναι άγνωστα, όμως κληρονομικοί παράγοντες και νευροβιολογικές ανισορροπίες στη χημεία του εγκεφάλου, μπορούν να αυξήσουν την ευαλωτότητα ή την προδιάθεση του ατόμου να πυροδοτήσει ψυχωσικά επεισόδια. Οι υπάρχουσες μελέτες πάνω στη σχιζοφρένεια από τα πεδία της ψυχιατρικής ή της ψυχιατροδικαστικής, την προβάλλουν ως ένα σημαντικό παράγοντα κινδύνου για άσκηση βίας ή και τέλεση αξιόποινης πράξης. Η σύνδεσή της με το έγκλημα έχει αποτυπωθεί και σε ελληνική, αλλά κυρίως σε ξένη βιβλιογραφία, υποδεικνύοντας τη μεγάλη της συσχέτιση με άνδρες, άγαμους, που εμφανίζουν πλημμελή συμμόρφωση στη λήψη φαρμακευτικής αγωγής, συννοσηρότητα και μεγάλη διάρκεια της νόσου. Η παρούσα ελληνική μελέτη είχε σκοπό να αναδείξει τα ιδιαίτερα χαρακτηριστικά προσωπικότητας και ψυχικής διαταραχής Ελλήνων ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια, που εμφανίζουν επιθετική/ βίαιη συμπεριφορά, διαπράττουν βίαια εγκλήματα, όπως η ανθρωποκτονία και η απόπειρα ανθρωποκτονίας. Παράλληλα, έγινε προσπάθεια να αναλυθεί ο τρόπος που διαφοροποιούνται αυτά τα χαρακτηριστικά και η άσκηση βίας σε σχέση με άλλα άτομα με σχιζοφρένεια, που δεν εμφανίζουν βίαιη συμπεριφορά. Η σπουδαιότητα της μελέτης έγκειται στο γεγονός ότι στη χώρα μας έως σήμερα δεν υπάρχουν στοιχεία σχετικά με το ζήτημα αυτό, ενώ στερεοτυπικές και στιγματιστικές αντιλήψεις κυριαρχούν ακόμη απέναντι σε άτομα που αντιμετωπίζουν προβλήματα ψυχικής υγείας και πάσχουν από μείζονες ψυχικές διαταραχές, όπως η σχιζοφρένεια. Υπάρχει η ανάγκη διεξαγωγής μελετών σχετικά με την επιθετικότητα και την επικινδυνότητα των ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια, καθώς η αποασυλοποίηση και η κοινωνική επανένταξή τους είναι σε εξέλιξη. Μεθοδολογικά, αποτελεί μια συγχρονική μελέτη , σε δείγμα 220 ανδρών, που πληρούσαν τα διαγνωστικά κριτήρια DSM-IV-TR της σχιζοφρένειας. Διεξήχθη από τον Ιανουάριο του 2011 έως το Νοέμβριο του 2015, σε ασθενείς που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια στο Ψυχιατρικό Νοσοκομείο Αττικής «ΔΑΦΝΙ» ή που νοσηλεύονταν ως ακαταλόγιστοι ή κρατούνταν στο Ψυχιατρικό Τμήμα του Καταστήματος Κράτησης Κορυδαλλού. Η μελέτη συσχέτισε τρεις ομάδες ασθενών: α) Ομάδα Α (Σχιζοφρένεια - χωρίς ιστορικό βίας), 74 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια σε τμήματα οξέων περιστατικών του Ψυχιατρικού Νοσοκομείου Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ», β) Ομάδα Β (Σχιζοφρένεια – με Βία ή Βίαιο έγκλημα) 74 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), με ιστορικό βίαιης συμπεριφοράς, που νοσηλεύονταν ακούσια σε τμήματα οξέων περιστατικών του Ψυχιατρικού Νοσοκομείου Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ» (Ν=43) ή κρατούνταν στο Ψυχιατρικό Τμήμα του Καταστήματος Κράτησης Κορυδαλλού - ΨΚΚ (Ν=31) και γ) Ομάδα Γ (Σχιζοφρένεια – Ακαταλόγιστοι – Βίαιο έγκλημα), 72 ασθενείς με διάγνωση σχιζοφρένειας και συναφών διαταραχών (DSM-IV-TR), που νοσηλεύονταν σύμφωνα με το ά.69 του Ποινικού Κώδικα (ακαταλόγιστοι), στο Ψυχιατρικό Νοσοκομείο Αττικής - ΨΝΑ, «ΔΑΦΝΙ». Επίσης, πραγματοποιήθηκαν συγκρίσεις (με μονοπαραγοντικά και πολυπαραγοντικά μοντέλα λογιστικής παλινδρόμησης) α) των ασθενών του ΨΚΚ με ασθενείς του ΨΝΑ, στην Ομάδα Β, β) Ομάδας Γ με ασθενείς του ΨΚΚ, της Ομάδας Β, γ) Ομάδας Γ με ασθενείς του ΨΝΑ,της Ομάδας Β, δ) Ομάδας Γ με Ομάδα Β σε υποσύνολο ασθενών με διατακτικές ψευδαισθήσεις, για τη διαπίστωση των πιθανοτήτων να ανήκουν τα άτομα σε ομάδα μεγαλύτερης βαρύτητας, θεωρώντας ότι η διάταξη από τη χαμηλότερη προς τη μεγαλύτερη βαρύτητα είναι : ΨΝΑ - Β Ομάδας, ΨΚΚ - Β Ομάδας και Ομάδα Γ. Τα δεδομένα των ασθενών ελήφθησαν μέσω συνεντεύξεων και δομημένων/ημι-δομημένων διαγνωστικών διεργασιών και ψυχομετρικών εργαλείων. Η κλινική εκτίμηση και διάγνωση διατυπώθηκε σύμφωνα με το DSM-IV-TR. Τα κύρια συμπεράσματα της μελέτης υποδεικνύουν ότι το δείγμα μας αποτελούνταν ως επί το πλείστον από ασθενείς με παρανοειδούς τύπου σχιζοφρένεια, κυρίως άγαμοι, με πολύ περιορισμένους συναισθηματικούς δεσμούς και χωρίς πρόσφατους συναισθηματικούς δεσμούς. Είχαν χαμηλό έως μέτριο βιοτικό επίπεδο, χαμηλές έως μέτριες ακαδημαϊκές επιδόσεις και περιορισμένη επαγγελματική δραστηριότητα. Οι περισσότεροι ασθενείς εμφάνισαν πλημμελή συμμόρφωση στη φαρμακευτική τους αγωγή. Οι πιο σοβαροί ψυχο-κοινωνικοί, προδιαθεσικοί παράγοντες που αναδείχθηκαν προπαντός για τις «βίαιες» ομάδες, ήταν η κακή σχέση με τους γονείς, το διαζύγιο γονέων σε μικρή ηλικία των ασθενών, η επιρροή των συνομηλίκων υπό την έννοια της ένταξης σε συμμορίες ή σε «κακές παρέες», το ιστορικό νεανικής παραβατικότητας και η μη ύπαρξη υποστηρικτικού περιβάλλοντος. Φάνηκε ότι έκαναν περιστασιακή χρήση ουσιών, κυρίως κάνναβης και αλκοόλ. Τα περισσότερα άτομα παρουσίασαν προηγούμενο ιστορικό βίας πριν από την έναρξη της νόσου και προ ενηλικίωσης, όπως νεανική παραβατικότητα, λεκτική επιθετικότητα, συγκρούσεις με την οικογένειά τους, βανδαλισμούς και συλλήψεις. Τα περισσότερα άτομα (75%) επίσης, δεν παρουσίασαν στη συμπτωματολογία τους ιστορικό διατακτικών ακουστικών ψευδαισθήσεων, αλλά όσα εμφάνισαν, ανήκαν στις «βίαιες» ομάδες. Σαφώς όμως, η Ομάδα Β και η Ομάδα Γ κατέγραψαν τα υψηλότερα ποσοστά βίας. Η σοβαρότητα του ιστορικού βίας ή επιθετικής συμπεριφοράς/ εγκληματικότητας σε σχέση με την έναρξη της νόσου, κυρίως για τις Ομάδες της «βίας», διαφαίνεται από τη λεκτική επιθετικότητα προ της εισαγωγής για νοσηλεία ή κατά τη νοσηλεία, από ετεροκαταστροφικότητα απέναντι σε πρόσωπα και αντικείμενα προ της εισαγωγής για νοσηλεία. Η μελέτη υπογράμμισε τις διαφοροποιήσεις των τριών ομάδων σε σχέση με τη βία, που επιβεβαιώθηκαν από τις θετικές και αρνητικές υποκλίμακες, της κλίμακας PANSS. Από την περαιτέρω σύγκριση των υπο-ομάδων φάνηκε να διατηρούνται τα αποτελέσματα της σύγκρισης Ομάδας Γ έναντι Ομάδας Β, ακόμη και στις υποομάδες ασθενών με σχιζοφρένεια στο ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ, της Ομάδας Β. Πιο συγκεκριμένα, το εύρημα αρνητικής συσχέτισης μεταξύ διάρκειας χρήσης κάνναβης και πιθανότητας να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να επιβεβαιώνεται καθαρά, όταν η σύγκριση επικεντρώνεται στην υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β, των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΝΑ. Για την υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΚΚ, η σχέση ήταν λιγότερο ισχυρή και μη στατιστικά σημαντική. Το εύρημα σχετικά με τη θετική σχέση αλκοόλ και Ομάδας Γ επιβεβαιώνεται, όταν η σύγκριση επικεντρώνεται στην υπο-ομάδα της Ομάδας Β, των ασθενών που νοσηλεύονταν στο ΨΝΑ, ενώ για το ΨΚΚ δεν ήταν στατιστικά σημαντικό. Η αρνητική σχέση της νεανικής παραβατικότητας και πιθανότητας να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να διατηρείται σχεδόν αναλλοίωτη και στις δύο επιπλέον συγκρίσεις (Ομάδα Γ έναντι Β-ΨΝΑ και Ομάδα Γ έναντι Β-ΨΚΚ). Το ίδιο ισχύει και για τη θετική σχέση μεταξύ των μεγάλων χρονικών διαστημάτων μεταξύ έναρξης νόσου και εκδήλωσης εγκληματικότητας της Ομάδας Γ και για την αρνητική σχέση μεταξύ μέτριας ή κακής υγείας (κατά το ψυχομετρικό εργαλείο SF36) και της πιθανότητας ο ασθενής να ανήκει στην Ομάδα Γ. Οι θετικές σχέσεις με τις υποκλίμακες Θ1 (παραληρητικές ιδέες) και A6 (έλλειψη αυθορμητισμού και ροής στην ομιλία) της κλίμακας PANSS, το σκορ της κλίμακας PCL_SV για την ψυχοπαθητικότητα και τους ψυχοκοινωνικούς προδιαθεσικούς παράγοντες, που υποδεικνύουν την πιθανότητα να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ, φαίνεται να διατηρούνται τουλάχιστον ως προς την κατεύθυνση της σχέσης (δηλαδή οι σχέσεις παραμένουν θετικές) και στις επιπλέον συγκρίσεις των υπο-ομάδων ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ, με την Ομάδα Γ, ενώ σε αρκετές περιπτώσεις διατηρούν και τη στατιστική τους σημαντικότητα. Αντίστοιχα, η υποκλίμακα Θ7 (εχθρότητα) της κλίμακας PANSS είχε αρνητική σχέση με τις πιθανότητες να ανήκει ο ασθενής στην Ομάδα Γ. Αυτή η αρνητική σχέση με την υποκλίμακα Θ7 (εχθρότητα), όπως εκτιμήθηκε στη συνολική σύγκριση της ομάδας Γ με την ομάδα Β, παραμένει σχεδόν αναλλοίωτη και στατιστικά σημαντική και στις επιμέρους συγκρίσειςτων υποομάδων ΨΚΚ και ΨΝΑ με την ομάδα Γ. Εν γένει, μπορεί να ειπωθεί ότι η μελέτη της βίας σε άτομα που πάσχουν από σοβαρές ψυχικές διαταραχές, όπως η σχιζοφρένεια, προσφέρει πληθώρα γνώσεων για τη βαθύτερη αντίληψη και κατανόηση των μηχανισμών, που υποβόσκουν στην εκδήλωση μιας βίαιης και επιθετικής συμπεριφοράς, αλλά και γύρω από την ανάπτυξη προληπτικών και θεραπευτικών παρεμβάσεων με σκοπό την καλύτερη εκτίμηση της επικινδυνότητας, τη μείωση βίαιων συμπεριφορών και τη μείωση υποτροπών σε τέτοιους ασθενείς.Λέξεις κλειδιά: σχιζοφρένεια, ανθρωποκτονία, εγκληματικότητα, βία, επιθετικότητα ουσιοεξάρτηση.",
