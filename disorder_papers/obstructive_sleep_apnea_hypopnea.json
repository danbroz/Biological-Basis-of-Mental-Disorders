      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and obesity: A dangerous triad",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing. It is characterized by recurrent partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways during sleep, which leads to repetitive episodes of reduction (hypopnea) or absence of airflow (apnea) and intermittent hypoxia and arousal.1 The major risk factors for OSA are obesity, male sex, and advanced age.2 The prevalence of OSA is continuously increasing in developed countries in conjunction with the epidemic obesity.3, 4 The present \"gold\" standard for evaluation of sleep and sleep-related breathing is the polysomnography (PSG) with up to 12 recording channels including nasal and oral airflow, respiratory effort transducers, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and oximetry.5 The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is classified based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)—number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour: 5-15, mild; 15-30, moderate; 30 or more, severe.4 The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort study recently reported that the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (ie, AHI ≥ 15 events per hour) was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7-12) among 30- to 49-year-old men; 17% (95% CI: 15-21) among 50- to 70-year-old men; 3% (95% CI: 2-4) among 30- to 49-year-old women; and 9% (95% CI: 7-11) among 50- to 70-year-old women.6 These estimated prevalence rates represent a substantial increase over the last 2 decades (relative increase of 14%-55%, depending on the subgroup). There is overwhelming epidemiologic evidence supporting the causal, bidirectional relationship between OSA and hypertension (HTN). Not only that OSA predisposes patients to HTN development, but also increases an incidence of OSA in hypertensive patients.4, 7, 8 Numerous studies have shown the strong association between OSA and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, large vessel disease, and cerebrovascular disease.4, 9, 10 The main acute changes in OSA are intermittent hypoxia, intrapleural pressure changes, and sleep fragmentation, which together induce endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, and increased oxidative stress.4, 11 Another mechanism, that potentially could contribute to the development of HTN in OSA, is increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).12 Obesity, especially central adiposity, has been recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for OSA for a long time. Due to current pandemic of obesity in the Western countries, the prevalence of OSA is likely to increase.13 In the Sleep Heart Health Study, weight gain of 10 kilograms over a 5-year period conferred a 5.2- and 2.5-fold increase in the likelihood of increasing the AHI by 15 events per hour in men and women, respectively.14 Obesity and OSA tend to coexist and they are associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure (BP), but the causal relation is still not clear.15 While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the main therapy for OSA, its effect on blood pressure (BP) reduction has not been established yet due to the multifactorial nature of HTN.4 Moreover, the impact of CPAP treatment on BP is inconsistent: In minimally symptomatic patients, CPAP has a neutral effect on BP,16 whereas in subjects with resistant hypertension, CPAP can decrease the systolic BP by 5-7 mm Hg.17 Although obesity is a risk factor for OSA and an independent risk factor for HTN, the influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA is unknown. Moreover, data regarding influence of obesity on BP response to CPAP treatment in adults with OSA are still scarce. In this issue of the Journal, Kuna et al assessed the BP response to CPAP treatment in obese and non-obese adults with OSA.18 This consecutive multicenter study included 188 OSA patients with AHI ≥ 15, which were divided into two groups: obese and non-obese subjects. Additionally, they underwent 24-hour BP monitoring and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine collection at baseline. Obesity was assessed by waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and abdominal visceral fat volume (captured with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Participants adherent to CPAP treatment were reassessed after 4 months. Primary outcomes were 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine level. The results indicate that obesity was not the factor that influenced BP response to treatment of adults with OSA and that BP response to CPAP treatment was not related to baseline 24-hour urinary norepinephrine or change in 24-hour urinary norepinephrine after treatment. Several previous studies reported that change in sympathetic nervous activity, measured by plasma or urinary catecholamine levels, did not correlate with the BP response to CPAP treatment.19-21 Although measurement of urinary catecholamine levels did not detect the effect of sympathetic overactivity on BP in adults with OSA, the authors postulate that it might be possible that measuring muscle sympathetic nerve activity could reveal a significant relationship because sympathetic overactivity has an important role in OSA-related cardiovascular remodeling22 and contributes to a cardiovascular morbidity in these patients23 While the authors found that the participants with OSA had a significant reduction in 24-hour mean arterial pressure following CPAP treatment, there were no significant correlations between the three obesity measures (waist circumference, BMI, and abdominal visceral fat) and change in BP measures. In addition, investigators did not find differences in BP responses comparing obese and non-obese participants. The authors explained negative results by the limited number of subjects in both groups—obese and non-obese patients and suggested that larger studies are necessary. Although the results appear negative, this current study definitely has several important strengths. First, the objective to determine the BP response after CPAP treatment in obese patients was novel. Second, the authors used several parameters for obesity assessment such as waist circumference, body mass index, and abdominal fat volume and not only body mass index, as it is the case with previous studies. Continuous positive airway pressure is recognized as an effective therapy for OSA, but adherence is still suboptimal despite numerous developments in machine dynamics including quieter pumps, softer masks, and improved portability.24 Adherence to CPAP remains relatively low (30%-60%), which continues to be the largest problem with this kind of therapy.25 The main limitation of the present study, which was also claimed by the authors, was a limited sample size that significantly decreased statistical power to less than 80%. The study did not include individuals who were non-adherent to CPAP in order to compare them with those who used CPAP. Additionally, the current investigation involved also normotensive individuals. However, previous studies revealed that patients with higher baseline BP and untreated or resistant HTN had the largest benefit from CPAP therapy.17, 26 It is well known that obesity represents a major risk factor for OSA.2 Surprisingly, there is still a lack of clinical data on the response (eg, BP reduction) to existing therapies such as CPAP in obese and non-obese patients with OSA. The detailed phenotyping and physiological characteristics of obese and non-obese OSA patients and their response to prescribed therapy remain to be clarified in larger, prospective, and randomized studies in the future.

He repeatedly experiences episodic hypoxemia, which, in turn, disrupts his sleep. (This use of the male pronoun is convenient and correct, statistically; OSA is rare in women.) Obstructive sleep apnea is a multisystem disorder involving metabolic, respiratory, and neural abnormalities. The cause of the airway obstruction is multifaceted and includes the following: structural encroachment on the oropharyngeal lumen, subatmospheric intrapharyngeal pressure, and hypotonicity of oropharyngeal muscles. Similarly, secondary disease manifestations appear in multiple systems; respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and hypersomnolence are characteristic of severe OSA, and this complex is usually referred to",

      "title": "Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases affecting the respiratory system are usually present during the day and the night; however, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a disease manifesting only during sleep. It is defined as a cessation (apnea) or a reduction of breathing (hypopnea) of 10 seconds or more during sleep. Each of these apneas or hypopneas is usually terminated when the person awakens for a few seconds. Typically, patients do not remember these transient awakenings. There are two general categories of apnea: central and obstructive. These categories are classified according to the presence or the absence of respiratory effort. Central sleep apnea is a result of the absence of nerve impulses from the brain to the respiratory muscles and therefore occurs in absence of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea is much more common. This condition is caused by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway (pharynx) during sleep. Therefore, respiratory efforts are still present during apnea and usually increase throughout the apnea. The individual makes larger and larger respiratory efforts until they arouse from sleep apnea and reopen their upper airway so breathing can resume. As will be discussed, some overlap exists between obstructive and central apnea in both disease presentation (so‐called mixed apnea) and in pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "title": "Is Pulmonary Hypertension Common in Uncomplicated OSA?",
      "abstract": "Accessible online at: www.karger.com/journals/res Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its clinical counterpart, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), encompass the pathophysiology of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The defining event for OSA is an unstable upper airway leading to flow limitation (hypopnea) or complete obstruction (apnea). The working definition of OSAHS for clinical research is restless sleep, includes disruptive snoring, and daytime sleepiness (including fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and inattention); both are to be accompanied by more than 5 events (apneas and/or hypopneas) during sleep [1]. Some efforts are being made to refocus working definitions for OSAHS away from counting only respiratory events to the describing appearance of arousals from sleep as the events that lead to daytime sleepiness/fatigue/inattention and even hypertension [2]. Here the literature seems to point to arousals as being as an important factor determining changes in blood pressure during sleep [3], but the effects on daytime (wakefulness) cardiovascular function are, in animal models, quite modest [4]. What about hypoxemia? There is a debate concerning the necessity and implications for working definitions of an apnea or hypopnea to include a fall in oxygen saturation as a defining criterion for apnea or hypopnea [5]. The fall in oxygen saturation that is a consequence of an apnea or hypopnea represents the sum total of pre-event gas exchange and event length and type [6]. In the case of an individual with a normal alveolar-arterial gradient, the fall in oxygen saturation may not be very great despite a considerable fall in PaO2; in contrast, a person who is hypoxic during the day will have a greater fall in oxygen saturation for a similar change in PaO2 with sleep onset or sleep apnea. In any event episodic changes in oxygenation can be quantified [7] and experimentally correlated with triggering sustained changes in blood pressure, increases in pulmonary artery pressure and up-regulation of systems than have long-lasting effects on cardiovascular homeostasis [8]. Therefore, episodic hypoxemia appears important. The report in this issue of Respiration by Alchanatis et al. [9] has a focus on pulmonary hypertension as a feature of uncomplicated OSA. One notable feature is its design. First, there is case control in regard to estimated pulmonary artery pressures in the presence or absence of sleep apnea in people matched for age, BMI and (normal) lung function. (OSAHS was higher.) Second, there was demonstrated an acceptable correlation between direct measurements and the noninvasive estimates of pulmonary artery measurements. Third, there was a good follow-up of the patients. Those with OSA and pulmonary artery pressures 120 mm Hg (the defining event for pulmonary hypertension in this report) were older, heavier, and had a slightly lower (but normal) PaO2 during wakefulness. Their finding indicates that pulmonary hypertension can occur in patients without overt cardiopulmonary problems.",

Indeed, in many respiratory clinics OSAHS is now the most common diagnosis. Neurologists need to be familiar with the OSAHS because it may present rather like some primarily neurological conditions, and because patients with neurological and neuromuscular disorders can develop the OSAHS. Indeed, in the February 2002 issue of <i>Practical Neurology</i>, Sam Berkovic and Philip King urged neurologists to wake up to sleep medicine (Berkovic &amp; King 2002). The best definition of the OSAHS is at least five, some would say 15, breathing pauses (apnoeas) or hypopnoeas (near apnoeas), each lasting 10 s or more, per hour of sleep in association with sleepiness or at least two other major symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, unrefreshing nocturnal sleep or nocturia (Table 1).

Vigilance profile during sleep, that is, interchange and frequency of each of sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) are similar in both tested groups. The suppression of restitutive stages of sleep (III, IV, REM) is considered to be a dominant characteristic of vigilance during sleep in obese persons and obese persons with manifest apnea syndrome. Relatively prolonged sleep latency in obese persons without manifest apnea syndrome indicates, however, restitutively higher quality of their nocturnal sleep.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repeated periods of breathing cessation during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnoea is both common and underdiagnosed in the obese. A recent study found that as many as 86% of older obese type 2 diabetics had obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity is independently associated with developing obstructive sleep apnoea, and the reverse may also occur. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is therefore expected to rise in the wake of the obesity epidemic. The number of partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) airway obstructions per hour (apnoea-hypopnoea index) is used to classify obstructive sleep apnoea as mild (5-14 events per hour), moderate (15-30) or severe (>30). Severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with a two to sixfold increase in all-cause mortality; the impact of mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnoea is less clear. Until recently, the evidence supporting a beneficial effect of weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea has been limited by a lack of randomized trials. In 2009, at least three randomized controlled trials evaluated whether medically induced weight loss improves obstructive sleep apnoea. The treatment effect ranged from 42% to 62% improvement, although the highest estimate was seen in a very short duration study (9 weeks). Patients who either lost 10-15 kg or more, or had severe obstructive sleep apnoea at baseline, benefited most from treatment.",

      "abstract": "The neurobehavioral deficits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are often attributed to the rate of respiratory disturbance or rate of arousals during sleep. However, sleep disordered breathing is also associated with other changes in sleep infrastructure that may account for cumulative waking deficits. This was illustrated in polysomnographic data from 1,521 patients with OSAS where increasing arousal indices were associated with increased duration of stage 1 sleep and concomitant reduction in total sleep time. Similar results have been found in paradigms in which sleep was experimentally fragmented in healthy individuals. It appears that chronic fragmentation of sleep, whether by apneas or acoustic stimuli, leads to cumulative homeostatic pressure for sleep, which may explain a number of phenomenan characteristic of both untreated OSAS patients and experimentally fragmented sleepers: (1) increased arousal threshold, (2) rapid return to sleep after arousal, (3) fewer awakenings over time, (4) increased sleep inertia on awakenings, (5) increased amnesia for arousals, and (6) daytime sleepiness. Elevated homeostatic drive for sleep appears to be a function of both the frequency of arousals within a night and the chronicity of sleep fragmentation across nights, neither of which have been adequately modeled in experimental studies of healthy subjects.",

      "abstract": "A non-reversible obstructive inflammatory process of the small airways and destruction of the alveolar walls characterizes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

Report of Case A 64 y/o male, with history of ongoing complex movements occurring during his sleep, with no history of strokes or neurological deficits. Had extensive neurologic workup (all negative) including routine electroencephalogram (EEG), prolonged inpatient EEG (12 hours), and MRI of the brain. Home sleep study showing moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) AHI 24/hour successfully treated with CPAP therapy (residual AHI 1.7/hour) with improved nighttime symptoms initially. Wife recalls events as happening only at night while sleep, as patient often confused upon waking up in the morning, at times appear to sit up and smack his lips. No nighttime hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or acting out dreams were reported. Had two episodes associated with tongue biting and loss of bladder control. Another episode happened after a daytime nap, patient went outside and was mowing his lawn, went “completely blank “, appeared confused. No daytime or nighttime seizures were ever noticed. Patient do not recall any of the above events. Repeat EEG was normal. MRI/MRA of the head /neck showed small tiny focus in left frontoparietal lobe, suggesting remote cortical ischemic injury. Polysomnography (PSG) with seizure montage showed Interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) foci recorded in the frontal/frontopolar leads without accompanying body movements. Interictal spike and wave activity seen during stage N2. Initially treated with carbamazepine (had skin reaction) switched to levetiracetam with complete resolution of his symptoms. Conclusion This case illustrates the importance of reviewing the clinical history, behavior semiology, and diagnostic ancillary testing such as polysomnography with EEG monitoring in distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from other nocturnal complex behavior disorders and parasomnias.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

RLS or Willis-Ekbom disease is a relatively common pathology, with a prevalence of around 2.7%. It is underdiagnosed, which has a negative impact on both the quality of sleep and the patient's life. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle.

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders.

Full blown REM sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed clinically, but REM sleep motor dysfunction, a pathophysiological basis of REM sleep behaviour disorder, is difficult to detect without all night polysomnography. Twenty one consecutive patients with multiple system atrophy with no complaints of nocturnal abnormal behaviours were clinically evaluated to determine the presence of sleep related symptoms. All night polysomnography with video monitoring was performed to investigate REM sleep characteristics and patients' behaviours. In 85.7% (18 of 21) of the patients' sleep talk started or increased around or after the clinical onset of the primary diseases. REM sleep without atonia occupied more than 15%(16.2%-100%) of the REM sleep time in all but one patient. In 90.5% (19 of 21) of patients, motor events such as sleep talk and various combinations of craniofacial, orofacial, or limb movements occurred at various frequencies mostly during REM sleep without atonia.

      "abstract": "Daytime breathing problems caused by neurologic lesions always worsen during sleep, and in certain cases abnormal breathing patterns are only seen during sleep or specific sleep states. The first clinical manifestation of maltase deficiency, myopathy, or myotonic dystrophy is often a sleep-related complaint, such as unexplained waking from sleep (insomnia) or daytime somnolence. Thus, systematic investigation during sleep of disorders impairing the loop involved in breathing is strongly encouraged. Lesions may involve sensory receptors, sensory pathways, brainstem-controlling neurons, upper motor neurons, descending motor pathways, lower motor neurons, motor nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or respiratory muscles. Most of these lesions lead to a decrease in or absence of inspiratory efforts (diaphragmatic apnea or hypopnea) during sleep. These events differ from the classic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the recently described upper airway resistance syndrome, which usually involve mild or significant anatomic abnormalities of the upper airway and craniofacial region. The treatment of abnormal breathing during sleep has been improved by the development of nasal ventilation methods: continuous positive airway pressure, intermittent positive pressure, and volume ventilation. These therapeutic approaches can prevent tracheostomy and diaphragmatic pacing and are more efficacious than drug treatments. Long-term compliance is generally much better in breathing disorders secondary to neurologic impairments than in cases of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder that describes repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to increased work of breathing, blood gas derangements, intrathoracic pressure swings, autonomic imbalances, and fragmented sleep.Even though the body is undergoing many physiologic disturbances (measured in exquisite detail over many hours), we continue to define the disease by one metric-the apneahypopnea index, or AHI.The AHI quantifies the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, regardless of associated hypoxemia, hypercarbia, arousals, hemodynamic changes, etc.An AHI ≥ 5 events/h diagnoses OSA, and an AHI ≥ 30 events/h arguably arbitrarily defines \"severe OSA\".However, as anyone who reads sleep studies appreciates, not all apneas or hypopneas are the same (between individuals or even within an single night; Figure 1).By distilling OSA into this single metric, we disregard other potentially impactful disease characteristics, such as event duration, hypoxemia burden, arousal intensity, heart rate variability, sleep stage, or body position dependence.][5] Several studies have attempted to identify polysomnographic traits that may better predict cardiovascular disease.For example, Oldenburg et al 6 showed the amount of total sleep time with SpO 2 < 90% (TST90) better predicted all-cause mortality in OSA patients with heart failure even after adjustment for confounding factors.In their study, the risk of death increased by 16% for every hour of TST90.Azarbarzin et al 7 computed a measurement of \"hypoxic burden\" by measuring the area under the oxygen desaturation curve during an obstructive event.They found that hypoxic burden from OSA was better than AHI at predicting cardiovascular endpoints.Butler et al 8 found that shorter duration of obstructive events predicted allcause mortality over and beyond that predicted by the AHI.Event duration is a heritable trait reflecting arousability.Those who tend to have shorter obstructive events may be prone to greater sleep fragmentation and sympathetic activity, which are detrimental to cardiovascular health.Finally, data is amassing to suggest that the pathogenesis and sequelae of OSA are sleep-stage dependent.Obstructive events during",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is caused by the repetitive closure of the pharynx during sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and, often, daytime somnolence. Traditionally, it is defined as either the number of apnoeas (complete cessation of breathing for longer than 10 seconds) or hyponoeas (reduction in air flow by &gt;50%) per hour in an overnight sleep study. However, it must be remembered that this definition is arbitrary, and OSA is better viewed as a spectrum with trivial snoring at one end and severe, almost continuous obstruction at the other. In addition to the sleep-study findings, if the patient is sleepy during the day, as defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, then this condition is termed ‘obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome’. This distinction is important, as patients with this syndrome usually warrant treatment.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia patients present with a consistent set of complaints that they generally report as secondary to their poor sleep, including increased tension/confusion, decreased vigor, personality disturbance, subjective overestimation of poor sleep, increased body temperature, increased 24-hour whole-body metabolic rate, and longer MSLT latencies. If there is a relationship between the poor sleep and the secondary symptoms, then particularly poor sleep should exacerbate those symptoms. Ten patients with insomnia were identified on the basis of a 2-night screening protocol, then slept in the laboratory for 10 additional nights. On 7 of the nights, the insomnia patients had their wake-after-sleep-onset increased so that their total sleep time was 80% of that on their second screening night, resulting in an average of 254 minutes (of 480 minutes in bed) of sleep. The spectrum of changes seen in these patients with insomnia who had very poor sleep for a week was characteristic of mild partial sleep deprivation, and not consistent with exacerbation of symptoms found in patients with primary insomnia. Specifically, (1) these patients had a reduction as opposed to an increase in the MSLT values, but the MSLT values at the end of the week remained within normal limits; (2) these patients had decreased (as opposed to increased) whole metabolic rate following nights of particularly poor sleep; (3) these patients tended to underestimate (rather than overestimate) their subjective sleep latency while being given particularly poor sleep; and (4) these patients displayed no significant change in body temperature, subjective anxiety, or MMPI scores following particularly poor sleep. It was concluded that the secondary symptoms reported by patients with primary insomnia are probably not related to their poor sleep per se. Data from previous studies that varied physiological arousal were used to support the contention that the secondary symptoms of patients with insomnia, and perhaps the poor sleep itself, occur secondary to central nervous system hyperarousal.",

Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "In addition to the excessive sleepiness associated with insufficient sleep, psychotropic medication or alcohol intake, sleep-related breathing disorders, primary hypersomnia, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and recurrent hypersomnia, it is important to be able to recognise excessive daytime sleepiness in association with a number of organic and psychological illnesses. Although excessive sleepiness may sometimes be the presenting feature, it is far more likely to be recognised as such during the course of the illness, either when interviewing a member of the family or as a result of observing the patient in hospital.",

      "abstract": "Il sonno copre circa un terzo del tempo totale della vita di ognuno. In questi ultimi anni e notevolmente aumentato l’interesse, sia a livello clinico che di ricerca, riguardo al sonno e alle patologie e ai disturbi ad esso correlati. In particolare, numerose ricerche dimostrano che la qualita del sonno ha un fortissimo impatto sulla qualita della vita e un sonno “disturbato” costituisce un fattore di rischio per numerose patologie. Quindi l’interesse e rivolto non solo a monitorare l’insorgere di patologie del sonno (quali apnee notturne, insonnia, ecc, ) ma anche insufficienza cardiaca, e patologie psichiatriche, quali i disturbi bipolari, sui quali la qualita’ del sonno ha un forte impatto e conseguenze a livello clinico. Il sonno inoltre e una condizione che consente il monitoraggio in modo continuativo in condizioni con elevato grado di ripetibilita, in quanto numerosi fattori esterni e non controllabili presenti durante il giorno, non sono presenti durante il periodo di sonno. Tutto questo giustifica la nascita di numerosi sensori e dispositivi per il monitoraggio domiciliare del sonno, in alternativa alla polisonnografia utilizzata invece a livello clinico e all’interno di specifici reparti ospedalieri. In questo lavoro di tesi vengono presi in considerazione due tipologie di sensori: una maglietta sensorizzata che permette di acquisire ECG, respiro e movimenti mediante un accelerometro triassiale, ed un materasso sensorizzato che registra il ballistocardiogramma (BCG) da cui si ottengono: serie RR (cioe le durate dei singoli cicli cardiaci, i movimenti respiratorio e i movimenti corporei. Lo scopo dello studio e creare un sistema che, a partire dai segnali registrati, possa fornire informazioni sulla qualita del sonno e riesca ad identificare ed a quantificare la presenza di alcuni eventi che possono verificarsi durante il periodo di sonno e sono correlabili alla presenza di patologie. La parte principale dello studio e rivolta alla validazione dei dispositivi utilizzati e allo sviluppo di metodologie specifiche di analisi e classificazione dei segnali, al fine di consentire una valutazione automatica delle registrazioni. In particolare, sono stati sviluppati metodi per la classificazione degli stadi del sonno, l’identificazione di eventi cardiovascolari e respiratori, la classificazione degli stati emotivi (con particolare riferimento al disordine bipolare). I metodi sviluppati sono stati validati su casistiche di soggetti di controllo e su soggetti patologici e hanno dimostrato l’efficacia delle metodiche implementate. Nuovi parametri verranno introdotti e testati e le procedure verranno rese completamente automatiche al fine di facilitare l’utilizza domiciliare da parte di utilizzatori che non abbiamo una specifica preparazione.",

A report of a 59-year-old patient with SRPE is described. Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation. Attempts to treat this condition with muscle relaxants or anxiolytics did not prompt an improvement of this disorder, but a single daily dose of gabapentin 300 mg in combination with 1 mg clonazepam at bedtime improved total sleep time and reduced full sleep erections.",

      "abstract": "An electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded after sleep deprivation (SDEEG) in epilepsy patients often discloses epileptiform discharges (ED) when routine EEG (REEG) does not, but since sleep alone activates ED, activation during SDEEG may result merely from the induction of sleep. We retrospectively investigated whether SDEEG is useful when REEG containing wakefulness and sleep fails to show ED. Subjects were patients with definite or highly probable epilepsy whose REEG lacked ED and who later underwent SDEEG. All had wakefulness and at least stage II sleep during both REEG and SDEEG. Patients with ED on REEG were specifically excluded to avoid including patients with activation due merely to the occurrence of sleep. Patient and EEG characteristics were studied, including duration of wakefulness and each sleep stage and timing and characteristics of ED. Fifteen of 29 patients(52%) had activation on SDEEG; exclusively during wakefulness in 1, exclusively during sleep in 6 and in both wakefulness and sleep in 8. Activation rates were not significantly different between wakefulness (9, 60%), stage I (11, 74%) and stage II (11, 74%). EEG characteristics were similar for REEG and SDEEG, except that total EEG duration and stage II sleep were longer in SDEEG than in REEG, which did not influence activation by a logistic regression model (p > 0.05). We conclude that sleep deprivation activates ED independent of the activating effects of sleep and therefore is useful in evaluation of suspected epilepsy even when REEG contains sleep.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

The diagnosis requires confirmation of sleepiness or increased sleep propensity via actigraphy, polysomnography, and/or multiple sleep latency test. Clinical evaluation, sleep diagnostics, and laboratory testing must exclude other disorders of excessive sleepiness.

Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "Sleep neuroscience is a rapidly expanding discipline. The many functions of sleep are still being characterized, and it is clear that sleep is not a passive state but a dynamic condition during which memories are consolidated, restorative hormones are released, and neuronal excitability is modulated.1 Many clinical syndromes of sleep are intertwined with neurologic disorders. The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common. In one study, 2% to 4% of working adults had obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), defined as greater than five apneas or hypopneas per hour in association with daytime somnolence.2 2) Neurologic diseases …",

The disorders associated with behaviors while asleep (parasomnias) are: sleep terrors and sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder. Injury can result from behaviors that occur during sleep. The patient's ability to recall the episode depends partly on the type of the parasomnia (occurrence during non-REM versus REM sleep). The other sleep disorders are recurrent hypersomnia and insomnia. Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is another important cause of insomnia. RLS is thought to be related to periodic limb movement disorder and is characterized by lower extremity dysesthesias that occur at rest.",

      "abstract": "The stability of sleep was examined in two kinds of induced insomnia, namely after caffeine administration and after hypnotic drug withdrawal. The duration of each episode of any one sleep stage or any episode of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness was determined. After caffeine there was an increase in longer episodes of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but no significant change in the episode duration of any of the sleep stages. In the case of drug withdrawal there was no change in the episode duration of intervening wakefulness plus drowsiness, but there was a significant shortening of episode duration in sleep stages 2 and 3+4, with a similar trend for REM sleep episodes. Caffeine 'insomnia' thus seems characterized by increased stability of wakefulness, and hypnotic withdrawal 'insomnia' by decreased stability fo sleep. The type of analysis undertaken in this study could increase understanding of other types of insomnia.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Tools for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

      "title": "Contribution de l'analyse du signal vocal à la détection de l'état de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale",
      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

Systemic hypertension and most of the severe arrhythmias recorded during sleep were secondary to repetitive obstructive apnonea and were mediated through the autonomic nervous system. Sleep related elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure were not influenced by atropine or impaired autonomic functions. Upper airway sleep apnoea is sleep related; the type of sleep (REM or NREM) is critical in the appearance of abnormalities. The distinction between two patient subgroups (total sleep dependent and NREM sleep dependent) has haemodynamic, and possibly long-term, implications. Sleep apnoea syndrome should be looked for in pateints with the Shy-Drager syndrome.",

The main symptom of insomnia is insufficient sleep to carry out the full range of daily functions. The patient who sleeps for only 5 hours a night, but is not sleepy during the day, is a 'short sleeper' and not an insomniac. Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS.

      "abstract": "The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) includes a constellation of symptoms, most prominently excessive daytime somnolence and unrefreshing sleep, associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The periodic respiratory events constituting SDB may be complete cessation of airflow (apneas), reductions in airflow of various degree (hypopneas), increased respiratory \"effort\" events with no increase in airflow (flow limitation events), or a combination of these events occurring at various times during the sleep period. Unrefreshing sleep and excessive daytime somnolence are thought to be because of disruption of the normal sleep architecture from recurrent brief arousals associated with the respiratory events, usually resulting in reduced \"deep\" (slow wave) and rapid eye movement sleep. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation, often severe, usually accompanies the respiratory events and may be a major factor in the cardiovascular morbidity associated with OSAHS. However, this satisfyingly simple and logical construct for OSHAS is likely an oversimplification. The lack of universally accepted criteria for defining a specific disease entity and the lack of certainty about the causal relationship of the various types of respiratory events and associated arousals/desaturations with symptoms and the pathophysiological consequences, limit the understanding of the prevalence, risk factors, and natural history of clinically important SDB.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Periodic movements in sleep (PMS) are stereotyped, repetitive, nonepileptiform movements of the lower extremities. A total of 409 sleep disorder patients were studied with all-night polysomnogram recording, and 53 (13%) had PMS. Such movements occurred in a wide variety of sleep-wake disorders in addition to insomnia. The prevalence and magnitude of PMS were not statistically greater in patients with insomniac disorders than in those with syndromes of excessive daytime sleepiness or other sleep-wake disorders. The results suggest that although PMS is responsible for disturbed sleep in relatively few patients, chronic sleep-wake disturbance is associated with PMS and may lead to the development of these movements.",

Los factores de riesgo mas importantes para este trastorno son la obesidad y la edad. La obstruccion de la via aerea ocasiona sintomas como ronquido de gran intensidad, pausas en la respiracion o sensacion de ahogamiento durante el sueno. Por otra parte, se ha descrito en la literatura que el uso de benzodiacepinas empeora el ronquido y las pausas en la respiracion, por lo que podria incrementar la duracion y severidad del SAHOS. Reporte del caso: Mujer de 74 anos de edad que acude a consulta a la Clinica de Sueno de la UNAM por sintomatologia animica, y al interrogarla sobre otros trastornos del dormir refiere ronquido intenso, interrumpido por periodos de silencio y pausas en la respiracion, por lo que se le realizo polisomnografia nocturna dividida que arrojo el resultado de SAHOS grave. Discusion: El consumo de benzodiacepinas es muy frecuente en los adultos mayores. En este caso, la paciente llevaba ingiriendo 1.5 mg/dia de clonazepam durante 8 anos, por lo que podria haber empeorado el SAHOS. Conclusiones: La paciente tenia factores de riesgo para desarrollar el SAHOS. Es necesario estudiar mas la asociacion entre las benzodiacepinas y el empeoramiento del SAHOS",

Sleep paralysis by itself has been reported as occurring infrequently and many clinicians are uncertain of its significance. In contrast, sleep paralysis in conjunction with sleep attacks has been reported as a concomitant of narcolepsy. To further examine the incidence of sleep paralysis, the responses of 80 first-year medical students (69 men, 11 women) to a questionnaire were analyzed. Of the sample studied, 16.25% had experienced predormital, postdormital, or both types of sleep paralysis. These episodes occurred infrequently—only once or twice for most of these students. Reports of sleep paralysis were not associated with sleep attacks or cataplexy. These results support two previous studies which found that sleep paralysis alone occurs frequently among normals.",

OSAS disease, the prevalence of which varies between 0.9% and 1.9% in Turkey, is a serious health problem that occurs as a result of complete or partial obstruction of the respiratory tract during sleep, resulting in sleep disruption, poor quality sleep, paralysis and even death in sleep. Polysomnography signal recordings (PSG) obtained from sleep laboratories are used for the diagnosis of OSAS, which is related to factors such as the individual's age, gender, neck diameter, smoking-alcohol consumption, and the occurrence of other sleep disorders. Polysomnography is used in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders such as snoring, sleep apnea, parasomnia (abnormal behaviors during sleep), narcolepsy (sleep attacks that develop during the day) and restless legs syndrome. It allows recording various parameters such as brain waves, eye movements, heart and chest activity measurement, respiratory activities, and the amount of oxygen in the blood with the help of electrodes placed in different parts of the patient's body during night sleep. In this article, the performance of PSG signal data for the diagnosis of sleep apnea was examined on the basis of both signal parameters and the method used. First, feature extraction was made from PSG signals, then the feature vector was classified with Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Logistic Regression (LR).",

      "abstract": "The word “apnea” means literally \"without breath\", and thus “sleep apnea” means not breathing while sleeping. Normally, during sleep we do not have pauses in-between breaths. Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

An estimated 82% of men and 92% of women with moderate to severe OSA have not been diagnosed [3]. Sleep apnea events are defi ned as a complete cessation of breathing (apnea) or a marked reduction in airfl ow (hypopnea) during sleep, and are considered clinically relevant if they last more than 10 seconds. The episodes of apneas and hypopneas may persist for 30 to 60 seconds in some individuals. OSA is characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, often resulting in oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep. The classic daytime manifestation is excessive sleepiness, and other symptoms such as non-refreshing sleep, poor concentration, and fatigue are commonly reported [4]. OSA is a serious condition that diminishes the quality of life [5] and is also associated with many common comorbidities. Studies have documented an increased incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease in OSA patients [6,7]. It is estimated that the average life span of an untreated OSA patient is 58 years, much shorter than the average life spans of 78 years for men and 83 years for women [8].

Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

Sleep-related apnoeas could already be observed during daytime. Cardiopulmonary daytime diagnostics did not reveal any abnormal findings. Polysomnographic measurements, however, showed an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 37.8 apnoeas/hypopnoeas per hour with predominantly central apnoeas. Pernasal application of 1 litre of oxygen per minute during sleep normalised breathing patterns, daytime sleepiness, and the nighttime states of confusion stopped.

      "abstract": "There are different forms of sleep apnea, each with different causes. Fortunately, they are all treatable. 1] Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways relax and become blocked during sleep. It is often accompanied by loud snoring or snorting. OSA is the most common form of sleep apnea, 2] Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain stops sending signals to the respiratory muscles while sleeping. Although the airways remain open, breathing stops. CSA is less common than OSA, 3] Mixed sleep apnea is a combination of central and obstructive sleep apnea, and Common to all of these disorders is the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas. Apnea is when the muscles and soft tissues in the upper airways slacken and collapse to the point that they are completely blocked for 10 seconds or more. Hypopnea is a partial blockage of the airways that decreases airflow by more than 50% for 10 seconds or more.",

      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Sleep apnoea: from numbers to the people",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is defined as the presence of more than five events of complete obstruction (apnoea) or partial obstruction (hypopnoea) of the pharynx [apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) >5] per hour of sleep. Amongst adults, more than 24% of men and 9% of women suffer from OSA each night 1. When a patient with OSA presents daytime sleepiness that affects work or social activity, OSA syndrome is diagnosed. Almost all patients with OSA snore and experience unrefreshed sleep but tend not to consult their general practitioner (GP) regarding this symptomatology. In most cases, patients visit their doctor at the request of their partner who has observed cessation of breathing during sleep or inappropriate DS. Overall, OSA is underdiagnosed and therefore undertreated. Despite this, it is currently a very common cause of GP consultation. The high prevalence of OSA in the industrialized world is related to the increasing prevalence of its main risk factor: obesity. Excessive fat deposit in the pharynx reduces the diameter of the upper airway and favours its collapse during sleep, when the tone of the intrinsic muscles of the pharynx is reduced compared to wake time. The immediate health consequences of undiagnosed and untreated OSA, that is occupational or traffic accidents and reduced neurocognitive performance, are due to sleep deprivation. During the night, patients with OSA suffer intermittent hypoxaemia and acute autonomic arterial and haemodynamic changes. In the long term, these changes induce a permanent state of oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability and insulin resistance. Therefore it is not surprising that many epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between OSA and increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality 2-5 and, more recently, increased risk of neoplasms 6. In this issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine 7, Lamberts et al. used the nationwide database of the entire Danish population to evaluate the role of sleep apnoea and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on the incidence rate of stroke and the incidence rate of myocardial infarction (MI). Three main conclusions were presented by the authors: (i) a diagnosis of ‘sleep apnoea’ was associated with an increased risk of stroke and MI; (ii) this risk was especially significant for subjects under 50 years of age; and (iii) there was no reduction in the risk of stroke and MI, relative to the general population, in patients who had been prescribed CPAP. The Danish nationwide database has the advantage of including health data and follow-up of all citizens regardless of the type of medical care they receive. However, the information obtained depends only on diagnoses and treatments reported by the healthcare system. The authors acknowledge multiple limitations of such population studies to establish association between a specific disease and its health outcomes. In the case of sleep apnoea, there are other limitations that should be considered. According to Lamberts et al., less than 1% of the Danish population is diagnosed with ‘sleep apnoea’ and, because results of sleep studies were not presented, the proportion of patients with central sleep apnoea or OSA, or the severity of these conditions, is unknown. The use of the undiagnosed sleep apnoea population as a reference for establishing the risk of CV events is problematic as most Danish individuals with sleep apnoea that are not diagnosed and are in fact included in the ‘control group’ therefore sets a selection bias that underestimates the risk of developing health outcomes amongst subjects diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Amongst patients treated with CPAP, the degree of adherence to therapy (e.g. number of hours of use per day) is unknown. On the other hand, assuming that the range of severity of OSA obtained by the authors in the validation cohort is the same as in the general population, more than 48% and 89% of patients with mild and moderate OSA, respectively, are treated with CPAP in Denmark. It is not surprising that more than 30% of patients discontinue treatment as it is well known that patients with less severe OSA are less compliant with CPAP therapy. In other health systems, the indication for CPAP therapy is confined to patients with severe (AHI >30) or moderate OSA (AHI >15) with DS 8, 9. The health benefit of CPAP treatment appears to be limited to patients with severe OSA and with good adherence (>4 h of daily use) 2, 10. Finally, the authors compared the protective effect of CPAP therapy on CV morbidity in patients treated with CPAP and the general population, which includes subjects with undiagnosed sleep apnoea but mainly individuals without this disorder. Taken together, these limitations could have attenuated the differences in treatment effect on evaluated outcomes. In summary, the findings of Lamberts et al. support the common belief that OSA is an independent CV disease risk factor but do not exclude the possibility of a protective effect of CPAP therapy to eliminate this increased risk. The causal relationship between OSA and cardiovascular morbidity may be established only by large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted over a long period of time. Such studies are unlikely as CPAP therapy is so effective in patients with symptomatic OSA that for ethical reasons they cannot be denied this treatment. At present, there is strong evidence from RCTs of a causal relationship between OSA and markers of risk of CV events such as hypertension. In addition, in a recent RCT, it was found that in OSA without DS, patients with worse sleep apnoea and with CPAP adherence of <4 h/night showed a higher rate of incident hypertension or CV events compared to those who used CPAP for more than >4 h/night 10. Large RCTs are not always feasible. In addition to ethical and safety issues with regard to treatment allocation for OSA patients, RCTs require a long period of time in which clinical equipoise may exist, are expensive and have limited generalizability. In the meantime, good clinical and community-based studies, such as this study by Lamberts et al., can improve understanding about disease outcomes and therapy. The work of Lamberts et al., amongst other studies, confirms the importance of OSA as a global public health concern. It is unclear which patients with OSA are more likely to develop CV or metabolic disorders. It is possible that in addition to the severity of the disease, other factors such as sensitivity to intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation or epigenetic modifications in regulatory genes involved in accelerated atherosclerosis contribute to worsen the prognosis of patients with OSA 11. Meanwhilst, in the absence of widely accepted and validated guidelines, management of patients with suspected OSA should be based on minimum criteria such degree of daytime sleepiness evaluated by appropriated questionnaires and adequate examination of the upper airway, accurate diagnosis using validated sleep studies and discussion with the patient of the best available therapies. CPAP therapy is still the primary treatment of OSA, and therapeutic pressure should be individualized by a second sleep study or at home autotitration of CPAP. This treatment should be reserved for patients with DS and for those with severe OSA with or without DS (Fig. 1). Treatment adherence should be assessed periodically and, as for any patient with OSA, must be accompanied by abstention from smoking, alcohol consumption and use of sleeping pills and by active measures to reduce obesity including surgery, if necessary.

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "title": "Review article on sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that involves a reduces or complete halt in airflow despite an ongoing effort to breathe. It occurs when the muscles relax during sleep, causing soft tissue in the back of the throat to collapse and block the upper airway. This results in partial reductions (hypopneas) and complete block (apneas) in breathing that lasts a minimum of 10 seconds during sleep. Most pauses last between 10 and 30 seconds, but some may persist for one minute or longer. This can cause abrupt reductions in blood oxygen saturation. The brain responds to the lack of oxygen by alerting the body, causing a brief arousal from sleep that restores normal breathing. This pattern can occur many times in one night. The result is a fragmented quality of sleep that often produces an excessive level of daytime sleepiness. Most people with OSA snore loudly and regullarly, with periods of silence when airflow is reduced or blocked. They then make choking, snorting or gasping sounds when their airway reopens. A common measurement of sleep apnea is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "abstract": "The passage from trivial snoring to heavy snorer's disease or obstructive apnea syndrome is a subtle and gradual process. The suspect clinical signs of this process are primarily the onset of intermittent snoring and daytime sleepiness. We propose a diagnostic assessment based on objective monitoring of respiratory behaviour (noise of snoring, endothoracic pressure, SaO2) during sleep and the tendency to daytime drowsiness (by means of the so-called multiple sleep latency test, MSLT). These parameters establish not only the presence of a disease state, but also give a fairly accurate indication of the different stages of the disease. The nocturnal respiratory pattern emerging from this objective assessment can be divided into four stages: stage 0 (or preclinical), with sporadic obstructive apneas; stage I (or initial), with obstructive apneas persisting during light (st. 1-2) and REM sleep; stage II (or overt), with obstructive apneas persisting for the whole length of sleep; stage III (or complicated), with alveolar hypoventilation persisting during wakefulness. In stage 0, episodes of O2 desaturation are sporadically present and linked to obstructive apneas or hypopneas. In stages I-II, phasic desaturations are correlated with the apneas. In stage II and above all stage III, phasic desaturation is associated with persistent falls of Sao2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "1000 Hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy and Parkinson’s disease (PD) share many similar symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, with or without cataplexy. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur while falling asleep and the person experiencing them typically knows they are not real. Here, we present a case of hypnagogic hallucinations as a manifestation of PD in a patient without narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 66-year-old female with a history of tremor was seen in the sleep disorders clinic with chief complaints of dream enactment and excessive daytime sleepiness. She described bruising after falling out of bed. On further questioning, she reported instances of seeing “death and a grim reaper as well as a dark figure”, usually upon falling asleep at night. She denied daytime hallucinations. She underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), which showed mild obstructive sleep apnea and loss of rapid eye movement (REM) atonia during brief periods of REM sleep. Treatment for dream enactment was implemented by increasing her dose of melatonin (which she had been taking for insomnia) and initiation of clonazepam, which led to significant improvement in dream enactment. Over the next two years, she was diagnosed with PD and started on carbidopa-levodopa. She reported more frequent hypnagogic hallucinations during a follow-up visit, occurring 1-2 times weekly, which her neurologist attributed to being on higher dosages of dopaminergic therapy. During a recent visit, she reported no dream enactment and infrequent hypnagogic hallucinations. Conclusion Sleep disturbances in PD are common and include insomnia, hypersomnia, and REM behavioral disorder (RBD). A lesser appreciated association is that between hypnagogic hallucinations and PD, as depicted in this case. Partial hypocretin cell loss in PD has been postulated to result in disturbed hypocretin signaling, which probably explains the occurrence of narcolepsy-like symptoms (including hypnagogic hallucinations) in PD. Hypnagogic hallucinations are more common among patients with PD compared to the general population and tend to occur more as PD progresses, with longer duration of treatment with dopaminergic agents, with older age, and in patients with RBD. This case serves as an important reminder that hypnagogic hallucinations are not pathognomonic for narcolepsy and are likely underappreciated in PD. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), or Obstructive Sleep Apnea -OSA, is characterized by sleep disturbances secondary to upper airway obstruction. OSAHS is prevalent in two to four percent of middle-aged adults, and has been associated with daytime somnolence, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities, and increased likelihood of accidents and other adverse outcomes. The prevalence of OSAHS in older adults (65 years or older) is believed to be higher than the aforementioned estimates, but it is not as well studied. In fact, there are contradictory data suggesting that OSAHS prevalence levels off after the age of 65 years; a plausible explanation is that fewer new cases are identified among older adults. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the commonly used treatment (additional interventions exist, but are not used or indicated in the majority of patients).The reference standard for the diagnosis of OSAHS is facility-based polysomnography (PSG), a comprehensive sleep study that records and evaluates a variety of cardiorespiratory and neurophysiologic signals during sleep time. It quantifies the severity of disturbances with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). Higher AHI values imply more severe sleep disturbances. Typically, a value of 15 events/hour of sleep or more is considered to be suggestive of OSAHS. Note that an AHI suggestive of OSAHS is not sufficient for the diagnosis of the condition, as the severity of symptoms has to be accounted for, and other conditions affecting sleep may need to be excluded.Portable monitors have been developed in an effort to substitute for the more costly facility-based PSG. According to the data recorded, monitors are classified into different categories. Facility-based PSG is a type I monitor. Type II portable monitors record the same data as facility-based PSG, albeit using fewer channels. Type III portable monitors are less comprehensive, since they do not record neurophysiologic sleep staging information. Type IV portable monitors are those that fail to meet criteria for type III devices (i.e., they do not record at least two respiratory channels).This technology assessment is based on a systematic review of the literature. In total 95 studies were included. Eligible studies assess the ability of sleep studies at baseline to predict response to CPAP treatment or CPAP use; the comparison of measurements with portable monitors and facility-based PSG; and the safety of sleep studies. We note that the current technology assessment focuses on adult patients, and did not consider pediatric populations.",

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

Approximately 4 percent of adult men and 2 percent of adult women are believed to have these conditions. In addition to having symptoms such as snoring, headaches, depression, decreased libido and fatigue, patients with sleep apnea are at risk for a range of severe complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep.

      "title": "Nasal dilator for management of sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Sleep disorders are commonly caused by nasal obstruction. Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

      "title": "Evaluation of pathological sleepiness by M ultiple S leep L atency T est and 24‐hour polysomnography in patients suspected of idiopathic hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Sleepiness is considered not to be unidimensional. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3) employs two criteria for 'pathological sleepiness' for idiopathic hypersomnia: (i) sleep prolongation with a 24-h total sleep time (TST) ≥ 660 min, measured either by 24-h polysomnography (24-h PSG) or by wrist-actigraphy-based sleep time averaged for at least 7 days; and high sleep propensity with a mean sleep latency (mSL) of ≤8 min on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).1 The MSLT evaluates the tendency to fall asleep during daytime nap opportunities and serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis of central disorders of hypersomnolence. However, recent studies indicate that the MSLT is inadequate to delineate hypersomnia other than narcolepsy type 1.2-4 Although several attempts using continuous PSG monitoring have been performed,5-7 appropriate markers for idiopathic hypersomnia have not been established.8 We performed 24-h PSG, standard PSG, and MSLT to understand the difference between the two aspects of sleepiness. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Institute of Neuropsychiatry and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. All patients gave written informed consent. Forty consecutive patients visiting Seiwa Hospital with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time were evaluated by 3-day sleep studies – unattended 24-h PSG, followed by PSG and MSLT – from January 2017 to June 2019. Clinical and PSG variables from 35 eligible patients were compared to search for markers of pathological sleepiness. Our patients turned out to share clinical symptoms characteristic of idiopathic hypersomnia. (Detailed methods and characteristics of our patients are provided in Supplementary Information, Table S1.) Twenty-nine of 35 patients were confirmed to have pathological sleepiness as determined either with 24-h PSG TST ≥ 660 min (27 patients) or MSLT mSL ≤ 8 min (six patients). Only four patients met both criteria, indicating that pathological sleepiness determined with 24-h PSG and MSLT reflected different aspects of sleepiness (see Supplementary Fig. S1). We next searched for markers characteristic of patients with sleep prolongation or high sleep propensity. There were no differences in demographic data, self-reported measures, or clinical symptoms except for higher percentage of 'always unrefreshed nap' in those with sleep prolongation and higher percentage of 'experience of sleep attack' and lower percentage of 'long nap' in those with high sleep propensity (Table S1). As expected, we confirmed shorter MSLT mSL in the high-sleep-propensity group and longer 24-h PSG TST in the sleep-prolongation group (Table 1). No conventional PSG variables predicted sleep prolongation. Some sleep variables on 24-h PSG were identified as possible markers for sleep prolongation: shortened REM latency (P = 0.026), lower 24-h PSG_N3 (%TST; P = 0.020), more non rapid eye movement (NREM)-REM cycle counts (P = 0.0002), and shorter NREM-REM cycle duration (P = 0.046). Binary logistic regression analyses confirmed that a symptom of 'always unrefreshed upon waking' (odds ratio [OR] 44.1, P = 0.021), 24-h PSG REM latency (OR 1.009, P = 0.027), and 24-h PSG NREM-REM cycle duration (OR 1.07, P = 0.06) were independent predictors of pathological sleep prolongation. Similar analyses revealed that a symptom of 'experience of sleep attack' was independently associated with high sleep propensity (OR 0.11, P = 0.023). (See Table S2. Detailed description for Table 1 and S2 are provided in Supplementary Information.) Twenty-five of the 35 patients fulfilled the ICSD-3 criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia, two with narcolepsy type 2, two with pathological sleepiness without a diagnosis (sleep prolongation with multiple sleep-onset REM periods [SOREMP]), and six with non-hypersomnia. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of two tests for the diagnosis of ICSD-3-defined idiopathic hypersomnia were calculated. Test sensitivity was 12% with MSLT and 92% with 24-h PSG, test specificity was 80% and 60%, and accuracy was 34% and 83%, respectively (Table S3). The low sensitivity and accuracy of MSLT may be partly due to the sampling bias because we performed 24-h PSG only for those with habitually long self-reported sleep time. However, our results indicated that 79% (23/29) of our patients with pathological sleepiness would be overlooked if they were evaluated with MSLT alone, replicating that idiopathic hypersomnia patients often fail to show high sleep propensity.1, 6, 9, 10 Although the presence of multiple SOREMP reflects the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, there is no evidence that their absence is related to the pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia. In this study, four of 27 (14.8%) patients with pathological sleep prolongation showed multiple SOREMP on MSLT. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to clarify the significance of SOREMP and other REM abnormalities in those with sleep prolongation. (REM abnormality and limitations of this study are described in detail in Supplementary Information.) Our study indicates that the two aspects of sleepiness, sleep prolongation and high sleep propensity, are fundamentally different, and that 24-h PSG should be used as a first-line diagnostic tool for idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time. We would like to thank all the patients who participated in this study. We would also like to thank the nursing staff at Seiwa Hospital for handling blood samples and Ms Megumi Hazumi for obtaining informed consent.

Supplementary Information S1. Detailed methods, characteristics of our subjects, markers for the pathological sleepiness, REM abnormality in those with sleep prolongation, limitation and references. Figure S1. Representative 24-h polysomnography (PSG) hypnograms of patients in the three subtypes. Representative 24-h PSG hypnograms are shown with the time series variation of position sensors. L, S, R, and U in the position sensor indicated that the patients were in left lateral decubitus, supine, right lateral decubitus, and upright positions, respectively. The bottom line in the position sensor (U) indicates that the participant was in the upright position. Table S1. Clinical characteristics of patients. Demographic data, self-reported measures, HLA-DQB1 status, and frequency of clinical symptoms related to idiopathic hypersomnia are listed. A higher percentage of those with sleep prolongation experienced a symptom of 'always unrefreshed upon waking (unrefreshed nap),' and a higher percentage of those with high sleep propensity had experience of a symptom of 'sleep attack.' Table S2. Logistic regression models. Table S2A: Logistic regression model for sleep prolongation. Binary logistic regression using a backward elimination approach was performed to identify predictors of sleep prolongation. The initial model included age, sex, BMI, and candidate variables identified in the bivariate analyses. Those with 'always unrefreshed upon waking from naps' had a 44-fold higher risk for pathological sleep prolongation. This final model had good Nagelkerke's R square value. Table S2B: Logistic regression model for high sleep propensity. Similar logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of high sleep propensity. The initial model included age, sex, BMI, and two symptoms: long nap >30min and the experience of sleep attack. Those with the experience of sleep attack had a 0.104-fold lower risk (that is, a 9.6-fold higher risk) for high sleep propensity. Only sleep attack remained in the final model with low Nagelkerke's R square value. Table S3. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and 24-h polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. The results of total sleep time (TST) on 24-h PSG and mean sleep latency (mSL) on MSLT, a marker for pathological sleepiness, were tabulated against the final diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition (ICSD-3) criteria. Test sensitivity and accuracy were higher with 24-h PSG, indicating that 24-h PSG was a better diagnostic tool for our patients, who were suspected of idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time.

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

Disrupted sleep is among the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. The complaint of insomnia can also accompany parasomnias, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for sleep starts and nightmares (1).

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "title": "Disorders of Excessive Sleepiness: Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of complete and partial obstructions of the upper airway during sleep. The diagnosis of OSA requires the objective demonstration of abnormal breathing during sleep by measuring the respiratory disturbance index (RDI, events per hour of sleep), i.e. the frequency of apnea (complete upper airway obstruction), hypopnea (partial upper airway obstruction) and arousals from sleep related to respiratory efforts. OSA is defined by combining symptoms and an RDI ≥5 or by an RDI ≥15 without symptoms. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the frequency of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep, is widely used to define OSA (many clinical and epidemiological studies use this metric). In the general adult population, the prevalence of OSA defined by ≥5 apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep associated with excessive sleepiness is approximately 3-7% in men and 2-5% in women. The prevalence of OSA is much higher, e.g. ≥50%, in patients with cardiac or metabolic disorders than in the general population. Risk factors for OSA include obesity (the strongest risk factor), upper airway abnormalities, male gender, menopause and age (the prevalence of OSA associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality increases with age and peaks at approximately 55 years of age). OSA is associated with symptoms during sleep (snoring, choking and nocturia) and wakefulness (excessive sleepiness, fatigue and lack of energy) and with sequelae such as psychological changes, alterations in the quality of life, and social, familial and professional performance including vehicle and industrial accidents. The identification of OSA may be a difficult task for the clinician, even in populations in which OSA is highly prevalent such as patients with cardiovascular disorders because they may not present the cardinal signs of the disease, e.g. excessive sleepiness and obesity. Guidelines have been developed to tailor OSA therapy to patients according to the results of their disease evaluation and their preferences.",

      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

She slept 5.5 hours during video polysomnography, but the theta rhythm electroencephalograph recording typical of sleep stages 1 to 2 and the spindles and K-complexes typical of sleep stage 2 contrasted with continuous muscular twitching, prominent rapid eye movements, vocalizations, and continuous, complex, purposeful movements typical of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. This newly described stages 1--2 non-REM sleep behavior disorder suggests that central motor pattern generators were disinhibited during non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

In my experience, prolonged loss of consciousness lasting for several hours that is neither EDS nor ordinary sleep attacks can occur in PD patients and indeed seems to be a symptom unique to PD.<bold>Case presentation:</bold> Eight patients with PD are reported who showed episodes of loss of consciousness lasting for 4-24 h that appeared to be deep sleep or a coma, and could not be roused even by strong painful stimuli. After four hours or more, they spontaneously resumed consciousness without sequelae.<bold>Discussion and conclusions: </bold>According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders - Third edition (ICSD-3), “hypersomnia due to a medical disorder,” a synonym of EDS, and “narcolepsy, type 2”, a synonym of sleep attacks are the representatives of sleep disorder in PD. However, the diagnostic criteria of these two disorders in ICSD-3 differ from the prolonged loss of consciousness in my cases. As it has brought great concern to family members, medical staff, and emergent hospital personnel, we must pay more attention to this type of loss of consciousness.",

Despite these difficulties, two-thirds of patients rated sleep quality as acceptable or good. The average duration of sleep was 6.5-7 h but approximately 8% of patients reported less than 5 h sleep per night. Hypnotic or sedative drugs were used by 29% of patients to help them sleep but only 6% took any antiparkinsonian medication during the night. Just over half the patients had told their doctor of nocturnal problems; prescription of hypnotic drugs or changes to antiparkinsonian therapy were the remedies most frequently tried. Problems at night are common in PD and, because of their debilitating effect on performance during the daytime, merit special attention.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Eight patients with myotonic dystrophy underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and overnight polysomnography to assess whether the waking cognitive impairment might be attributable to sleep structure abnormalities or to sleep-related respiratory problems. Patients showed substantial neuropsychological deficits, fragmented nocturnal sleep and, in half the patients, sleep apnea and/or hypopnea both mainly of central type. There was no statistically significant correlation between the degree of daytime cognitive deficit and the degree of sleep fragmentation or of respiratory problems at night. It was concluded that the neuropsychological deficit in mytonic dystrophy cannot be attributed to a secondary effect of nocturnal sleep apnea or sleep disruption but probably represents a direct effect of CNS lesions.",

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

      "title": "Insomnia: Causes and Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

Destacamos a insônia, o bruxismo do sono e o sonambulismo. A insônia pode ser uma das queixas dos pacientes portadores de distúrbios respiratórios do sono, pela fragmentação do sono decorrente. Além disso, ambos podem trazer sérias repercussões na saúde como o aumento da morbidade cardiovascular e maior risco de acidentes automobilísticos e laborativos, como tem sido demonstrado nas duas ultimas décadas. O correto diagnóstico de insônia em pacientes com apnéia do sono, bem como de apnéia em pacientes com insônia define a metodologia propedêutica empregada e também o tratamento, como por exemplo, a abordagem farmacológica quando necessária e o tratamento do distúrbio respiratório concomitantemente. O bruxismo do sono pode estar presente em 3,5-14% dos pacientes com apnéia do sono. Na sua investigação clínica devemos sempre avaliar a possível presença da apnéia do sono já que para o seu tratamento muitas vezes é necessária a sua abordagem em primeiro lugar para então utilizarmos tratamentos farmacológicos e dispositivos que diminuam os danos às estruturas orofaciais.Dentre as parassonias que frequentemente acompanham a apnéia do sono temos o sonambulismo.Ele representa a presença de atividade motora típica da vigília durante estado do sono.Esse fenômeno torna-se mais freqüente quando ocorre fragmentação do sono, provocando dissociação das variáveis fisiológicas, como ocorre em indivíduos com distúrbios respiratórios do sono. Concluindo, é de suma importância o conhecimento e a identificação de outros distúrbios do sono que podem ocorrer como epifenômenos ou como conseqüência da apnéia obstrutiva do sono, pois tanto o tratamento dos mesmos pode, em alguns casos agravar a apnéia do sono, quanto o subdiagnóstico pode interferir na melhora clínica do paciente.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is still debated whether the deterioration of the sleep pattern, frequently reported by elderly subjects, is due only to aging per se. Other factors associated with aging or modifications of biological rhythms could also be involved. Elderly subjects frequently complain of daytime sleepiness, but it is not clear whether this actually represents a return to a polyphasic structure of sleep, or only a consequence of a disturbed night sleep. Ten healthy, independent and active elderly subjects (age > 72 years) were evaluated by means of 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography. Findings of nocturnal sleep were compared with sleep of the same group in the. 24-hour period and with sleep of young healthy controls. We observed a fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, but a fairly good representation of stages and a preservation of cyclicity. Except for three cases, with early or late times of sleep onset and wake-up, sleep disruption did not seem to be related to modification of circadian rhythms. Only three subjects presented undesired daytime naps, whereas the others either did not show daytime sleep at all, or were used to having their siesta after lunch since their young adulthood. In normal aging, daytime sleep does not constitute a social problem. Ambulatory polysomnography is a valid alternative to laboratory recordings in the identification of daytime sleep.Key Words: Sleepambulatory polysomnographynormal aging",

      "title": "What is sleep?",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are two distinct types of sleep—non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—a balance of which is needed to function well during the day. During the night, these two types of sleep alternate with each other. Probably everyone dreams but the purpose of dreaming is generally unclear. The pattern of wakefulness and sleep is controlled by an internal clock in the brain (the body clock). Your level of alertness varies within each 24 hours. The tendency to sleep is greatest in the early hours of the morning (corresponding to deep NREM sleep) and (although less so) in the early afternoon. People vary in the time of day when they are most alert: ‘larks’ in the morning and ‘owls’ in the evening. Most people show neither of these patterns. Daytime naps can make it difficult to get to sleep at bedtime if they are too long or too late in the day. Long naps can make you feel groggy afterwards. Sleep has some features in common with other states of relative inactivity, such as coma or, in some species, hibernation. All of these states usually occur while lying down with little movement and reduced awareness of the environment to varying degrees. However, sleep is very different from the rest.",

      "title": "Interactions Between Sleep and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleepis one of the best-documented factors influencing the expression of seizuresand interictal discharges. Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

Analysis reveals that nineteen (76%) of the patients were found to have clinically significant periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMs) by the second night of study. PLMs are associated with sleep complaints in normals. For this reason the common assumption that sleep complaints in posttraumatic stress disorder are related only to the psychiatric disorder itself are challenged.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

L’association avec les troubles du sommeil est décrite chez 25 % à 50 % des enfants et chez plus de la moitié des adultes présentant un TDA/H. La question de cette comorbidité pose question. En effet, Il n’est pas clair à l’heure actuelle si les troubles du sommeil sont intrinsèques au TDA/H ou s’ils se produisent à la suite d’un trouble primaire du sommeil sous-jacent. En effet, il est décrit des symptômes de « type TDA/H » dans certains troubles du sommeil primaires tels que les troubles respiratoires du sommeil, les mouvements périodiques des membres pendant le sommeil et le syndrome des jambes sans repos. De plus, la somnolence diurne excessive (l’un des symptômes de la narcolepsie et l’hypersomnie idiopathique) peut « mimer » des symptômes de TDA/H. Dès lors, la similitude de certains symptômes peut conduire à des erreurs diagnostiques entre troubles primaires du sommeil et TDA/H. Ainsi, nous nous proposons lors de ce symposium de faire un point sur les liens entre troubles du sommeil et TDA/H chez l’adulte : – en effectuant tout d’abord une revue de la littérature explorant la comorbidité entre ces différents troubles. Puis en présentant ensuite deux études originales sur ce thème en population adulte : – explorant d’une part, la comorbidité des hypersomnies (hypersomnie idiopathique et narcolepsie) chez les adultes TDA/H et la comorbidité TDA/H chez des adultes hypersomniaques ; – d’autre part, en explorant la somnolence diurne excessive objective par un test de maintien de l’éveil en population adulte TDA/H et l’impact de cette somnolence sur les performances de conduite des sujets (sur simulateur de conduite).",

We hypothesized this might be due to the exacerbation of an underlying sleep disorder, which we have previously demonstrated to exist.Female patients with CFS and matched healthy controls with no evidence of major depressive disorder were studied with overnight polysomnography on a baseline night and on a night after their performance of a maximal exercise test.CFS patients as a group had evidence for disturbed sleep compared with controls. Although exercise improved sleep for healthy subjects, it did not do this for the group as a whole. When we stratified the sample on the basis of self-reported sleepiness after a night's sleep, the patient group with reduced morning sleepiness showed improvement in sleep structure, whereas those with increased morning sleepiness continued to show evidence for sleep disruption.Sleep is disturbed in CFS patients as a group, but exercise does not exacerbate this sleep disturbance. Approximately half the patients studied actually sleep better after exercise. Therefore, activity-related symptom worsening is not caused by worsened sleep.",

Apart from factors not specifically related to pulmonary diseases (e.g. consequences of infections or malignant diseases of the lungs), increased work of breathing due to impaired lung/thoracic cage mechanics, the effects of chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, the consequences of disturbed sleep and psychosocial factors are mainly responsible for the impaired physical fitness and the fatigue in association with lung diseases. A careful case history including psychosocial aspects and a thorough physical examination are essential for an efficient diagnostic evaluation. Tests of pulmonary function not only in the awake patient at rest, but also during sleep or adequate physical exercise can reveal the causes of impaired physical performance and fatigue related to lung diseases.",

Dyspnea on exertion (DOE) may occur normally, but is considered indicative of disease when it occurs at a level of activity that is usually well tolerated. Dyspnea should be differentiated from tachypnea, hyperventilation, and hyperpnea, which refer to respiratory variations regardless of the patients subjective sensations. Tachypnea is an increase in the respiratory rate above normal; hyperventilation is increased minute ventilation relative to metabolic need, and hyperpnea is a disproportionate rise in minute ventilation relative to an increase in metabolic level. These conditions may not always be associated with dyspnea.Orthopnea is the sensation of breathlessness in the recumbent position, relieved by sitting or standing. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a sensation of shortness of breath that awakens the patient, often after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, and is usually relieved in the upright position.Two uncommon types of breathlessness are trepopnea and platypnea. Trepopnea is dyspnea that occurs in one lateral decubitus position as opposed to the other. Platypnea refers to breathlessness that occurs in the upright position and is relieved with recumbency.",

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

After two decades or more of sleep research and sleep medicine, insomnia is considered a distinct nosological entity. Perhaps what is different in the modern era is that initially the distinction between primary insomnia and secondary insomnia allowed for difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep to be both a disorder in its own right and symptom of other disorders, while the most recent international classification of sleep disorders divides up the category of insomnia into 11 diagnostic entities based on etiological and pathophysiological criteria. Thus, it is no longer either a symptom (secondary) or a diagnosis (primary) but both. This is a more accurate definition especially given the large proportion of insomniacs with comorbid medical conditions, the most common being psychiatric illnesses. We are fortunate to have several nosologies that recognize insomnia as a primary disorder. The various classification systems provide us the wherewithal to differentiate types of insomnia both by presenting complaint as well as by the factors that are thought to precipitate or perpetuate the illness.",

Data Sources: Revision of the relevant medical literature, research in “MEDLINE” for the period between 1976 and 2004. Textbook chapters were also consulted. Summary: The sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome is a breathing disorder during the sleep characterized by partial prolonged obstruction of the upper airway and/or intermittent complete obstruction, which interrupts the normal breathing ventilation and sleep standards. The difficulties of gas exchange occurring during sleep constitute a spectrum of diseases which varies, in increasing severity, from primary snoring to sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome with severe complications and death risk. Conclusions: During the pediatric routine clinic visit, an item of the anamnesis that should be always present is whether the child snores during the night; in case a history of snoring is found, a more detailed anamnesis, mainly with regard to the existence of signs and/or symptoms of difficult breathing, must be carried out.",

The recommendations include: (1) Sleep as well as psychiatric disorders tend to become prevalent in more complex and severe headache patterns and regulation of sleep and mood may favorably impact headache threshold; (2) Specific headache patterns, irrespective of headache diagnosis, are suggestive of a potential sleep disorder (eg, “awakening” or morning headache, chronic daily headache); (3) Sleep disorders most implicated with headache include obstructive sleep apnea, primary insomnia, and circadian phase abnormalities, and treatment of such sleep disorders may improve or resolve headache; (4) Inexpensive screening tools (eg, sleep history interview, headache/sleep diary, validated questionnaires, prediction equations) aid identification of patients warranting polysomnography; and (5) Pharmacologic and behavioral therapies are effective in the regulation of sleep and are compatible with usual headache care.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease characterized by widespread pain accompanied by sleep disorders, affective impairments, chronic fatigue, functional deficiency and emotional disorders. Sleep disorders in FMS patients have been widely reported in literature. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a syndrome characterized by repeated periods of upper respiratory tract obstruction and frequently a reduction in blood oxygen saturation during sleep. To make a diagnosis and define severity with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), it is necessary to conduct a polysomnography (PSG) study throughout the night. OSAS cases suffer from frequent sleep disruption, are unable to enter the deep sleep phase and cannot physically rest. Therefore, as both OSAS and FMS cases have sleep disorders with symptoms such as a need for daytime sleep and headaches in the morning, it is thought that there may be a relationship between OSAS and FMS. The case is here presented of a 43-year old female FMS patient with symptoms including an 8-year history of widespread pain and fatigue, inability to get up in the mornings, excessive sleepiness during the day and snoring, who was determined with moderate level OSAS as a result of polysomnography examination.",

      "abstract": "Numerious studies conducted over the last 40 years assessing different physiological domains including autonomic nervous system status, whole body and brain metabolic rate, stress and immune system activity suggest that (1) insomnia is a disorder of physiologic hyperarousal present throughout 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, and (2) insomnia and sleep loss are two distinct states. Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

It is brought on by a partial or total blockage of the upper airway, which results in apnea or hypopnea. Soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses and blocks the upper airway when muscles relax while you sleep. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is a widely used metric to quantify sleep apnea. The total number of apneas and hypopneas that happen during an hour of sleep is represented by this average. The majority of people with OSA remain undiagnosed, even with the recent advancements in sleep medicine diagnostic technologies and public awareness of the condition. The upper airway imaging methods for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be covered in this review.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

Respiratory studies during sleep were performed in 14 of these patients with additional features such as disturbed sleep, observed apnoea during sleep, morning headache, mental and personality changes, hypertension and cardiac failure. Nocturnal respiratory studies undertaken for periods of 4–8 hours confirmed a diagnosis of the Sleep Apnoea Syndrome in eight patients. In these patients apnoeas, lasting from 30–144 seconds, occurred frequently during sleep (from 35–291 episodes per patient). In one severely affected patient, tracheostomy abolished all symptoms. The use of conservative therapy such as weight loss, protriptyline or a neck collar, highlighted the inadequacies of current medical treatment. Awareness of the symptom complex and potential complications of the Sleep Apnoea Syndrome is important because the diagnosis may easily be missed if the patient presents with one or two isolated complaints.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Excessive sleepiness or hypersomnolence is currently defined by two main symptoms: 1) the excessive amount of sleep, defined as a prolonged period of main sleep or the presence of naps; and 2) poor quality of awakening. Excessive sleepiness was reported by 27.8%. The presence of recurrent periods of irresistible sleep in the same day was found in 13.2%, recurrent naps in the same day in 1.9%, non-restorative sleep despite a nighttime sleep of more than 9 hours (0.7%), as well as a sleep drunkenness (4.4%). Adding criteria for duration and frequency (minimum of 3 times per week and duration of at least 3 months), having social or professional impairment and psychological distress, and after excluding significant associated comorbidities, the prevalence fall to 1.5%. These very important prevalence hypersomnolence figures constitute an excellent argument to educate doctors and health authorities on the need to identify and support the excessive sleepiness disorders.",

Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Novel mHealth and multimodal physiological biomarkers for non-invasive monitoring and home healthcare of obstructive sleep apnea and COPD patients with comorbidities",
      "abstract": "(English) Sleep is a physiological state of rest that occupies one-third of a person’s daily activity and has health consequences. Poor sleep disrupts concentration and productivity and increases the odds of developing multiple health complications. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease affecting sleep quality and is characterized by the appearance of episodes of total or partial occlusion of the airways. This altered breathing pattern can lead to hypoxia, which rises the probability to develop cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. OSA can be worsened by comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and is haracterized by persistent inflammation of the airways affecting the gas exchange in the lungs. OSA and COPD can occur together as the OSA-COPD overlap syndrome. The gold standard technique for the diagnosis of sleep-related diseases is polysomnography (PSG), which measures multiple physiological variables. However, PSG has some limitations: high cost, altered sleep behavior due to sleeping in a different environment, or decreased comfort due to the multiple sensors required for the diagnostic test. These limitations, together with the difficulty of detecting the symptoms of these diseases, result in the majority of patients suffering from them being neither diagnosed nor treated. The aim of this thesis is to suggest new mHealth tools and techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of OSA and to study the effect of comorbidities, such as OSA-COPD overlap syndrome. To achieve it, we have studied how accelerometers, which are sensors embedded in any smartphone, together with portable devices, such as pulse oximeters, can be used to detect variations in physiological variables, such as respiration or sleep position and to measure novel physiological biomarkers. To achieve the goal of this thesis, signal acquisition protocols in hospital and home environments have been developed. These protocols use simultaneously smartphones and PSG or other portable OSA diagnostic devices and have been designed and implemented in collaboration with the sleep laboratory of ‘Hospital Clínic’ from Barcelona and the Interdisciplinary Center of Sleep Medicine of 'Chartié niversitätsmedizin' from Berlin, during a three-month research stay. The signals recorded following these protocols have been used to propose new biomarkers capable of providing relevant clinical information to diagnose and monitor different physiological parameters related to OSA and OSA-COPD overlap syndrome. The articles presented in this thesis show how smartphones, through accelerometry and oximetry, are promising mHealth tools as they can detect variations in the respiration pattern that correspond to the occurrence of total or partial airway occlusion events of OSA. These biomarkers have also allowed studying the influence of sleep position on the occurrence of OSA events, known as positional obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (pOSA). The studies we carried out have shown that a higher resolution of the sleep position is necessary to properly determine the existence of positional behavior in the occurrence of OSA events. Finally, after analyzing the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring systems and determining that smartphones can be used as diagnostic and monitoring tools for sleep disorders, we developed a mobile application (‘SleepPos’ app) that implements part of the knowledge acquired during the thesis. Currently, this application allows monitoring the sleep position in high resolution, as well as preventing, through vibration, the supine position when sleeping, in which most OSA events occur. The results obtained by using this application reinforced the idea that smartphones, which are worldwide available devices, can be used as mobile health tools and, as discussed throughout this thesis, can foster the introduction of new techniques to quantify the severity of OSA. (Català) El son és un estat fisiològic que ocupa un terç de l'activitat diària de les persones. Una mala qualitat del son altera la concentració i la productivitat i també augmenta la probabilitat de desenvolupar complicacions de salut. La síndrome de l'apnea obstructiva del son (SAOS) és una malaltia que afecta la qualitat del son i es caracteritza per l'aparició d'esdeveniments d'oclusió total o parcial de les vies respiratòries. Aquesta alteració de la respiració pot causar hipòxia, que incrementa el risc de patir malalties cardiovasculars i cerebrovasculars. La SAOS es pot veure agreujada per comorbiditats, entre elles, la malaltia pulmonar obstructiva crònica (MPOC). La MPOC és una de les principals causes de mortalitat al món i es caracteritza per una inflamació persistent de les vies respiratòries que afecta l'intercanvi de gasos als pulmons. La SAOS i la MPOC es poden presentar de forma conjunta com a síndrome de superposició SAOS-MPOC. La tècnica estàndard per a la diagnosi de les malalties relacionades amb el son és la polisomnografia (PSG), que mesura múltiples variables fisiològiques. La PSG, però, té limitacions: cost elevat, l'alteració del son degut a dormir en un entorn diferent, o disminució del confort produïda pels múltiples sensors necessaris. Les limitacions exposades, en combinació amb la dificultat de detectar els símptomes, provoquen que la majoria dels pacients no estiguin ni diagnosticats ni tractats. L'objectiu d'aquesta tesi és proposar noves eines de salut mòbil i tècniques de detecció i monitorització de la SAOS, i estudiar l'efecte de la síndrome SAOS-MPOC. Per fer-ho, s'ha estudiat com els acceleròmetres, sensors incorporats en qualsevol telèfon intel·ligent, juntament amb dispositius portables com els pulsioxímetres, poden ser emprats per mesurar nous marcadors biològics en múltiples variables fisiològiques, com la respiració o la posició del son. Per assolir l'objectiu d'aquesta tesi s'han preparat protocols d'adquisició de senyals per a l'entorn hospitalari i domiciliari, que utilitzen telèfons intel·ligents amb altres dispositius de diagnosi de la SAOS. Aquests protocols s'han dissenyat i implementat en col·laboració amb el laboratori del son de l'Hospital Clínic de Barcelona i el \"Interdisciplinary Center of Sleep Medicine\" del \"Chartié Universitätsmedizin\" de Berlin, on s'hi va fer una estada de recerca de tres mesos. Els senyals enregistrats amb aquests protocols han servit per proposar nous biomarcadors capaços de proporcionar informació clínica rellevant per diagnosticar i monitoritzar diferents paràmetres fisiològics relacionats amb la SAOS i el síndrome de superposició SAOS-MPOC. Els articles presentats en aquesta tesi mostren com els telèfons intel·ligents són eines prometedores per a la salut mòbil ja que tenen la capacitat de detectar variacions en la respiració que es corresponen amb l'aparició dels esdeveniments d'oclusió de les vies respiratòries de la SAOS. Aquests biomarcadors també han permès estudiar la influència de la posició en la qual dormim respecte a l'aparició dels esdeveniments de la SAOS, que es coneix com a síndrome de l'apnea obstructiva del son posicional (SAOSp). Finalment, també s'ha desenvolupat una aplicació mòbil (\"SleepPos\" app) que implementa part dels coneixements adquirits durant la tesi. Actualment aquesta aplicació permet monitoritzar la posició del son amb alta resolució, així com evitar per mitjà de la vibració que es dormi en una posició supina, en la qual es produeixen la majoria d’esdeveniments de la SAOS. Els resultats obtinguts amb l'ús d'aquesta aplicació demostren com els telèfons intel·ligents, que són uns dispositius disponibles arreu del món, poden ser utilitzats com a eines de salut mòbil i, tal com s'ha exposat al llarg d'aquesta tesi, obren les portes a incorporar noves tècniques que permetin quantificar la severitat de la SAOS.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and split-night studies: consensus statement of the Connecticut Thoracic Society and the Connecticut Neurological Society.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography.",

      "abstract": "The deficiency or dysfunction of orexin (hypocretin) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus causes narcolepsy, a rare neurological condition.Narcolepsy is one of the most molecularly researched sleep disorders.Narcolepsy impacts between 0.02-0.05percent of the world's population, according to estimates.Excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are signs of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), which are followed by sleep-wake symptoms such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted sleep.Type 1 narcolepsy is due to poor Brain and Nervous system (CNS) hypocretin signaling, which is distinguishable from other primary CNS hypersomnia, which appears to lie along a range of narcolepsy Type 2 to undiagnosed hypersomnia.It's marked by extreme daytime sleepiness and a lack of muscle tone (cataplexy).The information collected affirm the view of NT1 as a hypothalamic condition involving not only sleep-wake but also sensory, psychological, mental, cognitive, biochemical, and somatic processes, as well as uncertainties about the 'narcoleptic borderland,' including narcolepsy form 2 (NT2).Medications are currently symptom-based, although they have seen mixed outcomes as applied to other hypersomnia's.The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on clinical symptoms and the exclusion of other factors of excessive sleepiness.Stimulant medications are used to treat daytime sleepiness, numb hypnotics for cataplexy, and hydroxybutyrate for both symptoms.Since narcolepsy is such an under-diagnosed condition, it's critical for healthcare professionals and other primary health-care providers to spot unexplained daytime sleepiness early on.",

      "title": "Sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness of sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular disorders. Most of the sleep disturbances in neuromuscular disorders are secondary to sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is commonly associated with a slowly developing chronic respiratory failure, particularly in the advanced stages, but the condition often remains unrecognized and untreated. The most common sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders is sleep-related hypoventilation which initially manifests during REM sleep and later as the disease advances, it is also noted during non-REM sleep and even during daytime. In addition to the hypoventilation, central and upper airway obstructive apneas as well as hypopneas occur. Hypoventilation during sleep gives rise to hypoxemia and hypercapnea causing chronic respiratory failure. The abnormal blood gases may later persist during the daytime. Some patients may, however, have sleep onset or maintenance insomnia as a result of associated pain, muscle immobility, contractures, joint pains and muscle cramps as well as anxiety and depression.The commonest complaint in patients with neuromuscular disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing is excessive daytime somnolence as a result of repeated arousals and sleep fragmentation due to sleep hypoventilation and transient nocturnal hypoxemia. Sleep-disordered breathing causing sleep disturbance is well known in patients with poliomyelitis, postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, primary muscle disorders including muscular dystrophies and myotonic dystrophy, congenital or acquired myopathies, neuromuscular junctional disorders and polyneuropathies. All of these conditions may cause weakness of the diaphragm, the intercostal and accessory muscles of respiration causing breathlessness and other respiratory dysrhythmias. As a result of the respiratory and upper airway muscle weakness, the normal sleep-related respiratory physiologic vulnerability becomes pathological in these patients with neuro-muscular disorders causing hypoventilation or central and upper airway obstructive apneas during sleep. Multiple factors are responsible for sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disorders causing sleep hypoventilation and other respiratory dysrhythmias, and these include: impaired chest bellows, increased work of breathing, hypo-responsive respiratory chemoreceptors, increased upper airway resistance, decreased minute and alveolar ventilation, REM-related marked hypotonia or atonia of the respiratory muscles except the diaphragm, respiratory muscle fatigue and kyphoscoliosis secondary to neuromuscular disorders causing extrapulmonary restriction of the lungs. Nocturnal hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure in neuromuscular disorders may present insidiously and initially may remain asymptomatic. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed. Clinical clues suggesting sleep-disordered breathing include daytime hypersomnolence, breathlessness, disturbed nocturnal sleep and unexplained leg edema. If the clinical clues strongly suggest sleep-disordered breathing, a physical examination must be directed to uncover bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness. Patients with neuromuscular disorders showing these clinical features must be investigated to uncover nocturnal hypoventilation to prevent serious consequences of chronic.",

Diagnostic categories include the following: sleep related breathing disorders, other respiratory disorders, narcolepsy, parasomnias, sleep related seizure disorders, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement sleep disorder, depression with insomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Polysomnography is routinely indicated for the diagnosis of sleep related breathing disorders; for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration in patients with sleep related breathing disorders; for the assessment of treatment results in some cases; with a multiple sleep latency test in the evaluation of suspected narcolepsy; in evaluating sleep related behaviors that are violent or otherwise potentially injurious to the patient or others; and in certain atypical or unusual parasomnias. Polysomnography may be indicated in patients with neuromuscular disorders and sleep related symptoms; to assist in the diagnosis of paroxysmal arousals or other sleep disruptions thought to be seizure related; in a presumed parasomnia or sleep related seizure disorder that does not respond to conventional therapy; or when there is a strong clinical suspicion of periodic limb movement sleep disorder. Polysomnography is not routinely indicated to diagnose chronic lung disease; in cases of typical, uncomplicated, and noninjurious parasomnias when the diagnosis is clearly delineated; for patients with seizures who have no specific complaints consistent with a sleep disorder; to diagnose or treat restless legs syndrome; for the diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep disorders; or to establish a diagnosis of depression.",

Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nWith the advent of the electroencephalographic study of sleep (1-3) and the more comprehensive\nmethodology of polysomnography (4), the era of the objective assessment of sleep had arrived.\nAlong with this technology, came the promise that sleep related complaints could be accounted\nfor by abnormal physiologic function during sleep. That is, it was believed that the simultaneous\nand long duration monitoring of sleep continuity and sleep architecture along with pulmonary,\ncardiac, motor, and cortical function would reveal the abnormalities that account for sleep initiation and maintenance problems, the report of shallow and/or fragmented and/or nonrestorative\nsleep, and/or the diurnal complaints of sleepiness and fatigue. To a large extent this promise was\nrealized for the complaint of shallow and/or fragmented and/or nonrestorative sleep, and/or\nthe diurnal complaints of pathologic sleepiness. The polysomnographic study of sleep revealed\nthat these complaints were, in large measure, directly related to sleep disordered breathing. The\npromise, however, was not realized for the complaint of insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance problems). In fact, the very effort to objectively measure sleep continuity disturbance1\nraised more questions than it answered. That is, the objective assessment of sleep with electroencephalography brought into sharp resolution that remarkable discrepancies existed between the\nsubjective and objective measure of sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings,\nand total sleep time (4,5). Further, no evidence was obtained for physiologic abnormalities that\nclearly accounted for difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (e.g., abnormal REM pressure,\nslow wave sleep deficiency, sleep onset related central apneic events, sleep induced cardiac or\nCNS irregularities, etc.). At best some of these factors were found to be indicative of “Secondary\nInsomnia” and particularly the sleep of patients with major depression (6,7).",

Quanto à relação da SAOS e repercussões socioeconômicas, tem-se: (1) aumento do número, proporção e gravidade de acidentes automobilísticos devido à diminuição da concentração do motorista; (2) prejuízos ocupacionais com queda na produtividade, demissões e acidentes de trabalho; (3) prejuízo social: o individuo com SAOS representa também um perigo potencial para toda a sociedade por aumento de imperícias; (4) aumento de gastos públicos e privados: manutenção de rodovias e estrutura de fiscalização e apoio, gastos previdenciários, custos diagnósticos, terapêuticos e hospitalares. A SAOS deveria ser considerada uma doença de saúde pública, dados seus inequívocos prejuízos individuais, sociais e econômicos.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Severe sleep inertia (SI) can often be managed with behavioral modifications and stimulants. This patient’s sleep inertia was resistant to such therapies but had remarkable improvement with Bupropion. Report of case(s) An 11-year-old male with a history of seizures presented with hypersomnolence, SI and difficulty arousing in the morning for 3 years. There was no reported cataplexy, with occasional hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Family denied witnessed apneas or snoring. He had previously undergone an adenotonsillectomy at 6 years of age for obstructive sleep apnea. When initially seen, he was not taking antiseizure medications, Epworth score was 14 and BMI was 30.5 kg/m2. Polysomnogram showed an AHI of 1.5 events/hour with REM latency of 179.5 minutes. Multiple sleep latency testing showed a mean sleep latency of 4 minutes, 7 seconds with 3 SOREM periods: consistent with narcolepsy. Melatonin and methylphenidate were initially prescribed, followed by dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, but were discontinued due to worsening hypersomnolence. Armodafinil improved his overall daytime sleepiness, however, severe SI persisted intermittently in the morning and with naps to the point of EMS being called on multiple occasions. EEG and brain-MRI were normal. For suspected cataplexy, venlafaxine was tried and not beneficial. Calcium-magnesium-potassium and sodium oxybate (XW) lead to no improvement in his SI. Therefore, Methylphenidate-20mg (MP) and then Armodafinil-50mg were added before bedtime, however, his SI persisted with frequently missed school. Bedtime Bupropion 150 mg was added with an immediate response. He has not missed school or daytime activities with Bupropion. Conclusion Sleep inertia is typically a characteristic of idiopathic hypersomnia rather than narcolepsy and is related to the abnormal transition of sleep to wakefulness resulting in reduced alertness, impaired performance, and desire to return to sleep. Such pronounced sleep inertia is atypical and caused significant quality of life impairment in our patient. Nighttime melatonin, XW, MP, and bupropion for SI has been described in the literature1. Our patient failed multiple treatments before bupropion which was immediately successful. Support (if any) 1.

After clinical evaluation and overnight, hospital-based video-polysomnography, the cause of the chronic injurious parasomnia was deemed to be a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnia comorbid with severe obstructive sleep apnea. Therapy with bedtime clonazepam and bilevel positive airway pressure was effective, with injurious parasomnia relapse occurring with cessation of either or both of these therapies. The differential diagnosis of sleep-related biting should now include NREM sleep parasomnia (with or without comorbid obstructive sleep apnea), besides previously reported cases of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder and anticipated cases of parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnia), sleep-related biting seizures, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

We compared postprandial naps and day-long sleep deprived EEGs in 36 patients with generalized seizures, 57 complex partial seizure patients, and 7 individuals with mixed seizure disorders. Ten of 36 generalized seizure patients had normal sleep and sleep deprived EEGs, while both were normal in 16 of 57 partial seizure patients. Both were abnormal in 18 of 36 generalized and 22 of 57 partial epileptics. Seven generalized seizure patients had epileptiform discharges or seizures during afternoon naps but normal sleep deprived EEGs. No partial seizure patients had normal sleep deprived EEGs and abnormal nap, but 29 of 57 had abnormalities or seizures only with sleep deprivation. All 7 mixed seizure patients had abnormal sleep and sleep deprived studies, and 6 had seizures, 4 on both studies. Natural sleep may facilitate the appearance of generalized seizures or epilepti-form discharges, while sleep deprivation may accentuate the yield of EEG abnormality in partial epilepsy. Either is likely to be abnormal in patients with mixed seizures and encephalopathy. Natural sleep and sleep deprived EEGs are an appropriate combination in the evaluation of refractory seizures.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and narcolepsy are sleep disorders that commonly present with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). OSAS is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep-wake disorder characterized by EDS, cataplexy, vivid hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The overlap of symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis and delayed appropriate treatment. We report two male patients who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of OSAS, including loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and significant daytime sleepiness. Despite appropriate OSAS management with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), both patients continued to experience EDS and reported episodes of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams. Polysomnography (PSG) confirmed mild to moderate OSAS, and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) revealed mean sleep latencies of less than 5 min with multiple sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Based on the presence of cataplexy and MSLT findings, narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) was diagnosed in both cases. Treatment with modafinil in conjunction with CPAP therapy led to significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life. These cases highlight the importance of considering narcolepsy in patients with persistent EDS despite adequate OSAS treatment. Coexistence of NT1 and OSAS can obscure the diagnosis of narcolepsy, leading to delays in appropriate management. Comprehensive evaluation, including detailed patient history and sleep studies, is crucial. Combined therapy targeting both conditions may be effective in managing symptoms and improving patient outcomes.",

Detailed clinical description of sleep function and its study with the use of modern instrumental methods is important for timely and differential diagnosis of mental disorders in PTSD patients. 21 war veterans fighting in \"hot spots were observed during treatment in the specialized department of psychological rehabilitation, Samara Regional Clinical Hospital for War Veterans. After clinical interview the overnight polysomnography \"Sagura-2000\" (PSG) was performed. Sleep disorders in PTSD patients are characterized by the complex of subjective, clinical and neurophysiological symptoms: Superficial sleep (restless, lack of deep sleep); Increased motor activity during sleep (number of activations of the paradoxical phase of sleep to those of deep sleep); Nightmares; Specific (defensive) movements during sleep; Frequent nocturnal awakening (increased number and duration of awakenings); The excess of REM sleep. PSG identified the most frequently related nightmares neurodynamic phenomena: Deficiency of the deep sleep (stages 3 and 4 NREM); Up to 70% of the time NREM takes stage 2 sleep; The increase in motor and EEG activations; The number of activations of the REM than those of NREM; The increase in total REM sleep time; Increasing episodes of REM sleep.

In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, second edition (ICSD-2) (1), a diagnosis of insomnia must confirm both the existence of nocturnal symptoms and a clinically significant impact during the patient's waking state. Nocturnal symptoms include difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or nonrestorative sleep. Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being. Researchers have traditionally used quantitative criteria to diagnose insomnia, but these criteria have not been standardized.

      "abstract": "Sleep Paralysis is the persistence of REM atonia into the wakefulness. It is found in normal subjects, but is frequently seen in narcolepsy, in conjunction with hypnogogic hallucinations and cataplexy. We investigated whether sleep paralysis may be associated with sleep disorders other than narcolepsy. A retrospective review of all patients seen at St Thomas9 Sleep Disorders Centre over a 9-year period was undertaken looking for sleep paralysis as a presenting symptom. In total, 15 patients were identified who presented with sleep paralysis without other features of narcolepsy. Three had a family history of isolated sleep paralysis, five had isolated sleep paralysis without family history, and seven were found to have episodes of desaturation or apnoea in REM sleep on polysomnography. Treatment with oral appliances, CPAP or ENT surgery resulted in resolution in sleep paralysis symptoms in three patients, and in one patient weight loss alone caused improvement. None were subsequently diagnosed with narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis can be isolated or in associated with narcolepsy, but it can be the presenting symptom of OSA. In this situation appropriate treatment of OSA may lead to resolution of the sleep paralysis. Isolated sleep paralysis does not appear to be a presentation of narcolepsy.",

Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis.

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

Les parasomnies du sommeil lent profond (SLP) regroupent le somnambulisme, les terreurs nocturnes et les eveils confusionnels et surviennent au decours d’eveils brutaux en SLP. Elles s’associent souvent chez un meme individu et pourraient representer des variantes cliniques d’une meme pathologie.Longtemps considerees comme des troubles benins du sommeil, les donnees actuelles soulignent les consequences des parasomnies, avec des mises en danger et un retentissement fonctionnel diurne. Nos trois premiers travaux ont permis une meilleure caracterisation du phenotype et des consequences des parasomnies, en particulier sur le plan de la somnolence et des phenomenes douloureux chroniques. Pres de la moitie des adultes parasomniaques rapportaient une plainte de somnolence diurne excessive associee a une propension marquee au sommeil sur les premieres heures de la journee. Nous retrouvions une frequence elevee de douleurs chroniques, de cephalees et de migraine. Par ailleurs nous avons decrit un phenomene frequent d’hypo/analgesie au cours des acces parasomniaques.Le diagnostic des parasomnies du SLP repose uniquement sur des elements cliniques, sans criteres polysomnographiques objectifs. Si des travaux recents suggerent que les parasomnies sont associees a des alterations discretes de la microstructure du SLP, les performances diagnostiques de ces parametres n’ont pas fait l’objet d’etudes specifiques. Nous avons developpe une nouvelle methode d’analyse polysomnographique qui offre de bonnes performances de classification chez des adultes parasomniaques et des sujets temoins.Malgre cinq decennies d’etudes cliniques et experimentales, la physiopathologie de ces parasomnies reste mal connue. Un modele permet de conceptualiser les mecanismes de la maladie. Chez un patient predispose genetiquement, certaines conditions responsables d’une instabilite du SLP favorisent la survenue d’un eveil dissocie precipite par un stimulus eveillant. Nos travaux en cours et futurs porteront sur l’etude de ces mecanismes au moyen de techniques innovantes de genetique, d’electrophysiologie et d’imagerie fonctionnelle.",

      "title": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Case Confounding with Thyrotoxicosis",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) that is typically associated with cataplexy, sleep fragmentation and other REM sleep-related phenomenon such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination. Narcoleptic symptoms can be developed from various medical or neurological disorders. A 17-year-old male patient admitted for the evaluation of EDS which started three-month ago. He slept more than 18 hours a day with cataplexy and hypnagogic hallucination. He was obese with body mass index (BMI) of 30.4 kg/. After admission he was newly diagnosed to the thyrotoxicosis. T3 391.2 ng/dL (60-181), free T4 4.38 ng/dL (0.89-1.76), TSH /mL (0.35-5.5) were measured. His pulse rate ranged 70-90 beats per minute and blood pressure ranged 150/100-120/70 mmHg. Polysomnography revealed many fragmentations in sleep with many positional changes (81 times/h). Sleep onset latency was 33.5 min, sleep efficiency was 47.9%, and REM latency from sleep onset was delayed to 153.6 min. REM sleep percent was increased to 27.1%. Periodic limb movement index was 13.4/h. In the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), average sleep latency was 0.4 min and there were noted 3 SOREMPs (Sleep Onset REM sleep period) on 5 trials. We couldn't discriminate the obvious sleep-wake pattern in the actigraph and his HLA DQB1 type was negative. His thyroid function improved following treatment with methimazole and propranolol. Vital sign maintained within normal range. Cataplexy was controlled with venlafaxine 75 mg. Subjective night sleep continuity and PLMS were improved with clonazepam 0.5 mg, but the EDS were partially improved with modafinil 200-400 mg. Thyrotoxicosis might give confounding role when we were evaluating the EDS, though sleep fragmentation was one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but enormous amount of it made us think of the influence of thyroid hormone. The loss of sleep-wake cycle, limited improvement of EDS to the stimulant treatmen, and the cataplexy not supported by HLA DQB1 should be answered further. We still should rule out idiopathic hypersomnia and measuring CSF hypocretin level would be helpful.",

In published reports from sleep clinics, 51% of all patients complain of EDS (excessive daytime sleepiness) and 90% of apnea patients have this complaint. A second major impetus for research on EDS has been the introduction of an objective method of quantifying sleepiness. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) measures the latency to polygraphically defined sleep in 20-minute opportunities given in a standard environment at 2-hour intervals across the day. The MSLT has proven to be a reliable measure, free of the practice or motivational problems associated with the more behavioral measures of alertness. Finally, the MSLT has been validated in varieties of experimental and clinical paradigms.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

In the last few decades, there have been considerable advances in knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, treatment options, and the impact of OSA on personal as well as public health of OSA since the disease terminology was first coined. The current definitions of sleep apnea are not uniform, but most of them attempt to characterize the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing events (e.g., AHI \"Apnea–Hypopnea Index\" or RDI \"Respiratory Disturbance Index\") along with the severity (e.g., oxygen desaturation) of each event (e.g., complete (apnea) and partial (hypopnea) cessation of breathing during sleep) [2].",

      "abstract": "A review of the sleep of 31 patients 45 years old or older undergoing nocturnal penile tumescence studies showed that 19 had a previously undiagnosed sleep disorder. Of the patients 9 had periodic leg movements in sleep, 9 had sleep apnea and 1 had both disorders. In 10 of these patients the sleep disorders affected nocturnal penile tumescence by disrupting sleep and causing brief periods of detumescence, movement artifacts and delays in the tumescing phase of nocturnal penile tumescence. These disruptions resulted in an apparently abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence that appeared as if the patient had difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. The nocturnal penile tumescence disruptions may have reflected only a disruption of the necessary conditions for normal nocturnal penile tumescence to occur, namely adequate sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The results strongly suggest that failure to measure concurrent sleep parameters and screen for occult sleep disorders could result in the incorrect diagnosis of abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the diagnostic criteria for hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo to be included in the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD). The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

The second type of abnormality consisted of spikes or multiple spikes, isolated or in long-lasting discharges up to 20 sec of duration, focalized or maximal over the vertex and central regions. These spikes observed in 7 patients, occurred in all stages of sleep and were particularly evident during REM sleep.

      "title": "Waking up to the importance of sleeping well for cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "The potentially adverse impact of poor sleep quality, insomnia, and other sleep disorders on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been the subject of increasing exploration over the past decade. Obstructive sleep apnea has been the most extensively studied sleep disorder in relation to hypertension, and is thought to be causally related through mechanisms including heightened sympathetic nervous system activity and vascular endothelial dysfunction that are triggered by sleep-disordered breathing.1 A growing body of research evidence has also revealed relationships between insomnia and CVD. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder and is defined by subjective reports of difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking too early.2 With insomnia, both sleep quality and duration are often impaired. Although a diagnosis of insomnia disorder may be based on self-report alone, objectively assessed insomnia features using polysomnography reveals longer sleep onset latency, more frequent nocturnal awakenings, and prolonged periods of wakefulness during the sleep period relative to normal sleepers.3 Observational studies employing objective sleep measures show that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have CVD, even after controlling for comorbid sleep disorders, and other potentially confounding comorbidities.4 Short sleep duration has also been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, higher blood pressure (BP), metabolic syndrome, greater coronary calcification, and higher levels of stress hormones.5 An important pathway through which sleep may affect CVD risk is through its relationship with BP, with substantial support for an association between insomnia and incident hypertension.6, 7 For example, in a prospective study of 786 men and women from the Penn State Cohort, those with chronic insomnia, determined by polysomnographic study and subjective reports of sleep problems persisting for over a year, were at over twice the risk of developing hypertension over a 7.5-year follow-up period. Furthermore, chronic insomnia coupled with short sleep duration (<6 hours) was associated with a fourfold increased risk of developing hypertension.8 Other studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, have reported similar observations, reinforcing the perspective that insomnia, when coupled with short sleep duration, may be especially hazardous in terms of its association with hypertension and CVD.9-11 Poor sleep quality is a widespread problem, commonly reported by patients with a variety of medical and mental health conditions,12, 13 as well as among those with diagnosed sleep disorders. However, the potentially broad impact of poor self-reported sleep quality on CVD risk has received relatively little attention. In the current issue of the Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Lo and colleagues report14 an informative meta-analysis examining the association between subjective sleep quality and BP. The authors include data from studies based on over 45 000 participants spanning five continents and provide formal analyses of studies that assessed subjective sleep quality using the well-established and validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.15, 16 Their analyses showed that poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher BP and an increased likelihood of hypertension. The impact of poor sleep quality is perhaps likely to be most conspicuously reflected in BP during the nighttime sleep period. Ambulatory BP monitoring studies have established that BP typically exhibits a circadian rhythm characterized by a fall in pressure during the nighttime sleep period. Relative to daytime pressure, a nighttime dip in BP of ≥10% is considered normal and individuals with this level of BP dipping are referred to as BP dippers, whereas a nighttime BP dip of <10% describes nondippers.17 Lo and colleagues found that in the subset of studies in their meta-analysis, which used both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ambulatory BP monitoring, BP dippers were characterized by better sleep quality than nondippers. Other studies, using subjective as well as objective measures of sleep quality derived from polysomnography and actigraphy, also have shown poor sleep quality to be associated with a blunting of the normal nighttime dip in BP.18-22 The nondipping circadian BP profile is associated with target organ damage, including cardiac left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease23, 24 and is a strong prognostic indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for both patients with and those without hypertension.23, 25-28 This evidence underscores the importance of BP measured during the nighttime sleep period, reflecting its greater prognostic significance than clinic BP, or ambulatory BP assessed during the daytime.29 Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms accounting for blunted nighttime BP dipping and elevated nighttime BP are not well understood.30 Sympathetic nervous system activity normally shows a substantial decline from daytime waking activities to nighttime sleep, but the magnitude of this decline is attenuated in the context of a nondipping nighttime BP profile.21, 31, 32 Heightened nighttime sympathetic nervous system activity would favor peripheral vascular constriction, resulting in abnormally elevated systemic vascular resistance during the sleep period.33 The contribution of vascular disease to a blunted nighttime BP dip is supported by observations that a nondipping circadian BP profile is approximately twice as common in patients with coronary heart disease compared with age-matched healthy controls.34, 35 Blunted BP dipping has also been associated with impaired vascular endothelial function in women with untreated hypertension.35 As might be anticipated, in a study of men and women with hypertension, the hemodynamic mechanism related to a nondipping BP profile was a failure for systemic vascular resistance to show a normal decline during the nighttime sleep period.37 In view of the well-established pathophysiologic significance of elevated systemic vascular resistance in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension,38 coupled with the prognostic significance of elevated nighttime BP, it is not difficult to appreciate the potential importance that sleep quality may have in the pathogenesis of hypertensive heart disease. The available evidence therefore clearly implicates poor sleep quality and insomnia as risk factors in the cause of hypertension. It also suggests that in the context of high BP and hypertension, poor sleep quality may exacerbate hypertension by promoting target organ damage and increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the critical question of whether poor sleep quality is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension and CVD remains unanswered. In 2016, the American Heart Association published a scientific statement calling for research aimed at better understanding the association between sleep duration, sleep quality, and insomnia with CVD.39 Despite the wealth of available evidence, it is almost all observational, and the existence of a causal relationship between insomnia and CVD remains conjecture rather than inference. However, there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. In a pilot study of 22 adults with high BP, who slept <7 h/d, 13 were randomized to a 6-week intervention designed to extend the sleep period and 9 to a control condition.40 Those in the sleep-extension group showed a postintervention increase in sleep duration of 35 minutes following the intervention, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in 24-hour BP, whereas no significant changes occurred in the control group. We now need more well-designed randomized controlled trials to test the broad hypothesis that improving sleep quality in individuals with insomnia or subjectively reported sleep problems will reduce the risk of developing hypertension, as well as help control BP in those with hypertension, ultimately reducing the risk of adverse clinical events. Examining the effects of pharmacological treatments to improve sleep would be of interest, but interventions using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia may be especially informative. Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia is safe and effective and is the current gold standard for insomnia treatment.41 Therefore, it is ideally suited for intervention trials in healthy individuals and in patients with hypertension and/or other medical and psychiatric comorbidities. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

      "title": "1221 Multiple Sleep Latency Testing in Patients with Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) has an estimated prevalence of 10-25%. Disorders of central hypersomnolence such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia pose a diagnostic challenge since commonly used psychotropic medications can alter REM sleep parameters on polysomnography (PSG). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has published protocols for the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), including a 2-week medication discontinuation period (MDP) prior to testing, however discontinuation must be carefully considered. Report of case(s) A 22-year-old female with obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and optic nerve hypoplasia presented with episodic EDS for several years. Epworth was 14 despite amphetamine-dextromphetamine 30mg twice daily. These episodes would last for 1-2 weeks without associated hypersexuality, increased food seeking behaviors or changes in cognition. Additionally, she would experience periods of not sleeping for days at a time, but not decreased need for sleep. She denied cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. No symptoms of bipolar disorder reported. Initial polysomnography showed 432 minutes of sleep, REM latency of 39.5 minutes and AHI of 0.1. MSLT showed a mean sleep latency of 11.5 minutes without sleep onset REM periods. She reported later that she was unable to complete the MDP for escitalopram. The diagnosis at that time was hypersomnolence related to a mental disorder, and referred back to psychiatry. She returned 20 months later with more persistent hypersomnolence and a MDP was attempted again, this time with confirmation. She stopped venlafaxine and stimulant per protocol. PSG was again unremarkable and MSLT showed mean sleep latency of 7 minutes across 5 naps and SOREMP in 4 naps, resulting in the diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy. Conclusion Sleep symptoms are common in patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, and MDP can pose safety risks or be poorly adhered to. Longitudinal follow-up, repeat testing for persistent and worsening symptoms of EDS, and careful questioning about adherence to MSLT protocol can help clarify the eventual diagnosis. Support (if any) None.",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

All four are characterized by sleep disturbance leading to daytime hypersomnolence. In OSAHS, repetitive partial or complete upper airway obstruction leads to respiratory effort-related arousals and sleep fragmentation. Weight loss can lead to resolution of symptoms. The mainstay of treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP maintains airway patency by delivering a constant positive end-expiratory pressure. OHS occurs in obese patients and causes nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation. Patients have daytime hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 6 kPa) and hypoxaemia (PaO2 < 9 kPa). Some patients can be treated with CPAP, but those who do not respond require bi-level positive airway pressure. Periodic limb movements of sleep is a condition in which repetitive movements of the legs or arms worsen at night. Narcolepsy is characterized by hypersomnolence, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucinations. Patients with narcolepsy should be referred to specialized sleep centres for full polysomnography and management.",

The arousal is accompanied by a snort or loud snoring (inspiration against a partially obstructed upper airway).

Nächtliche generalisierte tonisch-klonische Anfälle, aber auch multiple fokal-komplexe Anfälle führen zu einer Störung der Schlafarchitektur sowie zu einer vermehrten Tagesmüdigkeit. Zudem ist kein REM-Rebound in den nachfolgenden Nächten zu beobachten. Unabhängig von den Anfällen führt der chronische epileptische Zustand – insbesondere bei Patienten mit fokalen Epilepsien – zu Störungen der Schlafarchitektur. Epilepsiepatienten leiden im Vergleich zur Allgemeinbevölkerung an einer 2- bis 3-fach erhöhten Prävalenz von subjektiv empfundenen Schlafstörungen. Schlafstörungen sind zudem mit einer signifikanten Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität assoziiert. Auch Kinder mit Epilepsie leiden häufiger an Schlafstörungen als gesunde Kinder, wobei eine schlechte Schlafqualität wiederum zu Verhaltensproblemen und einer schlechteren Lebensqualität führt. Eine vermehrte Tagesmüdigkeit stellt mit einer Prävalenz von 30–50% die häufigste schlafbezogene Störung bei Epilepsiepatienten dar und konnte auch mit objektiven Tests nachgewiesen werden. Obstruktive Schlaf-Apnoen (OSA) treten bei Epilepsiepatienten mit einer Prävalenz von 10–33% signifikant häufiger auf als in der Allgemeinbevölkerung. Als mögliche Mechanismen sind die Effekte von zentral dämpfenden Antiepileptika, eine durch Antiepileptika verursachte Gewichtszunahme und das gehäufte Vorliegen eines polyzystischen Ovar-Syndroms bei Frauen mit Epilepsie anzuführen. Eine OSA kann mit einer Exazerbation von Anfällen einhergehen. Umgekehrt kann die erfolgreiche Behandlung einer OSA zu einer Verbesserung der Anfallskontrolle führen.",

CONCLUSÃO: A SAOS é subnotificada na população epiléptica farmacorresistente e nos pacientes com sonolência excessiva diurna (pode ser consequência da SAOS) bem como nos que serão submetidos a estimulação do nervo vago (pode exacerbar SAOS em pacientes com SAOS pré-existente) para fim de controle de CE. Os dados dessa revisão levantam a hipótese da relação importante entre SAOS e CE, pois alguns estudos sugerem a relação mútua entre os dois fatores, apesar de não haver significância estatística. Existe uma relação inversa em um relato de caso de lobectomia frontal esquerda com resolução de CE e da apneia, levando a sugestão de que descargas epilépticas interictais extensas bem como a CE em si no sono pudessem alterar o controle das vias aéreas superiores.

      "abstract": "Key Clinical Message This study suggests that severe obstructive sleep apnea can present as sleep‐related epileptic or non‐epileptic seizures. A detailed history and physical examination, along with polysomnography and video electroencephalography findings can lead to the correct diagnosis. Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by recurrent episodes of the upper airway complete or partial collapse while sleeping. The obstructive episodes result in gradual suffocation that increases breathing attempts till the person is awakened. The main manifestations are excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, observed episodes of stopped breathing, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking. Nevertheless, there are very few reports of patients with OSA, manifesting other symptoms such as seizure‐like movements. Differentiating OSA with nocturnal seizures could be challenging due to their overlapping features. A 53‐year‐old man presented to the clinic, experiencing seizure‐like involuntary movements during nocturnal sleep for the past 2 years with a frequency of 2–3 times per night. Neurologic examinations were normal. Further evaluation with polysomnography revealed impaired arousal followed by seizure‐like movements during sleep. Video electroencephalography (EEG) did not show any epileptiform discharges, ruling out the nocturnal seizure diagnosis. The patient was diagnosed with OSA. Subsequently, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment resolved all symptoms.",

      "title": "Nocturia. A rarely recognized symptom of sleep apnea and other occult sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, awakening from sleep to urinate, is a common symptom in a variety of medical disorders and in the elderly. Awakening from sleep as a result of nocturia is thought to be secondary to a sensation of urinary urgency resulting from an overextended bladder. Nocturia-related awakenings cause significant sleep disruption and fatigue in elderly patients and are correlated with an increased number of falls at night. Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are also common in the elderly and are frequently the source of awakenings from sleep. The high incidence of both nocturia and sleep disorders in the elderly and other groups of patients suggests that sleep disorders may be the source of some awakenings from sleep usually attributed by patients to nocturia. Nocturia secondary to sleep disorders would be causatively different from nocturia secondary to pressure to urinate in common medical disorders and would require different diagnostic procedures and treatment.To determine the frequency of nocturia as a symptom of primary sleep disorders.Eighty consecutive patients, 27 women and 53 men with a mean (+/-SD) age of 58.7+/-14.1 years, undergoing polysomnography (sleep study or PSG) for the evaluation of a suspected sleep disorder and who met the sole criteria of awakening from sleep at least once and urinating voluntarily. Each patient had either a standard PSG recording or a PSG with administration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Immediately after each episode of nocturia during the PSG, patients were questioned about the reason they believed they had awakened. The PSG record immediately before awakening from sleep was then reviewed for potential causes of awakening. Patients were also asked on final morning awakening to fill in a questionnaire regarding their awakenings during the prior night. Patient reports were compared with the PSG to determine the accuracy of subjective reports.Patients awakened from sleep and voluntarily urinated a mean (+/- of 1.5+/-0.75 times per night for a total of 121 awakenings for the group. The majority (79.3%) of these awakenings from sleep were found to be directly secondary to sleep apnea, snoring or periodic leg movements in sleep. Patients correctly identified the source of their awakening from sleep on only five(4.9%) occasions and only once was sleep apnea correctly cited by a patient as a source of awakening during the night.Most awakenings from sleep attributed by our patients to pressure to urinate were instead a result of sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea. The fact that patients do urinate once awake likely contributed to faulty post hoc reasoning and might have limited further inquiry by patients and their physicians in clinical settings into the actual sources of awakening from sleep. Even in those patients with well-known medical reasons for noctruria, Sleep disorders were still found to be the source of almost all awakenings from sleep. Patients were extremely poor judges of the reasons they awoke from sleep. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder should be seriously considered whenever a patient reports frequent awakenings from sleep to urinate.",

There are approximately 20 000 people with narcolepsy in the United Kingdom, 100 000 in the United States. The diagnosis of narcoleptic syndrome is established by the history of recurrent daily short sleep attacks in combination with cataplexy, brief episodes of loss of muscle tone and paralysis. Narcolepsy often results from monotony, and cataplexy is usually due to a sudden increase in alertness, with laughter or surprise. About one-half of all subjects also have sleep paralysis, and many describe vivid dreams at sleep onset, or even during wakefulness. In classic cases, the diagnosis is obvious from the history, and also from the finding of at least two sleep-onset REM periods during a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The MSLT gives an index of daytime drowsiness, with measurement of the time of sleep onset at 2-h intervals on five occasions throughout the day.",

In this atypical state, she also showed excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), snoring, daytime naps and cognitive symptoms. After a sleep study with polysomnography, an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) manifested as atypical depression was diagnosed. Remission of depressive symptoms was verified with additional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. conclusion: The awareness that OSA could be presented as an atypical depression allows its early detection and treatment, and possibly the prevention of numerous medical disorders.

      "abstract": "Sleep complaints, habits, and medical history were surveyed in 81 patients chronically receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Seventy-three percent of the sample reported insomnia, and 52% reported unintentional napping during the day. Behavioral factors (such as caffeine or alcohol use) or the severity of concurrent medical disease did not account for the sleep problems. Eighteen of these patients subsequently underwent polysomnography and objective measurement of daytime sleepiness. Clinically significant sleep apnea syndrome was present in 11. The presence of sleep apnea was associated with increased levels of psychological distress and daytime sleepiness. Periodic leg movements during sleep were also frequently observed but had minimal effect on sleep quality. Implications of these findings for clinical practice are discussed.",

Periodic limb movements of sleep was initially called “nocturnal myoclonus.” This diagnosis cannot be made in the presence of another sleep disorder.

Period limb movements of sleep also may be associated with kidney failure, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle pathology, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and withdrawal from a variety of medications.

      "abstract": "Thirty-four patients who presented with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and who showed an elevated number of periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) were studied. None of these patients reported other symptoms or presented sleep laboratory manifestations of narcolepsy or of breathing disorders during sleep. A diagnosis of restless leg syndrome, head trauma or a past history of psychopathology or infectious diseases known to cause EDS were also ruled out. In addition, none of the patients reported a history of drug or alcohol abuse, chronic sleep deprivation or irregular sleep-wake schedule and none were taking medications known to influence sleep at the time of the study. Results of the present study showed no correlation between PLMS index and poor sleep efficiency or daytime sleepiness as measured by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, a significant negative correlation was found between sleep efficiency at night and the mean sleep latency on the MSLT. These results suggest not only that PLMS and nocturnal sleep disruption are not the primary cause of EDS, but that these sleepy patients have a high propensity to sleep both at night and during the daytime. Therefore, the presence of PLMS during nocturnal sleep recording should not preclude the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia.",

      "title": "Chronic insomnia remitting after maxillomandibular advancement for mild obstructive sleep apnea: a case series",
      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are both common sleep disorders. Chronic insomnia is thought to result from stress-related physiologic hyperarousal (somatic arousal) that makes it difficult for an individual to fall or stay asleep. Obstructive sleep apnea is thought to result from obstructive respiratory events causing arousals, sleep fragmentation, and recurrent oxygen desaturation. Although the two disorders seem different, they predispose to the same long-term, stress-related illnesses, and when they occur in the same individual, each affects the other's response to treatment; they interact. This report of three cases describes patients with both chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea in whom the chronic insomnia remitted with no specific treatment following treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with maxillomandibular advancement.Our three Caucasians patients each presented with severe, chronic insomnia associated with somatic arousal and fatigue occurring either alone, in association with bipolar disorder, or with temporomandibular joint syndrome. Polysomnography revealed that each patient also had mild obstructive sleep apnea, despite only one snoring audibly. One patient experienced a modest improvement in her somatic arousal, insomnia severity, and fatigue with autotitrating nasal continuous positive airway pressure, but the other two did not tolerate nasal continuous positive airway pressure. None of the patients received treatment for insomnia. All three patients subsequently underwent maxillomandibular advancement to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea and experienced prolonged, complete resolution of somatic arousal, chronic insomnia, and fatigue. The patient with bipolar disorder also experienced complete remission of his symptoms of depression during the 1 year he was followed postoperatively.These three cases lend support to the hypothesis that chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea share a pathophysiology of chronic stress. Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the stress response is directed at inspiratory airflow limitation during sleep (hypopnea, snoring, and inaudible fluttering of the throat). Therefore, when chronic insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea occur in one individual, aggressive treatment of obstructive sleep apnea may lead to a reduction in chronic stress that causes the patient's chronic insomnia to remit.",

Søvnsygdomme giver imidlertid ofte søvnbesvær og er dermed en vigtig årsag til søvnproblemer, hvorfor en total adskillelse af de to er umulig. Man kan ej heller udelukke, at samtidig forekomst af søvnbesvær ved søvnsygdomme kan have forstærkende effekt (f.eks. søvnbesvær ved søvnapnø), hvilket komplicerer adskillelse af årsag og virkning.

Respiration varies across the three sleep-wake states (wake, rapid eye movement, and nonrapid eye movement sleep). Obstructive sleep apnea is state dependent, occurring only during sleep. Although diurnal, obstructive lung diseases, congestive heart failure, and neuromuscular diseases are profoundly affected by the sleep state. Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses the full spectrum of respiratory ailments occurring during sleep. This chapter provides a practical approach to the sleep apnea syndromes (obstructive and central), disorders of nocturnal hypoventilation (obesity-hypoventilation and neuromuscular diseases), and cardiorespiratory illnesses exacerbated by sleep (congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases).

      "abstract": "Abstract Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and associated symptoms, including cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and disrupted nocturnal sleep. It is classified into two subtypes: narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), which involves cataplexy and/or low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin‐1 levels, and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), which lacks cataplexy and has normal or intermediate CSF hypocretin‐1 levels. Diagnosis is often delayed or missed due to symptom overlap with other sleep disorders, limited access to specialized testing, and low clinician awareness. Current diagnostic methods include the presence of cataplexy (specific to NT1), sleep‐onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) detected through polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests, and low CSF hypocretin‐1 levels (primarily for NT1). However, these methods have limitations, such as the invasiveness of CSF testing, variability in SOREMPs, and the absence of specific biomarkers for NT2. Emerging research suggests that electromyographic (EMG) activity during routine PSG, particularly elevated REM sleep without atonia, could serve as an alternative diagnostic marker for narcolepsy. This review explores the potential of EMG activity during REM sleep and the procedure of quantification in routine PSG, with the aim of improving early detection and reducing diagnostic delays in narcolepsy.",

Patients assigned to a high-suspicion group because of habitual loud snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, moderate to severe obesity, and observed apneas during sleep can potentially be diagnosed by either in-laboratory full polysomnography or a cardiopulmonary recording device at home. Patients with possible sleep apnea who do not fit into the high-probability group would be best served in a laboratory setting with full polysomnography using specialized monitoring devices to assess airflow limitation. Patients who present with a chief complaint of daytime sleepiness and a low chance of having sleep apnea might have periodic limb movements during sleep or narcolepsy. These patients would need full polysomnography in a sleep center potentially with a multiple sleep latency test the next day.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "title": "The connection of neuroendocrine diseases with sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "Most of the physiological functions of the body, including hormone secretion, differ during sleep and wakefulness. Circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep pressure are the determining factors in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Fluctuations in hormone levels are largely determined by circadian rhythms. The central biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is synchronized with external signals, and largely determines the daily rhythms of hormone secretion. Many hormones can affect respiratory function during sleep, exacerbating sleep apnea when their secretion is excessive or deficient. Sleep disorders can occur in a number of neuroendocrine diseases, worsening the quality of life of patients and, in some cases, contributing to the development of life-threatening complications. Screening for sleep disorders, in particular the active detection of sleep apnea in acromegaly, hypothyroidism and hypercorticism, can significantly reduce the risk of complications with timely treatment.",

      "abstract": "In the vast majority of patients with parasomnias, the evaluation can be accomplished in the office setting, based on information from the patients themselves and family members or other observers of the nocturnal events. Parasomnias are episodic sleep disorders that include sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares. All three conditions are more prevalent in childhood, when developmental factors appear to be responsible for their occurrence; in the much less frequent cases of a delayed onset or persistence in adulthood, psychopathologic states are often primary in their cause. Based on a number of clinical, physiologic, and etiopathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and night terrors, these two conditions appear to fall along the same pathophysiologic and therefore nosologic continuum. They are both disorders of impaired arousal, characterized by various degrees of confusion, and they occur early in the night when slow-wave sleep predominates, whereas nightmares may occur at any time of the night, because they are closely associated with REM sleep. Another important issue relating to the assessment of parasomnias is to differentiate between nightmares and night terrors: in addition to the different time of night for their occurrence, nightmares are accompanied by much less anxiety, vocalization, motility, and autonomic discharge. Also, nightmare patients usually have vivid and elaborate recall for the event, whereas patients with night terrors are typically amnesic for their episodes, as are patients who sleepwalk. A mainstay in the management of sleepwalking and night terrors is instructing the patients and their family members to provide for adequate safety measures to prevent accidents that may occur during these events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This is the format of most traditional classifications of sleep disorders. A modern classification has been introduced in 1990 and contains the description of 88 different sleep disturbances. They are classified in the main categories of dyssomnia, parasomnia and sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurological or somatic conditions. This classification is an excellent tool for the practice of sleep medicine and for the study of sleep disorders.",

Nocturnal choking sensation is a different symptom, for which we present two cases. Nocturnal choking sensation is a terrifying symptom for the patient and the diagnostic approach can be challenging. Aside from sleep choking syndrome, this symptom may appear with nocturnal laryngospasm, insular epilepsy and nocturnal gastro-oesophageal reflux. A thorough patient history and observation of the nocturnal event, sometimes supported by EEG findings, may provide the clue to the diagnosis. These kinds of nocturnal symptoms are best analyzed in a clinic specialized in both epilepsy and sleep disorders.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

The diaphragm is associated only with breathing, but many other functions are related to it. The patient is not always aware of the presence of diaphragmatic dysfunction, and it is not always immediate to identify non-respiratory diaphragmatic symptoms. Pseudoanginal pain, night sweats, difficulty memorizing, or muscular and visceral problems of the pelvic floor are just some of the disorders linked to reduced diaphragmatic contractility. A decline in respiratory contractile force can be the basis for further pathological conditions that can increase the rate of mortality and morbidity.

      "abstract": "Polysomnography is a whole-night simultaneous recording of several physiological parameters related to sleep and wakefulness. According to the classical standards for sleep stage scoring, it is necessary to record the electroencephalogram, the electrooculogram and electromyogram while a comprehensive sleep laboratory assessment should use a recording of a great number of physiological parameters. Polysomnographic characteristics of the whole-night sleep are described and illustrated in this review. Sleep without rapid eye movements or nonREM sleep consists of four stages that form a continuum from superticial to deep sleep. Sleep with rapid eye movements or REM sleep is characterized by a low amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) activity with mixed fast frequencies, muscle atonia and episodes of rapid eye movements. Main indications for polysomnography are various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias, circadian rhythm disorders, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, parasomnia, forensic psychiatric cases related to sleep, depression, sleep-related epilepsies, periodic leg movements during sleep. Sleep medicine is a multidisciplinary field including many medical disciplines, from psychiatry and neurology to intern medicine and paediatrics, as well as other sciences (from biology and genetics to psychology).",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

In 2004, hypnic headache wasincluded in group 4 (other primary headaches) ofthe 2nd edition of the International Classiﬁcation ofHeadache Disorders (ICHD-II) (2). According toICHD-II, subjects complaining of exclusively sleep-related dull headache can be diagnosed with hypnicheadache if at least two of the following arepresent: occurrence > 15 times per month; durationof pain for 15 min after waking; age at onset after50 years. In addition, absence of autonomic symp-toms, presence of not more than one of nausea,photophobia or phonophobia and exclusion ofanother disorder are required for diagnosing hypnicheadache.The pathogenesis of hypnic headache remainsunclear. Several possible mechanisms, includingdysfunction of brainstem neural networks, havebeen discussed (3).Polysomnographic studies have been performedin only 24 (22%) of the 109 reported cases of hypnicheadache, and 15 patients (14%) had an attackduring polysomnography (4). In 10 patients, theattacks showed a close temporal relation to rapideye movement (REM) sleep (5–10). In ﬁve patients,the attacks had an onset during non-REM sleep (9,11, 12).

The same sleep patterns and free running rhythms in healthy subjects have been seen in temporal isolation. The mechanism of this syndrome has not been clarified, but several factors have been proposed as follows: 1) the weakness of Zeitgeber 2) decrease of sensitivity to Zeitgeber 3) the period of the circadian system is much longer than 24 hours. Vitamin B12 and melatonin were reported to be effective in treating this syndrome.",

      "title": "Daytime functioning and quality of life in chronic insomnia: a multi-method, multi-level approach",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is characterised by difficulties with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Similar to most psychiatric and mental health conditions, insomnia is defined according to subjective complaint, and achieves disorder ‘status’ when associated daytime functioning impairment is present. Yet, ironically, it is these two cornerstones of insomnia disorder, combined, that have achieved relatively minimal attention in the literature. That is, perhaps surprisingly, the subjective experience, and impact of insomnia, at least from the patient (‘expert’) perspective, has been under-researched. Night-time symptoms and sleep parameters have typically been the target of both treatment and non-treatment (clinical, epidemiological, mechanistic) research.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, a multi-method, multi-level approach is adopted to better understand the daytime experience of those with chronically disturbed sleep. First, a brief overview (chapter one) of insomnia is provided to familiarise the reader with the ‘problem of insomnia’. A narrative review (chapter two) then sets the scene in relation to the assessment and measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and daytime functioning. This work reveals several inadequacies and limitations of existing work, and outlines a prospective research agenda. \r\n\r\nChapter three describes the first ever phenomenological study carried out in primary insomnia patients. Here, two qualitative methodologies, focus groups and audio-diaries, are combined to help better understand the proximal and distal impairments attributed to chronic sleep disturbance. Chapter four builds on this work by describing the creation of two new clinical scales, developed to quantify, in both valid and novel ways, the impact of poor sleep on aspects of daytime functioning and insomnia-related quality of life.\r\n\r\nChapter five combines the aforementioned qualitative and questionnaire approaches to explore the experience of an effective behavioural intervention for insomnia, sleep restriction therapy (SRT). The application of these refined methods provided insight into the effects of SRT on both sleep and daytime functioning, but also permitted exploration of treatment-related issues - such as adherence, side-effects, and mechanisms of action - that have otherwise been difficult to probe using traditional quantitative methodologies.\r\n\r\nChapter six tackles the issue of objective daytime impairment, typically assessed using computerised reaction time tasks. Through ‘mining’ an existing brain and behavioural database, and applying an algorithm to select poor and normal sleepers, it was possible to investigate cognitive functioning at two broad stages of processing – event-related potentials generated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), and performance output using neuropsychological testing. The results provide some interesting hypotheses concerning possible cognition-arousal and -effort interactions. Importantly, as a by-product of this work, a methodological template for the future standardized assessment of brain and behavioural function in insomnia is considered.\r\n\r\nFinally, chapter seven synthesises the results of each preceding experimental chapter, with particular emphasis on how this work will advance research, measurement and understanding of insomnia-related functioning. Immediate clinical implications and relevance to other areas of insomnia research are also briefly considered.",

      "title": "Sleep and prolonged epileptic activity (status epilepticus).",
      "abstract": "The correlations between sleep and prolonged epileptic activity are discussed on the basis of the status classification of Gastaut (1983). Little information is available on the interrelation of sleep and the status of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal status). Most important is the therapeutical management of these cases. Tonic seizures have been reported to occur in large numbers during NREM sleep in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A status-like increase is possible. Tonic seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep. Myoclonic status epilepticus arising (a) in the course of primary generalized epilepsy and (b) in the course of encephalopathies, are usually markedly attenuated during sleep. In absence status (petit mal status) synchronized sleep generally fragments the continuous discharge which is replaced by isolated bursts of polyspikes, or polyspike and wave complexes. The absence status can recur upon awaking during the night or in the morning. The abnormal EEG activity of a petit mal status can, however, occasionally persist during the whole night. Improvement as well as activation during sleep have been observed in elementary (= simple) partial status epilepticus; improvement seems to be more frequent. Epilepsia partialis continua may persist or decrease during sleep. An increase as well as decrease of motor phenomena has been observed during the REM stages. 'Epileptic aphasia' of childhood is associated with subclinical bioelectric status epilepticus during sleep. The electrical status epilepticus must be delineated as a separate group. The term encephalopathy related to electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES) has been proposed on the basis of associated psychic syndromes. This form of status epilepticus disappears during the waking state and during REM sleep. Cases with hypsarrhythmia without clinical signs may also be classified under the group of electrical or bioelectrical status. In some cases, a continuous hypsarrhythmia is observed only during sleep. In this context, one must also mention those patients who demonstrate continuous activation of spikes, or spike and wave potentials (without clinical seizures) during eye closure.",

The anomalies that have been found to be associated with arhinia are: lack of olfactory bulbs and nerves, missing paranasal sinuses, high arched or cleft palate, various eye anomalies, low set ears - all in a very high incidence. Various degrees of CNS malformations have been found in part of the cases. Somatic anomalies have been reported in 50% of the cases. In two cases chromosome 9 anomalies have been reported.

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with various quality of life concerns including poor sleep. Sleep impairments in children with AD are associated with increased risk of short stature, metabolic syndrome, mental illness and neurocognitive dysfunction. Although the association between AD and sleep disturbance is well established, the specific types of sleep disturbance in pediatric AD patients and their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A scoping literature review was performed to characterize and summarize the types of sleep disturbance in children (less than 18 years of age) with AD. 31 papers met inclusion criteria and extracted data were analyzed in an iterative manner. Two types of sleep disturbances were found to be more prevalent in pediatric AD patients in comparison to controls. One category was related to loss of sleep (increased frequency or duration of awakenings, increased sleep fragmentation, delayed sleep onset, decreased total sleep duration, and decreased sleep efficiency). Another category was associated with unusual behaviors during sleep (restlessness/limb movement/scratching, sleep-disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea and snoring, nightmares, nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal hyperhidrosis). Some mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances include pruritus and induced scratching and increased proinflammatory markers induced by sleep loss. Sleep disturbance appears to be associated with AD. We recommend clinicians to consider interventions that may reduce sleep disturbances in children with AD. Further investigation of these sleep disturbances is needed to elucidate pathophysiology, develop additional treatments, and reduce negative impacts on the health outcomes and quality of life in pediatric AD patients.",

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

Also ventilatory response to various stimuli including hypoxemia and hypercapnia is decreased.

The withdrawal of excitatory noradrenergic and serotonergic inputs to upper airway motor neurons during REM sleep increases the propensity for upper airway (UA) collapse. <b>Aims:</b> To evaluate the features of respiratory events by UA collapsibility estimated during REM sleep. <b>Methods:</b> Types (apnoea or hypopnoea) and duration of respitatory events, the degree of desaturation, occurrence and timing of arousals were determined with the diagnostic polysomnography. The proportion of apnoeas per total events (A ratio) in supine position during REM sleep was considered as UA collapsibility and three groups were categorized; mild(M, &lt; 0.3), moderate(Mo, 0.3 &lt; &lt;0.7), and severe (S, &gt; 0.7). <b>Results:</b> 78 male OSA patients with more than 15 per hour of AHI and without heart diseases and/or psychiatric disorders (Age 48±10 years, BMI 27.5 ± 5.1 kg/m2, AHI 38.6± 22.9 /h) were studied. There were no significant differences in age and BMI except AHI(M 24.9, Mo 27.2, S 42.6/h, median) among three groups (M 14, Mo 23, S 41 pts). In M group, no differences were seen in A ratio and the proportion of arousals per events between each sleep stage. There was more proportion of arousals per events during REM sleep in S group than other groups ( S 0.636 vs Mo 0.449, M 0.309, p&lt; 0.01). <b>Conclusion:</b> UA collapsibility estimated during REM sleep affects types of respiratory events and the proportion of arousals during sleep stages.

      "abstract": "Die sehr enge und ausgeprägte Beziehung zwischen zirkadianem Rhythmus und Epilepsie ist seit über einem Jahrhundert Gegenstand zahlreicher Untersuchungen. So konnten viele Einzelheiten der gegenseitigen Wechselwirkungen aufgeklärt werden und mittlerweile gibt es beträchtliches Wissen auf diesem Gebiet. Bei vielen Epilepsien werden Anfälle durch Schlaf oder Arousal aktiviert. Das Ausmaß dieser Aktivierung hängt von der Art der Epilepsie ab und ist bei den idiopathisch generalisierten Epilepsien am größten. Andererseits erhöht aber auch Schlafentzug die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Auftretens von Anfällen, wiederum bei bestimmten Epilepsiesyndromen häufiger als bei anderen. Bezogen auf das EEG kann interiktale epilepsietypische Aktivität häufiger im Schlaf gesehen werden, und zwar im Nonrapid-Eye-Movement-Schlaf. Neben einem Anstieg der Häufigkeit epilepsietypischer Potenziale kann auch deren Morphologie und Verteilung verändert werden, besonders bei generalisierten Potenzialen. Schlafentzug führt ebenfalls zu vermehrt auftretender epilepsietypischer Aktivität, sowohl im Wachen wie auch im Schlaf. Eine EEG-Ableitung nach Schlafentzug ist daher begründet, wenn bisherige Ableitungen Schlaf beinhalteten und keine epilepsietypischen Veränderungen zeigten. Dieser Übersichtsartikel stellt den Einfluss von Schlaf und Schlafentzug auf Anfälle und epilepsietypische Aktivität dar.",

      "abstract": "Background: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder, and it has been increasingly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. Methods: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5% female, 78.6% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m 2 , diabetes 5.8%, hypertension 20.0%, hyperlipidemia 17.9%, heart disease 2.6%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. Results: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13% [SD, 0.28%] vs 6.83% [SD, 0.26%], P = .035). Conclusion: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Summary Insufficient sleep syndrome possibly represents the worldwide leading cause of daytime sleepiness, but remains poorly recognised and studied. The aim of this case series is to comprehensively describe a cohort of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome. Eighty‐two patients were studied concerning demographic and socio‐economic features, medical, psychiatric and sleep comorbidities, substance use, sleep symptoms, actigraphy, video‐polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests and treatment. The typical patient with insufficient sleep syndrome is a middle‐aged adult (with no difference of gender), employed, who has a family, often carrying psychiatric and neurological comorbidities, in particular headache, anxiety and depression. Other sleep disorders, especially mild sleep apnea and bruxism, were common as well. Actigraphy was a valuable tool in the characterisation of insufficient sleep syndrome, showing a sleep restriction during weekdays, associated with a recovery rebound of night sleep during weekends and a high amount of daytime sleep. An over‐ or underestimation of sleeping was common, concerning both the duration of night sleep and daytime napping. The average daily sleep considering both daytime and night‐time, weekdays and weekends corresponds to the recommended minimal normal duration, meaning that the burden of insufficient sleep syndrome could mainly depend on sleep fragmentation and low quality. Sleep efficiency was elevated both in actigraphy and video‐polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests evidenced a tendency toward sleep‐onset rapid eye movement periods. Our study offers a comprehensive characterisation of patients with insufficient sleep syndrome, and clarifies their sleeping pattern, opening avenues for management and treatment of the disorder. Current options seem not adapted, and in our opinion a cognitive‐behavioural psychotherapy protocol should be developed.",

Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

      "abstract": "Hypersomnolence disorder is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep duration of idiopathic origin. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is frequently associated with hypersomnolence, but it is unclear whether hypersomnolence disorder and hypersomnolence associated with mood disorders are distinct entities, or if they share a common neurobiology. Thus, this study utilized ad libitum high-density (hd) EEG polysomnographic recordings to examine differences in sleep duration and continuity, as well as topographic alterations in SWA, which has been associated with the restorative aspects of sleep, in patients with and without hypersomnolence disorder, as well as with and without MDD, to clarify whether hypersomnolence is associated with transdiagnostic alterations in neurophysiological function. Eighty-three persons underwent 256-channel hdEEG polysomnography without prescribed wake time. Patients with MDD with (HYP+/MDD+) and without (HYP-/MDD+) comorbid hypersomnolence (n=22 each group), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; n=22) were recruited from a prospective study of hypersomnolence in mood disorders. Seventeen patients with hypersomnolence disorder without MDD (HYP+/MDD-) were drawn from a clinical sample. Clinical and sleep architecture variables were compared between groups. Topographic patterns of SWA relative to controls were also compared among disordered groups, and correlations between regional alterations in SWA and measures of sleepiness assessed. HYP+/MDD+ and HYP+/MDD- groups had similar sleep efficiency, stage distribution, and subjective sleepiness, and demonstrated similarly increased total sleep time relative to both HC and HYP-/MDD+ groups. HYP+/MDD+ and HYP+/MDD- also demonstrated reduced bilateral centroparietal SWA relative to HC, which was not observed for HYP-/MDD+ relative to HC. Slow wave activity in these regions also significantly negatively correlated with subjective measures of hypersomnolence. Reduced bilateral centroparietal SWA may be a transdiagnostic neurophysiologic finding in patients with unexplained hypersomnolence. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms through which these cortical changes are related to clinical complaints of daytime sleepiness. This research was supported by grants from the American Sleep Medicine Foundation, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, and NIMH (K23MH099234).",

      "abstract": "Hypertension and insomnia are very common and often coexist. There is evidence to suggest that the increasing prevalence of arterial hypertension in the past decade might be related both to an increased prevalence of insomnia and to the decline of sleep duration due to modern lifestyle. The aim of this paper is to reconsider both the clinical evidence of the relationship between conditions of sleep loss and of perceived impairment in sleep quality with hypertension and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the biological plausibility of their relationship. Through a systematic search from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO we selected articles, which reported experimental sleep deprivation designs, or studied sleep duration or insomnia and their relationship with blood pressure or hypertension in participants over 18 years. This analysis shows that experimental sleep deprivation, short sleep duration, and persistent insomnia are associated with increased blood pressure and increased risk of hypertension, even after controlling for other risk factors. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association might be related to inappropriate arousal (\"hyperarousal\") due to an overactivation of stress system functions. According this hypothesis, prolonged sleep loss or alterations of sleep quality might act as a neurobiological and physiologic stressor that impair brain functions and contribute to allostatic load, compromising stress resilience and somatic health.

      "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and may frequently be complicated by sleep disorders. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are commonly encountered in patients with COPD. Nocturnal hypoxemia is also prevalent in COPD may occur despite adequate awake oxygenation and can be especially severe in rapid eye movement sleep. Additionally, several factors--some of them unique to COPD--can contribute to sleep-related hypoventilation. Recognition of hypoventilation can be vital as supplemental oxygen therapy itself can acutely worsen hypoventilation and lead to disastrous consequences. Finally, accruing data establish an association between restless leg syndrome and COPD--an association that may be driven by hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Comorbid sleep disorders portend worse sleep quality, diminished quality of life, and multifarious other adverse consequences. The awareness and knowledge regarding sleep comorbidities in COPD has continued to evolve over past many years. There are still several lacunae, however, in our understanding of the etiologies, impact, and therapies of sleep disorders, specifically in patients with COPD. This review summarizes the latest concepts in prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of diverse sleep disorders in COPD.",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education.

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

REM behavior disorder (RBD), however, is reported to occur in only 12% to 36% of patients with narcolepsy. Use of RSWA has been proposed as an additional marker for narcolepsy diagnosis and as a tool to differentiate between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. We describe a case of narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) with RSWA on polysomnogram (PSG), but no RBD on PSG or by history. A 26 year old female with history of depression, anxiety, and migraine headaches presented with excessive daytime sleepiness requiring daytime naps since childhood. She endorsed sleep paralysis but not hypnagogic hallucinations, dream enactment or cataplexy. Sleep disordered breathing or other abnormalities were absent on overnight PSG. RSWA was seen, however, video recording did not reveal dream enactment behavior. The subsequent multiple sleep latency test showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes over 5 naps and 2 sleep onset REM periods. REM related motor findings occur at a higher frequency in patients with narcolepsy than in the general population. Hypocretin deficiency is believed to be the major determinant of REM sleep motor dysregulation observed in narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) are more frequently involved than patients with N-C. RBD associated with narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD in that it has equal gender predominance, earlier age at onset, and is associated with less violent and less complex behaviors. Interestingly, RSWA may be absent in RBD with narcolepsy. In addition, RSWA in narcolepsy is frequent even in the absence of RBD. This highlights the need to develop diagnostic criteria for RBD specific to the context of narcolepsy. RSWA is seen in high frequency in narcolepsy and should be strongly considered as a secondary diagnostic criteria.",

      "title": "Comorbid Insomnia and Sleep Apnea (COMISA): from research to clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) represents a prevalent and clinically significant overlap between the two most common sleep disorders: insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). COMISA is associated with greater impairment in sleep, daytime functioning, and physical and mental health compared to insomnia or OSA alone. Despite its prevalence, COMISA has historically been underrecognized, partially due to the conflicting symptoms of insomnia (e.g., hyperarousal and sleeplessness) and OSA (e.g., sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness). Recent research highlights that COMISA is not merely the coexistence of insomnia and OSA but may involve unique pathophysiological interactions and clinical phenotypes. This review explores the epidemiology, mechanisms, and clinical manifestations of COMISA. We examine insomnia as a potential extension of OSA, where repeated apneic events lead to conditioned hyperarousal, as well as OSA as an extension of chronic insomnia through mechanisms such as autonomic dysregulation and respiratory instability. Furthermore, we consider COMISA as a distinct entity, characterized by bidirectional interactions between the two conditions that exacerbate their clinical and physiological burden. Key challenges in diagnosing COMISA are discussed, including overlapping symptoms and limitations in current assessment tools. Emerging evidence suggests that COMISA is associated with increased cardiovascular and metabolic risks, greater mental health burden, and reduced treatment adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Advances in tailored therapeutic approaches, including combined cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and OSA management strategies, are highlighted as promising avenues to improve outcomes. Understanding COMISA as a multidimensional condition with diverse phenotypes and mechanisms underscores the need for integrated diagnostic frameworks and personalized treatment strategies to optimize patient care. Further research into its unique features and long-term consequences is critical to advancing clinical practice in sleep and respiratory medicine.",

      "title": "Commentary: Obstructive sleep apnoea as a risk factor for glaucoma",
      "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a type of sleep-disordered breathing that causes intermittent pauses in breathing during sleep, leading to transient nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia. Polysomnography is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common type, is due to complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Recurrent hypoxia due to desaturation and consequent arousal has several systemic effects affecting blood pressure, insulin resistance, autonomic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation.[1] Its severity is determined by the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) (total number of apnea and hypopnea events divided by total sleep time), based on which it is classified as mild, moderate, and severe OSA.[2] It is associated with increasing age and obesity, making it epidemiologically relevant due to an aging populace and rampant lifestyle disorders in most countries today.[3] The ocular diseases most frequently associated with OSA are floppy eyelid syndrome, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, glaucoma, central serous retinopathy, retinal vascular disorders, and dry eye disease. The relationship between OSA and glaucoma has been the subject of many studies. It is of specific interest as another modifiable risk factor in glaucoma, besides IOP. It assumes importance in normal pressure glaucoma (NPG) and progressive glaucoma, despite adequate IOP control. A meta-analysis of cross-sectional and case-control studies showed an increased prevalence of glaucoma among OSA patients (pooled odds ratio (OR): 1.242, P < 0.001) and OSA diagnosis in glaucoma patients (pooled OR: 1.746, P = 0.002).[4] More importantly, a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), lower ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC) on optical coherence tomography, and decreased vessel density of superficial and deep-layer peripapillary and macular area on optical coherence tomography angiography are reported in patients with greater OSA severity (higher AHI).[56] The current study also provides evidence of thinner RNFL and GCC with OSA compared to normal controls in Indians.[7] However, the exact pathophysiology of RNFL and GCC loss is unclear. There are multiple theories: (i) increased IOP due to supine posture, increased episcleral venous pressure, and autonomic dysfunction; (ii) optic nerve ischemia due to recurrent hypoxia; and (iii) vascular dysregulation at the optic nerve.[8] All of them remain to be proven. Other facts to be considered are that OSA patients are likely to have other comorbidities, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Vascular diseases, in particular, are likely to be independent risk factors for glaucoma. There is some evidence that vascular factors may be responsible for OSA-related damage in NPG. Chuang et al.[6] reported decreased vessel density of the superficial and deep-layer peripapillary and macular area in OSA patients with NPG and perimetric damage. Evaluation of the role of vascular dysregulation and peripheral hypoxia in OSA-related glaucoma would require prospective cohort studies in OSA patients. Though a clear relationship exists between OSA and NPG, high-pressure primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is also reported.[8] From a clinical standpoint, evaluating additional risk factors for glaucoma becomes essential in patients with rapidly progressive glaucoma (despite adequate control) and NPG. Thus, there may be a case for OSA evaluation by polysomnography, where indicated, in these patients. Obstructive sleep apnea treatment is lifestyle modification and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which may mitigate early glaucoma. There may be concerns about IOP variations with CPAP. However, Lin et al.[9] demonstrated some reversal of structural and functional changes after short-term (3 months) CPAP therapy. Thus, early and appropriate intervention in OSA-related glaucoma may be beneficial. Normal pressure glaucoma has a greater reported proportion among Asian (46.9%–92.3% of POAG) as compared to Western (30.0%–57.1% of POAG) countries, with similar data from South India (82%).[10] Thus, from an epidemiological standpoint, it would be important to study risk factors related to NPG in different populations. The estimated prevalence of OSA in India varies from 4.4% to 13.7% and is likely to rise with an aging population and increasing lifestyle diseases.[11] The current study is the first one from India that provides data regarding RNFL and ganglion cell complex changes in OSA.[7] Similar and extensive studies related to OSA and other potentially modifiable risk factors of glaucoma are the need of the hour.",

Subjects fell into three groups according to presence of insomnia symptom (s) and/or sleep dissatisfaction. Results Insomnia symptoms occurred in 36.2% of subjects. Most of these (75.9%), however, reported no sleep dissatisfaction. In comparison, those also with sleep dissatisfaction had higher prevalence of sleep and mental disorders and longer duration of insomnia symptoms, and were more likely to take sleep-promoting medication, dread bedtime, and complain of light sleep, poor night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness. Conclusions Insomnia sufferers differ as to whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with sleep. Although insomnia symptoms are common in the general population, sleep disturbances among sleep-dissatisfied individuals are more severe. Sleep dissatisfaction seems a better indicator of sleep pathology than insomnia symptoms.",

During a depressive phase, nine rapidly cycling patients were asked to simulate a 48-hour sleep-wake cycle by remaining awake for 40 hours (one night's total sleep deprivation). Eight switched out of depression, and seven were rated as manic or hypomanic; indicating that sleep loss (such as occurs with spontaneous 48-hour sleep-wake cycles) may help to trigger switches from depression to mania.

      "title": "Disordini respiratori durante il sonno nel paziente neuromuscolare",
      "abstract": "I disordini respiratori del sonno sono frequenti nel paziente neuromuscolare e possono essere consideratiun marker predittivo di interessamento respiratorio in senso lato. Pertanto, devono essere cercati sistematicamente e precocemente, soprattutto nelle malattie neuromuscolari rapidamente progressive e in presenza di sintomi suggestivi come apnee riferite, sonnolenza, cefalea al mattino, sonno non riposante. La conferma strumentale dell’interessamento respiratorio notturno avviene a mezzo del monitoraggio cardiorespiratorio notturno o della polisonnografia. Le principali alterazioni polisonnografiche nel paziente neuromuscolare sono: gli eventi diaframmatici o pseudocentrali, l’ipoventilazione notturna, le apnee ostruttive ed ipopnee, le apnee centrali ed il respiro periodico di Cheyne-Stokes. Lo pneumologo dovrebbe essere in grado di riconoscere tali eventi e anche le cosi dette “trappole”, cioe delle alterazioni polisonnografiche che rendono difficile l’identificazione dei diversi eventi favorendone la misclassificazione. Le attuali accomandazioni derivate da linee guida e documenti di consenso pongono la ventilazione non invasiva (NIV) domiciliare come un caposaldo del trattamento respiratorio delle malattie neuromuscolari. La ventilazione non invasiva ha dimostrato un miglioramento della sopravvivenza e della qualita del sonno; tuttavia, l’impostazione della terapia ventilatoria in questi pazienti appare complessa e necessita di costante monitoraggio e adattamento alla progressione di malattia.",

      "abstract": "Complex motor behaviors can be a challenge for even a seasoned physician. Opinions may be divided when behaviors occur out of sleep as general tendency is to categorize them as a parasomnia. A 43 y/o female with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was referred for a sleep study. She had severe OSA and a subsequent PAP titration study was performed. At 6 am, she had an arousal from N2 sleep with abduction of arms followed by writhing in bed. It was followed by flailing of arms in air with deviation of the eyes to the right. Later patient exhibited fast circling movements of the arms with chewing movements. Episode lasted for 25 seconds. Immediately after, patient was able to answer questions appropriately and walk without any difficulty suggesting no confusion. Limited EEG (done with PSG) was mostly obscured by muscle artifact and no clear epileptiform discharges could be discerned. No other abnormal EEG activity was noted during this sleep study prior to this event. She had similar behavior without any post event confusion on her sleep study 12 years ago. Patient demographic, clinical semiology and PSG/EEG features have been proposed to distinguish nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) seizures from parasomnias, validated guidelines are still missing. The short-lasting motor events cannot always be established as epileptic nature, on the basis of one event of clinical phenomena, but the recurrence of these similar observed movements in individuals can be used as an indirect marker of epileptic etiology. Distinguishing nocturnal epileptic seizures from parasomnias is critical from pathophysiological relationship but has treatment implications. This case illustrates importance of reviewing clinical history and behavior semiology that was recorded as well as limitations of the ancillary testing such as polysomnography or EEG monitoring.",

Diagnosis of the co-morbidity is the first step in treatment, followed by an assessment of the sleep disturbance. This begins with a complete history and physical examination, followed by laboratory testing such as polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and actigraphy. The treatment of sleep disorders caused by co-morbid conditions is discussed under seven categories, including the use of general measures (e.g., sleep hygiene, encouraging patients to develop good sleep habits, medication), treatment of the co-morbid condition, treatment of insomnia, treatment of excessive daytime somnolence, treatment of parasomnias, treatment of sleep-wake schedule disorders, and treatment of secondary or symptomatic restless legs syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The traditional diagnosis of sleep apnoea syndrome has been based on a particular apnoea frequency during sleep, and was originally set at ≥5 apnoeas·h-1 of sleep during the 1970s [1]. However, as experience developed with the clinical spectrum of patients with sleep apnoea, it was realized that hypopnoeas during sleep could have a similar clinical significance as complete apnoeas [2], and this realization led to the present clinical diagnostic criteria, which are based on the combined frequency of apnoeas and hypopnoeas during sleep. Unfortunately, there is not complete agreement as to what apnoea and hypopnoea frequency represents a clinically significant sleep apnoea syndrome, with some centres using a level of 10 episodes·h -1 [3‐5], and others 15 episodes·h -1 [6, 7]. A number of obvious deficiencies can be identified in the present approach to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Firstly, not all patients with an apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of greater than 10 or 15 episodes·h-1 of sleep appear to have a clinically significant OSA syndrome. It has long been recognized that apnoeas during sleep become more frequent with advancing age, and many apparently normal elderly people have an AHI greater than the above thresholds [8, 9]. It is now accepted that a diagnosis of clinically significant OSA should be accompanied by compatible symptoms, and not be based simply on an arbitrary AHI threshold, particularly in borderline cases. Clinically significant OSA can occur, particularly among younger patients, at AHI frequencies below 10 episodes·h-1, and the recent description of the upper airway resistance syndrome [10] indicates that episodic partial upper airway obstruction without significant hypopnoea can mimic OSA in most",

These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "abstract": "A minority of headache patients have a secondary headache disorder. The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

      "abstract": "We present a case of recurrent fearful isolated sleep paralysis in a 52-year-old male of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Recurrent sleep paralysis is a widely under-reported yet worrisome symptom of various sleep disorders. Although a benign condition in most cases, sleep paralysis in a minority of patients causes great distress. Some patients exhibit bedroom avoidance behavior, whereas others experience bedtime anxiety, making it difficult to fall asleep. This leads to poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, which can greatly impact a person's overall health. As in our case, this led to a vicious \"lack of sleep\" cycle where a patient who had bedtime anxiety and could not fall asleep, owing to his recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, also had poor quality sleep secondary to his OSA. This increases morbidity and has many potential consequences, which may include cardiovascular events, cognitive decline, and motor vehicular accidents. Sometimes, simply addressing the underlying medical condition cures the recurrent sleep paralysis as in this case where continuous positive airway pressure for OSA cured the recurrent sleep paralysis. One of our goals is to raise awareness of recurrent sleep paralysis so that patients can seek medical help and would not have to live with the anguish of the condition. Coming forward will also assist medical researchers in furthering their understanding of sleep paralysis.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to newborns, who spend 16–20 h in sleep each day, adults need only about sleep daily. However, many elderly may struggle to obtain those 8 h in one block. In addition to changes in sleep duration, sleep patterns change as age progresses. Like the physical changes that occur during old age, an alteration in sleep pattern is also a part of the normal ageing process. As people age, they tend to have a harder time falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep. Older people spend more time in the lighter stages of sleep than in deep sleep. As the circadian mechanism in older people becomes less efficient, their sleep schedule is shifted forward. Even when they manage to obtain 7 or 8 h sleep, they wake up early, as they have gone to sleep quite early. The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher among older adults. Loud snoring, which is more common in the elderly, can be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea, which puts a person at risk for cardiovascular diseases, headaches, memory loss, and depression. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that disrupt sleep are more prevalent in older persons. Other common medical problems of old age such as hypertension diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma, immune disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, physical disability, dementia, pain, depression, and anxiety are all associated with sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders including insomnia, sleep apnea and circadian rhytym disruption are common among older adults. We prospectively examined the association between objectively measured sleep disorders and subsequent cognitive function and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. We studied 1309 women (mean age, 82.3 ± 3.2) who were enrolled in an ongoing prospective study and completed several days of wrist actigraphy and a subset (N = 298) with overnight polysomnography (PSG). Approximately 5 years later, we assessed cognitive outcomes including a neuropsychological test battery and adjudicated clinical cognitive status (normal, MCI or dementia). Sleep parameters of interest included: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score ≥ 15 events/hr to define sleep disordered breathing (SDB); sleep fragmentation, as manifested by greater nighttime wakefulness after onset (WASO); total sleep time (TST); and circadian rhythm acrophase shift. Women with SDB had more than twice the odds of developing MCI/dementia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28 - 4.25) compared to women without SDB. Increased risk of MCI/dementia (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI, 1.22-2.45) was also observed for women with a delayed acrophase (>1 SDfrom mean) when compared to those with average acrophase timing. Women with greater nighttime wakefulness had greater likelihood of impaired performance on a test of global cognition (adjusted OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.16- 4.87), verbal fluency (adjusted OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.10- 4.28) and delayed verbal recall (adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94,-3.54). TST was not associated with cognitive impairment. Sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment 5-years later in older women. These findings suggest that older adults should be monitored for sleep disturbances and that interventions designed to improve sleep need to be investigated with particular attention to cognitive outcomes.",

      "title": "Sleep and Sleep-Wake Manipulations in Bipolar Depression",
      "abstract": "In the last 30 years, it has been convincingly demonstrated that sleep in major depression is characterized by disturbances of sleep continuity, a reduction of slow wave sleep, a disinhibition of REM sleep including a shortening of REM latency (i.e. the time between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period) and an increase in REM density. Furthermore, manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle like total or partial sleep deprivation or phase advance of the sleep period have been proven to be effective therapeutic strategies for patients with unipolar depression. The database concerning sleep and sleep-wake manipulations in bipolar disorder in comparison is not yet as extensive. Studies investigating sleep in bipolar depression suggest that during the depressed phase sleep shows the same stigmata as in unipolar depression. During the hypomanic or manic phase, sleep is even more curtailed, though subjectively not experienced as disturbing by the patients. REM sleep disinhibition is present as well. An important issue is the question, whether sleep-wake manipulations can also be applied in patients with bipolar depression. Work by others and our own studies indicate that sleep deprivation and a phase advance of the sleep period can be used to treat bipolar patients during the depressed phase. The risk of a switch into hypomania or mania does not seem to be more pronounced than the risk with typical pharmacological antidepressant treatment. For patients with mania, sleep deprivation is not an adequate treatment--in contrast, treatment strategies aiming at stabilizing a regular sleep-wake schedule are indicated.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a complicated chronic disease caused by certain reasons, characterized by obstruction of the upper airway and apnea or hypopnea during sleep, which can be followed by anoxia, snoring and daytime sleepiness. Recent studies have shown that hypertension is closely connected to OSAS. OSAS can lead to hypertension by several possible mechanisms. The diagnosis of OSAS mainly depends on the medical history, sign, polysomnogram (PSG) result and the frequency of apnea and hypopnea. OSAS can be relieved by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral orthodontic treatment, medicine, change of lifestyles and others. This brief review focuses on the mechanism of hypertension due to OSAS and the diagnosis criteria and treatment of OSAS. 阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征(obstructive sleep apnea syndrome，OSAS)是一种常见但易被忽视的疾病，是由于某些原因引起上呼吸道阻塞而出现睡眠呼吸暂停并伴有缺氧、鼾声、白天嗜睡等症状的慢性睡眠呼吸障碍性疾病。OSAS与高血压密切相关，可能通过多种机制引起高血压的发生。OSAS的诊断主要依据患者的病史、体征及多导睡眠图监测结果，如睡眠呼吸暂停和低通气次数。主要可通过持续气道内正压通气、口腔矫正、药物及改变生活方式等进行改善与治疗。.",

Psychotic depressive subjects also were more likely to have extremely short sleep-onset REM latencies. In psychotic depression EEG sleep varied as a function of total illness duration. Patients with recent-onset syndromes had profiles characterized by marked initial insomnia, Increased stage 1 sleep percentage, and long REM latency; patients with illnesses of longer duration had extremely short REM latencies.

In the present study, these clinical manifestations were assessed in apneic patients before and 6 months after treatment with nasally applied continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP treatment was found to restore normal respiration during sleep and to normalize sleep organization. Daytime vigilance greatly improved with treatment but some degree of somnolence as compared to normal controls persisted. Similarly, most neuropsychological deficits normalized with treatment. The exception was for planning abilities and manual dexterity, two neuropsychological deficits that have been found to be highly correlated with the severity of nocturnal hypoxemia. These results raise the possibility that anoxic brain damage is a pathogenic factor in severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.",

OSAS involves the existence of at least 5 breathing breaks of at least 10 seconds in a sleeping hour. OSAS etiologic factors are numerous, the most important being the increased body weight of patients (a high percentage of 50% of patients with OSAS with different degrees of obesity), age (OSAS is diagnosed in middle-aged people), craniofacial deformities, multiple pathologies leading to narrowing of the upper airways, gender (is more common in men), genetic causes (more common in black and Hispanic people), alcohol, tobacco, hypnotic and sedative medications. Symptoms of OSAS are characterized by daytime and night-time symptoms. Of the daytime symptoms, patients frequently report headache and morning fatigue, daytime somnolence, memory impairment and concentration. Of the nocturnal symptoms, the most common symptoms experienced by patients are snoring and repeated episodes of apnea. Patients also report nocturia, polakiuria, decreased libido, symptoms that are often attributed to other pathologies. Due to concentration disturbances and low cognitive performance among patients with OSAS, they will experience a decrease in work capacity, which is reflected by the loss of work, reflected by the decrease in the number of working days. OSAS treatment is complex, different depending on the severity of the disease and the existing comorbidities of the patient.",

We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73‐year‐old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep–wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities.

It is this fragmentation that is believed to be an important factor affecting impaired daytime wakefulness. Studies have suggested a strong association between sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness (55). Treatment studies also demonstrate a close link between sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness. Reduced frequency of arousals from sleep with resultant reduction in the level of sleepiness is commonly seen in patients who are successfully treated for sleep apnea, whereas those who do not subjectively beneﬁt from treatment show no decrease in arousals or sleepiness, despite improved sleeping oxygenation. It must, however, be stressed that lack of fragmented sleep does not exempt one from feeling sleepy. Partial sleep deprivation may occasionally be seen in patients who are unable to sustain sleep from repeated sleep disruption. This is commonly seen in patients with anxiety predispositions or superimposed insomnia.",

Dream-enacting behaviors can also occur in patients with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This clinical situation has been termed âpseudo-RBDâ. In contrast, OSA causes frequent arousal, which may consequently result in masking of RBD symptoms. We reported two patients with severe OSA, who were initially diagnosed with âpseudo-RBDâ but on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration, rediagnosed with âtrue-RBDâ. When RBD is clinically suspected but is not confirmed by diagnostic overnight polysomnography, we have to keep in mind that RBD could be detected during CPAP titration.

More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

First, the concept of sleep disturbance in a public health context is introduced, to provide context and rationale. Second, operational definitions of 'cardiometabolic disease' and 'sleep disturbance' are offered, to address many unclear operationalizations. Third, the extant literature is summarized regarding short or long sleep duration and/or insufficient sleep, insomnia and insomnia symptoms, general (non-specific sleep disturbances), circadian rhythm abnormalities that result in sleep disturbances, and, briefly, sleep-disordered breathing. Fourth, the review highlights the social/behavioural context of sleep, including discussions of sleep and race/ethnicity, socio-economic position, and other social/environmental factors, in order to place these findings in a social-environmental context relevant to public health. Fifth, the review highlights the issue of sleep as a domain of health behaviour and addresses issues regarding development of healthy sleep interventions.

Most patients are over the age of 50 and usually awake at the same time at night with dull bilateral head pain. The pathophysiology of this headache disorder is still enigmatic but association with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been suggested. Methods: Six patients with HH according to the current International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) criteria (code 4.5) were investigated. Serial polysomnography (PSG) was performed in each patient for four consecutive nights. Results: A total of 22 HH attacks were recorded from all patients during PSG. Six of the monitored headache attacks arose from REM sleep; 16 attacks, however, arose from different non-REM (NREM) sleep stages. Five patients showed an increased apnoea/hypopnoea index (&gt;5), indicating obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on some but not the majority of nights. Headache onset and occurrence of SDB were not temporally connected. Conclusions: This prospective study shows that the onset of HH was not associated with sleep stage. These results contradict the current belief that REM sleep and SDB play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of HH.",

Die exzessive Schläfrigkeit sollte gegenüber Müdigkeit und Energielosigkeit, wie sie meist im Zusammenhang mit intern-medizinischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen auftreten, abgegrenzt werden. Die Hypersomnie tritt in der erwachsenen Bevölkerung mit einer Häufigkeit von 2–5% auf und kann zu Arbeitslosigkeit, Unfällen und neuropsychiatrischen Störungen führen. Zu den häufigsten Ursachen einer Hypersomnie zählen das Schlaf-apnoe Syndrom (SAS), die Narkolepsie, das chronische Schlafmanko (sog. Schlafinsuffizienz) sowie das Restless legs-/periodic limb movements in sleep – Syndrom (RLS/PLMS). Die Verdachtsdiagnose ergibt sich oftmals schon aus dem klinischen Beschwerdebild. Dennoch sind eine Polysomnographie und ein Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) für die definitive Diagnosestellung oft notwendig. Therapeutisch stehen die nasale CPAP-Therapie beim SAS, Stimulantien bei der Narkolepsie, eine Verlängerung der Schlafdauer bei der chronischen Schlafinsuffizienz und Dopaminagonisten beim RLS/PLMS zur Wahl.",

The boundaries between waking and REM sleep become blurred resulting in REM phenomena in wakefulness and features of wakefulness during sleep. Narcolepsy is not rare, with a prevalence of 25–50/100,000 in Western Europe, however many individuals remain undiagnosed for many years after the onset of symptoms [1]. One third of adults with narcolepsy describe their first symptoms appearing before the age of 15 and there is a clear peak of onset in the teenage years [2]. The classic narcolepsy tetrad comprised excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotion, most frequently laughter), sleep paralysis and hypnagogic (on falling asleep) and hypnopompic (on waking) hallucinations. Disturbed nighttime sleep was often added to make up a pentad. These symptoms apart from excessive daytime sleep and cataplexy are not uncommon in unaffected individuals and other sleep disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders defines narcolepsy without cataplexy as excessive daytime sleepiness and multiple sleep onset REM periods on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) [3]. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with a deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin, a",

The EEG, submental EMG and heart rate as well as respiration were recorded continuously during the sleep periods. Eye movements, however, as they are not detectable by electric recording, were observed visually. In our 4 cases of blind children eye movements disappeared during sleep and sleep stages characterized by desynchronized EEG were found to be reduced.

Infant sleep apnea includes three entities: (1) apnea of prematurity, (2), apparent life threatening episodes with apnea and (3) obstructive sleep apnea. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be associated with other autonomic system illness, such as Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome) and neuroblastoma. The implementation of the supine sleep position and smoking free homes has diminished the frequency of sudden infant death syndrome. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus should be considered in all newborns with a normal exam between the episodes when they always occur during sleep. This entity may be mistaken for status epilepticus, because it is associated with increases in heart rate. Benzodiazepines prolongs the duration of the episodes.",

Sleep attacks were characterized by lid fluttering and closure, upward turning of the eyes, rapid eye movements, myoclonic twitching of all extremities, and loss of consciousness, lasting one or two minutes and aborted by strong sensory stimulation. At their termination, reports of hallucinoid imagery were given. In a sleep record of 6.5 hours, there were 2.2 hours awake (34%), 4.3 hours desynchronized sleep (66%), and a complete absence of synchronized sleep. Reports of hallucinoid imagery were given after awakenings from desynchronized sleep. The findings support the hypotheses that desynchronized sleep is normally under brain stem control and that some types of narcolepsy may be pathophysiologically related to desynchronized sleep.",

En effet, le syndrome fut decouvert au cours des annees 70 et ce n’est qu’en 1981 que le traitement phare de cette affection fut mis au point : la Pression Positive Continue. Ce traitement permet de controler le symptome caracteristique de cette pathologie qui est la somnolence diurne excessive. On parle de traitement palliatif car il n’y a pas de guerison complete du syndrome. De plus, les etudes demontrent que l’esperance de vie des malades avec ce traitement est quasi equivalente a celle de la population generale. Le syndrome d’apnees du sommeil est un trouble respiratoire nocturne. Il correspond a la repetition d’arret respiratoire, total ou partiel, pendant le sommeil. Il existe plusieurs types d’apnees du sommeil, la forme la plus frequente est l’apnee obstructive du sommeil. Ces arrets sont donc dus a l’obstruction des voies aeriennes superieures empechant l’air d’entrer dans les poumons durant la duree de l’apnee. L’obstruction est liee a un collapsus inspiratoire du pharynx. Ces troubles se repetent plusieurs fois au cours d’une meme nuit avec des durees qui varient de quelques secondes a plusieurs minutes. La reprise de la respiration se fait de facon bruyante s’accompagnant d’un bref eveil, encore appele micro-eveil, non memorise dans la plus part des cas mais dont l’impact perturbe la qualite du sommeil. Cette reprise ventilatoire bruyante est accompagnee de ronflements intenses et quotidiens. Ce sont ces elements qui ! amenent les personnes a consulter et qui oriente le diagnostic. Enfin, le syndrome d’apnees du sommeil est une maladie frequente, evolutive, sournoise dont l’impact au niveau de la qualite de vie n’est pas negligeable. L’interet d’un depistage rapide permettant une prise en charge multidisciplinaire et efficiente de cette maladie chronique est donc necessaire.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent condition, affecting up to 20% of the population in first world countries [1]. The obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is diagnosed when symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence or cognitive impairment are present in the context of an elevated apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) per hour of sleep. The definitions vary according to the lower cut-off for the AHI, which can range from >5 to >15 events per hour [2]. However, as with any sleep disorder, it is important to establish whether the sleep disordered breathing (SDB) per se is the true cause of symptoms of daytime somnolence. As is apparent to everyone who practises in the area, a large number of other factors can intervene, such as shift work, sleep insufficiency, psychiatric disorders, metabolic disorders and nutritional deficiencies, which may be the true cause of the somnolence rather than the AHI as measured on polysomnography. Additionally, a true AHI cannot be reported on the basis of any respiratory measurements conducted during sleep, if no electroencephalogram is simultaneously recorded [2]. OSA patients' risk of RTA should be assessed using detailed driving history with specific focus on \"red flags\" <http://ow.ly/mxPi305isni>",

This syndrome is characterized by nocturnal respiratory disturbances, blood oxygen desaturations, sleep fragmentation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Opinions arc divided concerning the exact relationship between the observed cognitive deficits, nocturnal hypoxia, sleep disruption, and impaired daytime alertness. In the present study, morning neuropsychological function of 26 moderate to severe middle-aged sleep apneics is compared to that of 22 primary insomniacs. There were no performance differences on a range of neuropsychological tests among the two patient groups. In addition, the data suggest that morning alertness impairment, which is closely associated with a lack of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is of major importance in inducing poorer cognitive performance in patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea.

Asking about typical bedtime rituals, sleep times and habits is a good place to start in the assessment of any sleep disorder. Many people who present with the classic symptom of insomnia may have more than one problem with sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), parasomnias, narcolepsy, and nocturnal seizures sometimes require formal evaluation in the sleep laboratory. The most commonly used techniques used in recording and evaluating sleep disorders include the polysomnogram (PSG), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and under special circumstances, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT).",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a potentially life-threatening medical disorder. Approximately 2–26% of the general population suffers with some form of sleep disordered breathing. There are different phenotypes of obstructive sleep apnea. Approximately 56% of the patients diagnosed with OSA have a position-dependent phenotype. A difference of 50% or more in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between the supine and nonsupine positions is considered a supine-dependent phenotype. It then becomes extremely important to recognize the presence of positional phenotype as much improvement can be accomplished to support other more definitive therapies like noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP, auto-PAP), mandibular advancement device (MAD, also called oral appliance [OAT]), a variety of surgical interventions, and hypoglossal nerve stimulation. Positional therapy has a significant supportive role in the management of the spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea. In addition to lifestyle accommodations such as weight loss, other options include avoidance of sedatives and alcohol and sleeping in a nonsupine position if supine-position-dependent sleep apnea is suggested by the polysomnography. The incidence and intensity of the snoring is known to decrease in lateral sleep positions rather than the supine position. A reasonably sized body of medical literature supports the use of positional devices since 1984. A well-known method is to sew a pocket in the back of the T-shirt and put a tennis ball or similar object in it so that discomfort wakes the individuals or forces sleeping on the side if they turn on their back. This chapter reviews the current status of the use of oral appliance therapy in the management of obstructive sleep apnea. Current guidelines published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend oral appliances for patients with mild to moderate OSA who prefer them to positive airway pressure therapy (PAP), who do not respond to PAP, who are not appropriate candidates for PAP, or who fail treatment attempts with PAP. Oral appliances may be considered for use in patients with severe OSA after first attempting to treat with PAP.",

Sleep breathing signs and symptoms were studied in 178 adults—all with SDB—including typical sleep clinic patients (N = 89) reporting classic snoring and sleepiness and crime victims (N = 89) with insomnia and posttraumatic stress. Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were common between groups. Sleep breathing complaints, loud snoring, marked obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea were prevalent in sleep clinic patients; crime victims reported more insomnia, nightmares, poor sleep quality, leg jerks, cognitive-affective symptoms, psychotropic medication usage, and less snoring but more upper airway resistance syndrome. Both groups reported high rates of fatigue or sleepiness, nocturia, morning dry mouth, and morning headaches. Awareness of these clinical features might enhance detection of SDB among trauma survivors.",

Plasma levels of pituitary and other hormones also spontaneously fl uctuate across the 24-hour period. These endocrine rhythms have often been labeled either sleep-related (when the predominant change in fl uctuation is nocturnal) or circadian (when the rhythm appears to be regulated by an internal clock rather than periodic changes in the external environment). Both circadian and sleep infl uences interact to varying degrees to produce the characteristic 24-hour rhythm of each hormone.

      "abstract": "Respiratory disorders are a big issue that affects around 60% of the population all over the world. It varies from simple snoring up to severe stridor which appears mainly during sleep. The cause of all respiratory disorders depends on obstruction, vibration or both. We can also find respiratory disorders in some rare cases like Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome or Multisystem Disease. The respiratory events start with simple snoring without symptoms of dyspnea or hypopnea. It may extend to arousals due to respiratory efforts (RERAs Syndrome).\r\n\r\n\tWith more and more distress, the hypopnea (decrease in Oxygen) appears till complete apnea occurs with awakened stridor. The most common sequence of events in sleep respiratory disorders can be summarized into the following; simple snoring which leads to the increase in upper airway resistance and finally ending in a group of syndromes like OSAS (Apnea, Hypopnea, RERAs). In another sequence, snoring leads to Uvular Oedema which feels like morning Obstructive Sleep Hypopnea Apnea Syndrome (ObSHAS). This leads to increase in Arterial Hypertension which causes daytime sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\tThere are a lot of complications in OSAS which maybe local complications in mouse, nose and chest, or CVS complications like Erythema or Hypertension or psychological problems like dizziness or loss of consciousness or daytime sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\tOne of the most common problems is how to exactly detect the size and site of the obstruction of air flow. There are several methods like full history of the patient and the partner, full clinical examination, full radiological examination or fiber-optic endoscopic examination. The treatment is either medical or surgical according to the case.",

The combined treatment led to a better result than would have been expected from drug therapy alone. Some of the sleep deprivation treatments effected an accelerated remission without the efficacy of treatment subsiding.

[1] have emphasized the high prevalence of hypnagogic and/or hypnopompic hallucinations present respectively in 37 and 12.5% of the 4972 subjects. The rate of hypnagogic hallucinations was related to age. Women were more likely to report such hallucinations. The most frequent type of hallucinations was unexpected, that is kinesthesic (feeling of falling in an abyss) but all types of hallucinations could be present. These hallucinations had no relationship to a specific pathology in more than 50% of the cases but were exclusively present at nighttime. In old age, visual hallucinations are the most frequent. In a cohort of old non-demented subjects, 17.4% of them had hallucinations and behavioural symptoms (anxious agitation or/and irritability). Several neurological pathologies included sleep disorders and hallucinations. Narcolepsy and Parkinson disease (P.D.) will be only considered here. In narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy, hallucinations are now called “secondary” symptom, as they are incidental, reported in 35 to 66% of the patients. Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are most often visual but all types have been described, formed, without whole scenes but terrifying the patient who is often implicated in it and sometimes associated with sleep paralysis, especially during daytime when sleep occurs in REM. Are they pieces of dream? These hallucinations can be differentiated on a phenomenological basis from hallucinations in healthy subjects and from hallucinations in schizophrenia [2]. They have also some differences with hallucinations observed in P.D. [3]. In P.D. hallucinations affected 25% of the patients in long duration disease. They are mainly visual, or with sensation of a presence (person or animal), coexisting with delusions and anxiety. They are rarely only a side- effect of dopaminergic treatment but are often linked to daytime sleepiness with REM sleep attacks, described in this disease and to cognitive impairment.",

The insidious, chronic course of most sleep disorders and lack of patient awareness of signs and symptoms during sleep can complicate the clinical evaluation. Typical chief complaints include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and behaviors during sleep. Sleep disorders can be primary or secondary to medical, neurologic, or psychiatric conditions, so a multidisciplinary approach is often desirable. Family members can be a critical source of information as they may have observed nocturnal or daytime symptoms unrecognized by the patient. Objective testing plays an important role in assessment for obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnias, and other specific sleep disorders, and can be used most effectively in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation. Nonsleep specialists should consider obtaining assistance from sleep clinicians for more challenging presentations or management of sleep disorders unfamiliar to them.",

      "title": "Ubiquitous Health Monitoring System for Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea With Zigbee Network and Wireless LAN",
      "abstract": "The Greek word “apnea” literally means “without breath.” The three types of apnea are obstructive, central, and mixed. Obstructive is the most common type. Despite the difference in the root cause of the three types of apnea, people with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night and often for 1 min or longer. Sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases, memory problems, weight gain, impotency, and headaches. Sleep apnea may be responsible for job impairment and motor vehicle accidents. Apart from the physical health risks, sleep apnea can lead to social problems when left undiagnosed or untreated such as a high amount of unnecessary health care cost. Sleep disorder is diagnosed with polysomnography, an overnight sleep study, by monitoring electrical activity of brain, heart, eye movement, muscle activity, breathing pattern, and other physiological signals. Because polysomnography requires overnight monitoring by a sleep technologist with full sleep staging, polysomnography is expensive, inconvenient, time consuming, and labor intensive. Although some systems provide home based diagnosis, most systems record the sleep data in a memory card. The patient must send the memory card to a medical center through the mail or internet. The real-time monitoring is not performed and a patient can experience life threatening episodes by not receiving proper feedback from a medical center or a physician. We propose a wireless health monitoring system to diagnose sleep apnea, which enables the global monitoring of biomedical signals. A patient does not need hospitalization and can be diagnosed and receive feedback at home. The system supports monitoring five different biomedical signals to diagnose sleep apnea: electrocardiogram with dry electrodes (no gel), body position, nasal airflow, abdomen/chest efforts and oxygen saturation. The system consists of three units: a wireless transmitter, a wireless receiver, and a monitoring unit. A wireless transmitter unit sends the measured signals from sensors to a receiver unit with Zigbee communication. The receiver unit, which has two wireless modules, Zigbee and Wi-Fi, receives signals from the transmitter unit and retransmits signals to the remote monitoring system with Zigbee and Wi-Fi communication, respectively. By using both the Zigbee network and wireless LAN, the system can achieve low power consumption in a local monitoring area with the feature of the Zigbee standard. The system also provides wide data coverage and easily extends its sensor network to the Internet with the Wi-Fi standard. The features of the system and the results of the continuous monitoring of vital signals are presented.",

Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea can worsen epilepsy, with improvement of seizure control following appropriate treatment of the sleep disorder. Conversely, epilepsy and antiepileptic medication can worsen sleep disorders. Nocturnal epileptic seizures may be difficult to differentiate from parasomnias, in particular non-rapid eye movement parasomnias such as night terrors, sleepwalking and confusional arousals, on history alone since there are semiologic similarities between the two disorders.

      "abstract": "Twenty-four-hour sleep patterns of 50 male alcohol addicts were assessed behaviorally during a 5-day base-line period, a 7- to 62-day period of spontaneous drinking and a subsequent alcohol withdrawal phase. Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

      "title": "Central s sleep a apnoea, p pathogenesis a and ttreatment: a an o overview and p perspective",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of reported sleep disturbances in a general popula- tion is high. Many of the complaints are the result of sleep-related breathing dis- orders, due mainly to the occurrence of obstructive and central apnoeas. Obstructive sleep apnoea is a fully described and well-recognized entity. Central sleep apnoea (CSA) however, has been poorly studied. There is accumulating evidence that central sleep apnoea should be considered as the end of a spectrum. Instability in the breathing pattern is the main under- lying mechanism and is due to the interaction of many factors. Breathing during sleep is dependent on metabolic control and the activity of the respiratory muscles. Decreased chemical drive and/or failing respiratory muscle function are associated with CSA and usually also with ongoing hypoventilation during wakefulness, char- acterized by chronic daytime hypercapnia. Central respiratory drive can also be inhibited by upper airway reflexes. Mostly, however, CSA occurs as the hallmark of unstable breathing during sleep brought about by an overall increase in loop gain (especially in light sleep stages) and the unmasking of a CO 2 threshold. Arousal following central apnoeas acts as an amplification of the instability. Micro electroencephographic (EEG) arousals are often observed as a consequence of CSA. They are responsible for sleep fragmentation and hypersomnolence during the day. The daytime hypersomnolence and complaints of awakenings during sleep in patients with CSA can be striking. CSA can occur in specific pathologies, such as chronic heart failure and (post-traumatic) brain lesions, that are associated with irregular breathing. Treatment strategies are remarkably few in number. Use of nasal ventilation and the inhalation of CO 2 are mainly of theoretical interest, since patients do not often tolerate these more invasive therapies. Drug treatment, especially with aceta- zolamide, is easier to perform. Stimulation of upper airway reflexes, by less inva- sive methods, seems to be promising for the near future.",

      "abstract": "The severe limitations of conventional sleep staging during sleep apnea are now understood. Micro-arousals are likely to be the dominant cause of symptoms in sleep apnea, but it has been extremely difficult to quantify them in a way that will predict daytime sleepiness or poor vigilance any better than respiratory indices. It is clear that not all apneas are equal in their effect on sleep, differences in the degree of arousal required to end an apnea and open the pharynx may help to explain why some individuals with apnea-plus-hypopnea indices (AHIs) of 15 may be symptomless, whereas others are severely disabled. Use of newer techniques to measure arousals, both cortical and autonomic, may produce a better understanding of how to measure sleep.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Despite an initial sedative effect, alcohol disrupts sleep persistently and should not be used as a sleeping aid. Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

Parasomnias can affect people of any age-infants, newborns, and even fetuses (as described in the documentary Sleep Runners: The Stories Behind Everyday Parasomnias []). It is believed that the kicking of a fetus in utero is a manifestation of \"spontaneous motility patterns,\" that is, the most primitive form of motor activation-without concurrent inhibition-during primordial sleep ().

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for human survival since it helps to restore and maintain our bodies' immune systems and other essential processes. One-third of a person's life is devoted to sleeping, although few are aware of the many positive aspects of this activity. Two distinct types of sleep, REM and NREM, have been identified. A good night's rest is achieved when REM and NREM sleep alternate in a regular pattern. Disruptions to this cycle, whether they originate physiologically or psychologically, have been linked to a variety of health problems. Polysomnography (PSG) equipment is often used in sleep labs inside hospitals to perform sleep studies. A polysomnogram is an in-depth medical technique that records a patient's vital signs while they sleep and necessitates a hospital stay. Clinically, sleep apnea is defined as a breathing disease in which there are periodic pauses in breathing lasting 10 seconds or more that occur more than five times during the night. Sleep apnea may be classified as either Obstructive, Central, or Mixed. The prevalent sleep problem known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the upper airway during sleep. The purpose of this study is to provide a technique for screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea by analysing Heart Rate Variability of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data while the subject is asleep. The goals of this study are to create computational approaches for identifying OSA based on characteristics extracted from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals derived from sleep electrocardiograms (ECGs). Physio Net's Apnea-ECG recordings serve as the source for the ECG data.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep paralysis is one of the many conditions of which visual hallucinations can be a part but has received relatively little attention. It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

Assessing sleeping problems and enhancing sleep quality are critical first steps to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment. Objective: To review existing literature based on predefined eligibility criteria to understand the connection between sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A thorough and systematic evaluation of numerous studies was carried out to assess one or more of the following epidemiological factors: (1) sleep disorders, (2) cognitive impairment, and (3) risk estimates for cognitive impairment due to sleep. Results: Studies suggest that individuals who experience memory loss may encounter sleep disturbances before noticing other symptoms. Numerous sleep disorders, such as excessive and inadequate sleep duration, poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm abnormalities, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea were found to increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Additionally, lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration have been linked to higher cerebral-β-amyloid levels. Objective evidence for the development of cognitive impairment is provided by the architecture of sleep stages. Patients experiencing sleep problems may benefit from specific types of sleep medicine as a preventative measure against cognitive decline. Conclusion: Sleep disorders can have adverse effects on cognitive health. The duration and quality of sleep are fundamental factors for maintaining a healthy brain as we age. Proper sleep can aid prevent cognitive impairment, particularly Alzheimer's disease and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Anxious arousals originate from all sleep stages and can be classified as: a) stage 4 night terrors; b) rapid eye movement (REM) nightmares; c) stage 2 awakenings; and d) hypnagogic nightmares. We have confirmed Broughton's finding that the night terror, the most severe type of episode, does not occur in sleep but as part of the \"arousal response,\" a complex of autonomic discharge and behavioral symptoms. The full blown night terror is a fight-flight episode combining sleep utterances, sleep walking and hallucinated or delusional mental content associated with terror. There is a significant positive correlation between intensity of night terror and the amount of delta sleep preceding arousal, e.g., stage 4 arousals designated as night terrors are preceded by longer periods of stage 4 than arousals of lesser intensity (p <.05). About two-thirds of both stage 4 and night terrors occurs in the first non-REM (NREM) period. The night terror arises out of physiologically quiescent sleep as indicated by the normal or slightly less them normal cardiorespiratory rates during the first NREM period and absence of skin resistance changes prior to the attack. The night terror is ushered in by sudden loud piercing screams, the subject passing into an aroused state characterized by alpha rhythm, motility, often somnambulism, intense autonomic discharge (precipitous doubling or even tripling of heart rate, great increase in respiratory amplitude, marked decrease in skin resistance), brief duration (1 to 3 minutes), varying degrees of amnesia for the episode, and rapid return to sleep. The night terror is a much more severe phenomenon than the REM nightmare although the latter is far more frequent. The nightmare occurs in REM sleep, is characterized by slight autonomic fluctuations, compared to the night terror, and, in half of instances, a \"desomatization\" of the anxiety response, that is, absence of its physiological concomitants. The REM state is physiologically activated to begin with, constituting a preparation for fright, possibly a buffer against the extreme terror of the stage 4 variety. The important problem of the triggering mechanisms of the night terror remains unsolved: whether the attack is precipitated by ongoing mental content during delta sleep, or represents a psychosomatic \"arousal response\" (Broughton). The fact that it can be induced artificially by sounding a buzzer speaks in favor of the latter, the finding of significant mental content in favor of the former. The night terror is not a dream but a symptom emerging from stage 3-4 sleep, associated with a rift in the ego's capacity to control anxiety.",

When a recording is made of an electroencephalogram (EEG) and other physiological variables such as muscle activity and eye movements during sleep (a technique called polysomnography) a pattern of sleep consisting of five different stages emerges. This pattern varies from person to person, but usually consists of four or five cycles of quiet sleep alternating with paradoxical (active) sleep, with longer periods of paradoxical sleep in the latter half of the night. A representation of these various stages over time is known as a hypnogram, and one of these derived from a normal control subject is shown in Figure 1. The quiet sleep is divided further into four stages, each with a characteristic EEG appearance, with progressive relaxation of the muscles and slower, more regular breathing as the deeper stages are reached. Most sleep in these deeper stages occurs in the first half of the night.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders. So its a demand of time to know about the real sleep and the disturbed sleep according to Ayurveda and Mordern medicines also and effect of Taila Dhara Brahmi,Jatamamsi siddha) in treating Insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome involves recurring episodes of total obstruction (apnea) or partial obstruction (hypopnea) of airways during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome affects mainly obese individuals and it is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index of five or more episodes per hour associated with daytime somnolence. In addition to anatomical factors and neuromuscular and genetic factors, sleep disorders are also involved in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Obesity affects upper airway anatomy because of fat deposition and metabolic activity of adipose tissue. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and metabolic syndrome have several characteristics such as visceral obesity, hypertension and insulin resistance. Inflammatory cytokines might be related to the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome. Sleep apnea treatment includes obesity treatment, use of equipment such as continuous positive airway pressure, drug therapy and surgical procedures in selected patients. Currently, there is no specific drug therapy available with proven efficacy for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Body-weight reduction results in improvement of sleep apnea, and obesity treatment must be emphasized, including lifestyle changes, anti-obesity drugs and bariatric surgery.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a common and disabling condition; its lifetime prevalence in general population is estimated by several studies to 1-5%. There are data that prove the fact that patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits in all stages of the disorder, but also during remission phases. Within bipolar disorder, bipolar depression occurs more frequently, lasts longer and has a higher rate of relapses than mania. Bipolar patients usually complain of cognitive deficits such as attentional or memory deficits Patients with bipolar disorder experiment during depressive episodes dysfunctions in attention (difficulties in focusing and maintaining attention), memory (deficits of declarative and nondeclarative memory, affected verbal recall and recognition), language (bradyphemia with longer moments of pause during speech), psychomotor performance (psychomotor inhibition, slowness of motor functions when the number of tasks increases), executive functions (limited ability to acquire or relearn different skills), general intellectual functioning (information processing deficits). Recent studies have made some suggestion regarding a certain degree of cognitive impairment that is also found in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. In order to have a more accurate assessment regarding the degree of cognitive dysfunctions both during depressive episodes and euthymic phases in bipolar disorder, diagnosis criteria for depression and for remission should be strictly respected and coexisting factors that may influence the results should not be taken in consideration.",

It is estimated that the prevalence of sleep apnea in patients with bipolar disorder can be 21-47.5%. Some symptoms of OSA are the same as the symptoms of depression: daytime drowsiness, cognitive dysfunction, decreased drive, apathy, depressed mood, anhedonia.We present a case of a patient whose depressive symptoms persisted despite repeated changes of pharmacological treatment and were exacerbated by severe sleep disorder. OSA was also the cause of serious respiratory complications and prolonged disorders of consciousness that occurred during ECT treatment.Based on test results of WatchPAT200 and polysomnography, the diagnosis of severe sleep apnea was established and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment was introduced. Severe OSA led in this patient to almost total absence of REM sleep, a significant reduction of deep sleep as well as the reduction of total sleep time.The presence of daytime sleepiness, unremitting despite the modification of treatment, indicates the need for diagnostic screening for OSA, which can mimic some of the symptoms of depression, increase the risk of complications during anesthesia, and can be one of the causes of drug resistance. In addition to the negative impact of obstructive sleep apnea on the course of bipolar disorder, OSA also causes significant cognitive impairment in terms of attention and vigilance, long-term semantic and visual memory as well as visual-spatial and executive functions.",

The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Estimates are that 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness, hindering daily functioning and affecting health.' Psychiatric illness is common among people who have a sleep disorder. The relationship between psychiatric illness and sleep disorders is bidirectional: People with mental illness often have sleep complaints, and a primary sleep disorder often results in neuropsychiatric complications. What is obstructive sleep apnea? The most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by frequent cessations of breathing during sleep because of an obstruction of the upper airway. The obstruction occurs secondary to inadequate motor tone of the tongue or airway dilator muscles, or both) In addition, many people with OSA have central apneic episodes, in which breathing stops temporarily without airway blockage or respiratory [effort.sup.2]. The prevalence of OSA is growing as obesity in the United States increases. Risk factors for OSA include obesity, a craniofacial abnormality, an upper-airway abnormality, heredity, smoking, and nasal congestion. OSA plays a role in causing and exacerbating medical illness in people with severe and persistent mental illness, contributing to a significantly shortened life span. Attending to the general health of people who suffer from severe mental illness--including effective treatment of illnesses such as OSA--is [crucial.sup.3]. Clinical features of OSA OSA is characterized by hypopnea (a decrease in breathing during sleep) or apnea (an actual pause in breathing). Pauses in breathing during sleep of at least 10 seconds, with obstruction of oronasal airflow despite continuous chest and abdominal movements, are referred to as obstructive apneas. These pauses are associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep, or [both.sup.1] Primary features of OSA include sleep fragmentation accompanied by nocturnal hypoxemia and hypercapnia, with resulting excessive daytime sleepiness, mood problems, and poor neurocognitive performance (Table 1). OSA often causes potentially serious organ system dysfunction, including adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects. Studies have suggested that executive dysfunction can be a feature of OSA, which is thought to be related to prefrontal lobe dysfunction caused by intermittent hypoxia. All of these conditions can contribute significantly to decreased quality of [life.sup.1] The prevalence of OSA in the general population is approximately 20% when the condition is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index >5 events an hour. The index is the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes that occur during 1 hour of [leep.sup.4]. OSA and psychiatric illness Psychiatric disorders often are comorbid with OSA. These include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and substance use disorder. Depression. Several studies have documented that OSA and depressive disorder often are comorbid. Many symptoms are common to both, including fatigue, daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, irritability, and weight gain (Figure, page 62), although some core symptoms of depression (eg, sadness, anhedonia, guilt, and agitation) are clearly distinguishable from symptoms of OSA. The current recommendation is that a mood disorder should be considered secondary to OSA, and treated [accordingly.sup.5]. Anxiety. OSA also has been linked to anxiety and nocturnal panic attacks. Frequent awakening due to choking from breathing cessation might play a role in the development of anxiety in patients with OSA, although the association is unproven. Studies have shown a correlation between anxiety disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the core symptoms of [OSA.sup.6] OSA is highly prevalent among combat veterans who have PTSD and complain of being overly vigilant at night; experiencing nightmares and frequent awakening; and having nonrestorative [sleep. …",

Thirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. Seven attacks were reported after waking in the morning or shortly before going to sleep. The beginnings of sleep-related attacks were distributed arbitrarily between different non-REM sleep stages. No association of CH attacks with REM or sleep disordered breathing was observed. Increased heart rate temporally associated with transition from one sleep state to another was observed before patients awoke with headache. Total sleep time, total wake time, arousal index and distribution of non-REM sleep stages were different between chronic and episodic CH.CH attacks are not associated with REM sleep. Brain regions involved in sleep stage transition might be involved in pathophysiology of CH. Differences in sleep characteristics between subgroups might indicate adaptation processes or underlying pathophysiology.",

These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea detection using automatic speech recognition approaches",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a breathing disorder caused by full (apnea) or partial obstruction (hypopnea) of the upper airway during sleep. OSA has nocturnal and diurnal symptoms. Prominent nocturnal symptoms are loud snoring, gasping, choking and breathing difficulties. Diurnal symptoms such as neurocognitive dysfunction, excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, lack of concentration, fatigue and tiredness are caused by sleep fragmentation due to repetitive apnoea events. It is reported that, OSA prevails in 3.1 to 7.5 % of men and in 1.2 to 4.5% of women. At present, over 80% of OSA patients are remained undiagnosed.The reference standard for OSA diagnosis is Polysomnography (PSG). The main outcome of PSG is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). AHI is a coarse description of the upper airway during sleep  that summarises a vast stream of time-varying overnight data drawn from a PSG study into a single-number representation. The number of apnea/hypopnea events in a given one-hour period can vary widely during the night; the overnight average (AHI) is incapable of describing such variations. In describing the dynamic characteristics associated with apnea/hypopnea events and their overnight distributions it may be useful to take these differences in events into account. By capturing these dynamic characteristics, it may be possible to describe the instantaneous behaviour and the temporal dynamics of the upper airway. At present, no non-intrusive or non-contact technology is available for capturing the instantaneous characteristics of the upper airway. Developing such technology can be highly advantageous for the diagnosis and treatments of OSA.We develop a method to model the temporal acoustical characteristics of snoring sounds by considering the dynamic behaviour acoustic characteristics at snore episode level using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient as acoustic features. Assuming differences in the anatomical and physiological upper airway configurations between low-AHI and high-AHI subjects, we defined different snorer groups with respect to AHI thresholds 15 and 30. We also define a measure called Instantaneous Apneaness Score (IAS) in terms of the log-likelihoods produced by respective HMMs. IAS indicates the degree of class membership of each episode to one of the predefined groups as well as the instantaneous OSA severity. We then assigned each patient to an overall AHI band based on the majority vote of each episode of snoring. The proposed method has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity between 87–91%.Previous studies suggest that information critical for OSA disease is dispersed in different frequency sub-bands. We trained both HMM and LRM-based classifiers using those OSA critical for OSA diagnosis. We computed sub-band level acoustic features: MFCCs, Resonants (Formants), Pitch Period and non-Gaussianity Index. A series of low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters for sub-band level feature computation. Also, it is possible that some sub-bands may not contain any relevant information for OSA diagnosis but may act as noise by suppressing the discriminatory power of information in OSA relevant sub-bands. Further, certain sub-bands may carry redundant information which can be excluded from processing without making any impact on diagnostic accuracy. Both these noisy and redundant information may adversely affect the diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms used in OSA diagnosis. We identified sub-bands that can produce higher or equal diagnostic accuracy when compared to that of the full-bandwidth for AHI thresholds 15 and 30. The diagnostic performance of sub-band models was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.We also investigated the impact of audio data compression in snoring-sound-based OSA diagnosis. In that investigation we trained and tested MFCC-based GMM-HMM models using three types of audio data: uncompressed, lossless and lossy audio data formats, namely WAV, FLAC and MP3 respectively. We observed significant data size reduction in FLAC and MP3, 58% and 73% respectively when compared to the size of their uncompressed counterpart, WAV. The diagnostic performance of FLAC was identical to that of WAV while MP3 reported identical accuracy and 5%-8% difference in sensitivity and specificity to that of WAV.",

      "title": "1219 Diagnosing Narcolepsy by MSLT Without Taking in the Full Picture",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy is typically diagnosed by symptoms and an abnormal multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, many factors can affect the results of the MSLT, leading to an overdiagnosis of narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old female was referred with prior diagnoses of narcolepsy, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, polysubstance abuse, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hypertension. The patient obtained the diagnosis of narcolepsy by polysomnography/MSLT through another facility and was prescribed amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated: total sleep time 285 minutes, rapid-eye movement (REM) latency 223 minutes, overall apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 6/h, and REM AHI 45/h. The next day MSLT demonstrated a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes and 2 sleep-onset REM periods on the second and fourth naps. A urine drug screen (UDS) was not obtained. She reported 4-6 hours of sleep/day at the time of her MSLT. She denied cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or sleep-related hallucinations. Conclusion This case is one of many seen at our tertiary referral center of patients presenting with a diagnosis of narcolepsy by MSLT, but the MSLT was performed in invalid conditions. Many medications, substances, insufficient sleep, inappropriate timing of testing, untreated OSA, and other medical conditions all have the potential to lead to an abnormal MSLT that would appear consistent with narcolepsy, but often these factors are not considered. Insufficient sleep at home or on the preceding polysomnogram can lead to an abnormal MSLT. Though our patient had a history of polysubstance abuse, a UDS was not obtained. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine enjoins a polysomnogram for a duration of a 7-hour minimum (with 6 hours of sleep) prior to conducting an MSLT. Our patient only slept for 4.75 hours in the overnight polysomnogram. Her polysomnogram also showed OSA. A combination of these factors likely contributed to the patient’s daytime sleepiness. Her insufficient sleep, OSA, and use of sedating medications/substances should have been addressed first before performing an MSLT. We strongly encourage providers to ensure the MSLT is done in valid conditions to prevent the misdiagnosis of narcolepsy and initiation of unnecessary treatment. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fact: Actually, inadequate or poor-quality sleep can affect you in many different ways, both psychologically and physically. So much is this the case that often this explanation of your difficulties gets overlooked instead of being dealt with. Many people know they do not sleep well, although many do not ask for help and soldier on as best they can. Others are less aware that their sleep is unsatisfactory and that they could benefit if their sleep was improved. Ideally, a person’s sleep at night should be both long enough (adequate sleep) and also of sufficiently good quality to restore them, so that they feel well and can function properly during the day. Good-quality sleep means that sleep is sound and unbroken. In addition, sleep quality can be impaired (also called ‘fragmented’ sleep) by very brief arousals without you consciously waking up. This happens particularly in later life and in various sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (see Chapter 9), causing daytime sleepiness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Six patients between the ages of 17 and 32 years presented with unusual sleep‐walking episodes characterized by screaming or unintelligible vocalizations; complex, often violent automatisms; and ambulation. Two or more attacks could occur in a single night and were most common in the early morning hours. Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months. This syndrome appears to be distinct from more typical non–rapid eye movement dyssomnias and suggests an atypical form of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Given that sleep-wake cycle dysfunction can cause hallucinations in Parkinson’s disease patients, sleep-related hallucinations may be a different subtype from hallucinations that occur only during full wakefulness. However, few studies that distinguish the onset situations of hallucinations related to sleep from those that occur in full wakefulness have been conducted to investigate hallucinations in Parkinson’s disease patients. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter observational study to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with sleep-related hallucinations in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Information on hallucinations was collected by using a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. Of 100 consecutive patients with Parkinson’s disease, 29 (29%) reported sleep-related hallucinations, and 16 (16%) reported hallucinations only in the full wakefulness. A longer duration of Parkinson’s disease treatment (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.72), higher Beck Depression Inventory-II scores (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14), and higher rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder scores (OR 5.60; 95% CI 1.54 to 20.38) were independent factors associated with the presence of sleep-related hallucinations in a multivariable analysis. Sleep-related hallucinations, but not daytime hallucinations, were associated with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Phenomenological discrimination between sleep-related hallucinations and daytime hallucinations is important for elucidating the full pathology in Parkinson’s disease and the mechanisms underlying hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To quickly diagnose migraine without aura in a busy practice clinical in India and other developing countries. Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The most important determinant of the circadian influences of sleep and wakefulness on BP is the nighttime parasympathetic prevalence and daytime sympathetic prevalence including many other physiologic mechanisms known either to induce sleep or determine arousal, may play an important role in the mediation of sleep influences on blood pressure (BP), and this disturbed sleep and high blood pressure is very common in Fibromyalgia Syndrome patients. Each stage of sleep exerts an effect on BP regulating and contributing to its circadian (24-h) rhythm. Alteration of one or more of such mechanisms may be reflected in altered circadian BP rhythms in Fibromyalgia Syndrome. Methods: Sleep and arousal-related mechanisms that is disturbed in FMS patients along with the parameters that effect circadian BP rhythms including neurohumoral sleep factors like melatonin and waking factor like Cortisol was done in 50 FMS patients and equal number of controls. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed in 50 FMS and compared to those of 50 control subjects matched for age, gender and daytime BP. Results: The non-dipping pattern (a less than 10% reduction in nocturnal BP) was more prevalent in FMS than in control subjects (89 versus 64%, P < 0.01). Nighttime BP was higher in FMS than in control subjects (P < 0.01 and < 0.001 for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively). Whereas, the night time levels of melatonin was found to be significantly lower, and that of Cortisol levels were found to be higher during night hours among FMS patients group. Conclusion: An abnormal circadian BP profile is highly prevalent among FMS patients. These changes in the circadian BP rhythm are known to be strongly related to one's risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and extreme severity of FMS symptom.",

The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

      "title": "Clinical and Prognostic Implications of Cognitive Dysfunction and Depression in COPD",
      "abstract": "In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cognitive dysfunction - mainly of secondary memory, executive, and constructional abilities - is a marker of disease severity with important clinical and prognostic implications. It correlates with poor compliance with pharmacological therapy, and poor compliance, in turn, increases the cost/effectiveness ratio of home care programs. Executive dysfunction is associated with difficulty with inhaler devices and should be systematically evaluated before prescribing. Drawing impairment has been associated with mortality, although the underlying neurologic abnormalities (right insular damage with autonomic dysfunction or subcortical damage) remain to be defined. Depression is also negatively correlated with survival, besides being a risk factor for quitting respiratory rehabilitation. Cognitive dysfunction should always be considered among the systemic effects of COPD and be the object of systematic screening in COPD patients. Identifying cognitive impairment would prompt either interventions promoting the adherence to the therapy or further investigations to exclude respiratory (nocturnal or effort hypoxemia, coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea) or non respiratory (decompensated diabetes, hypoglycaemic crises, poorly controlled hypertension etc.) causes of cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive enhancing strategies deserve consideration in the framework of a comprehensive approach aimed at improving the health status of people with COPD.

      "title": "La actividad Alfa frontal en insomnes primarios con dificultad para iniciar el sueño",
      "abstract": "Difficulty in sleep initiation, with or without objective signs, is one of the most frequent complaints in primary insomniacs. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity characteristic of waking (beta and alpha oscillations) is gradually replaced by the EEG signs of sleep (sleep spindles and theta/delta waves) during the sleep onset period (SOP) in normal subjects. The decrease in fast oscillations occurs at the first signs of stage 1, whereas theta and delta increase occurs later, indicating that waking promoting mechanisms are turned off before sleep-promoting mechanisms are fully started. It could be therefore hypothesized that difficulty in sleep initiation in insomniacs might be due to either a hyperactivation of waking promoting systems, a weakness of sleep promoting mechanisms or an imbalance between them. Quantitative EEG analysis has revealed higher beta during wakefulness, as well as during sleep and lower slow (delta) activity in insomniacs. The presence of alpha activity during cognitive information processing, especially of slow alpha activity in relation to attention, as well as in some pathologies associated to sleep disturbances, has suggested that alpha activity during sleep is a sign of activation; however, alpha activity during sleep has been less studied in insomniacs. Only broad bands have been considered in all of the aforementioned studies, and in almost all of them the analyses were restricted to central regions. It is therefore important to study the entire frequency spectrum of EEG activity in insomniacs. Sleep initiation does not occur simultaneously over the entire cortex but starts as a local process which gradually invades the rest of the cortex, in which the frontal lobes play a crucial role. Frontal and parietal regions are part of an important network involved in attention and conduction of thought. Thus, quantitative analysis of narrow EEG bands and their distribution in the cerebral cortex may contribute to a better understanding of neural mechanisms compromised in etiology of sleep initiation in primary insomnia. The main objective of the present investigation was, therefore, to analyze the spectral power of narrow EEG bands in the 19 derivations of the 10-20 International System during SOP in primary insomniacs with difficulty in sleep initiation. Given that one of the main complaints of insomniacs is the difficulty to initiate sleep and that hyperarousal is one of the factors proposed to be involved in the etiology of insomnia, EEG activity during SOP of the first night in the laboratory was analyzed to control activating effects of surrounding circumstances and isolate permanent EEG characteristics. Subjects were 19-34 years old, right-handed with primary sleep insomnia, which were thoroughly screened via structured psychiatric, medical and sleep interviews and scales. Subjects were younger and the age range was narrower than in other EEG frequency spectral content studies of primary insomniacs to avoid confounding effects of changes in sleep architecture or in EEG generated by development. All patients met the criteria for primary insomnia with sleep onset difficulty and impaired daytime function on three or more nights per week for at least six months and with no medical, psychiatric or neurological conditions; they were not medicated and had no other sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "In 3 patients with the syndrome of Unverricht-Lundborg's myoclonus-epilepsy electropolygraphic examinations were carried out during night sleep. A substantial disorganization of the sleep was revealed, the degree of which correlated with the gravity of the clinical picture. This disorganization manifested itself in pronounced changes of the electroencephalographic phenomenology of the sleep and disturbance of its structure with a prolongation of the 1st stage and the delta-sleep and a shortening of the 2nd stage and the quick sleep phase. An insufficient EEG desynchronization was noted in the periods of awakeness, drowsiness, and quick sleep: this pointed to defective functioning of the brain desynchronizing systems. In distinction from other forms of epilepsy the pathological paroxysmal activity was prevalent also in the period of the awakeness, and diminished in parallel with the depth of the sleep. The myoclonic hyperkinesis got also weaker at the stage of slow sleep, but became more intense at the quick sleep stage. The data obtained point to a pronounced dysfunction of the non-specific activating and deactivating systems of the brain in myoclonus-epilepsy. This dysfunction is associated with an organic affection of the trunco-diencephalic structures and the influence of the active epileptic process.",

There is no reason to assume, a priori, that the sleep of an older adult is necessarily problematic; in fact, many high-functioning older adults are satisfied with their sleep. When the various factors that can disrupt sleep—poor health, primary sleep disorders, poor sleep-hygiene practices (e.g., irregular sleep schedules and poor sleeping environments), and so on—are screened out, “optimally” or “successfully” aging older adults, assuming they remain healthy, can expect to experience little further change in their sleep and are not likely to experience excessive daytime sleepiness and the concomitant need to nap regularly during the day. Nevertheless, the majority of older adults, who are not optimally aging, suffer significant sleep disturbances from a variety of causes. Fortunately, our growing understanding of how sleep changes with aging and of the causes of these changes is informing ever-improving treatments for these disturbances, thereby helping to ensure that growing older does not mean sleeping poorly.",

Primary nocturnal enuresis describes those children who have always been wet. Secondary nocturnal enuresis is defined as a relapse after a child has been completely dry for at least six months. Up to the age of nine years, nocturnal enuresis is twice as common in boys than girls but thereafter there is no sex difference in prevalence. At the age of five, 2% of children wet every night, and 1% are still wetting every night in their late teens. Bedwetting is not primarily caused by an underlying psychological disorder However, psychological problems and life events can exacerbate or precipitate bedwetting in susceptible children who have a genetic basis for their condition. The three systems approach to the management of the condition addresses: poor arousal from sleep, nocturnal polyuria and bladder dysfunction. Bedwetting is occasionally caused by underlying medical conditions; primarily urological, neurological, or metabolic. It can also be associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. However, these causes are uncommon in primary enuresis. A basic history and examination should exclude these conditions. If the bedwetting has started in the past few days or weeks, systemic illness should be considered e.g. UTI, diabetes mellitus. With secondary enuresis, symptoms or signs of medical and psychological conditions or life events may be elicited as possible causes, and may need separate treatment. Alarm treatment should be considered in any child over seven. The alarm takes several weeks to be effective and needs commitment from both child and carers. Desmopressin may be used as first-line treatment if rapid onset and/or short-term improvement is the priority of treatment or an alarm is inappropriate or undesirable.",

Some symptoms of diabetes, such as painful peripheral neuropathy and nocturia, or associated other sleep disorders, such as sleep breathing disorders or sleep movement disorders, may influence sleep quality and quantity. Both sleep disorders and diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment. The risk of development of cognitive impairment in diabetic patients may be related to vascular and non-vascular and other factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central insulin resistance, amyloid and tau deposits and other causes. Numerous sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are most likely are also associated with cognitive impairment. Adequate functioning of the system of clearance of the brain from toxic substances, such as amyloid β, i.e. glymphatic system, is related to undisturbed sleep and prevents cognitive impairment.

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "abstract": "Headaches and sleep problems are common complaints in the daily practice of the general practitioner. Since the relationship between headaches and sleep complaints is complex, clear models of interaction are needed for adequate diagnosis and treatment.All subjects, successively seen in a headache clinic during a defined period, were subdivided based on the time of onset of cephalalgia. Subjects who reported onset of headache on a long-term basis, during the nocturnal or early morning (before final awakening) period, were systematically studied by a headache clinic and a sleep disorders center. This subgroup represented 17% of the total headache group.Although the results of the headache clinic study did not differentiate this subgroup from the other patients, the sleep disorders center's interviews and questionnaires demonstrated a significant impact of the sleep disorders on headache and daytime function. Nocturnal monitoring during sleep identified specific sleep disorders in 55% of the subjects with onset of headache during the nocturnal sleep period. Follow-up after treatment of the sleep disorder showed that all subjects with an identifiable sleep disorder reported either an improvement or absence of their headache. The subjects identified with periodic limb movement syndrome were mostly those who reported only an improvement in their sleep and still needed treatment for their headaches. The question of the interaction and association of sleep-related headache and periodic limb movement syndrome is unresolved.Headaches occurring during the night or early morning are often related to a sleep disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Violent behavior during sleep is a common problem, affecting > 2% of the population > 15 years old as found in two large epidemiologic studies. The differential diagnosis of sleep related injury and violence includes: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); NREM sleep parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors); parasomnia overlap disorder (RBD + NREM sleep parasomnias); obstructive sleep apnea; sexsomnia (sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors); sleep related dissociative disorder; trauma-associated sleep disorder/post-traumatic stress disorder; periodic limb movement disorder; rhythmic movement disorder; nocturnal scratching disorder; nocturnal seizures; and miscellaneous/mixed conditions. Careful clinical interviews, preferably with bed partners participating, and extensive, hospital-based, technologist-attended, overnight video-polysomnography (for one or more nights), is crucial for determining the accurate diagnosis that will guide proper therapy. Most of the disorders mentioned above are classified as parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, with parasomnias defined as abnormal behavioral, experiential and/or autonomic nervous system activity during entry into sleep, during any stage of sleep, and during emergence from any stage of sleep. Parasomnias are often manifestations of \"state dissociation\" in which components of one state of being (wake, REM sleep, NREM sleep) intrude into, and become admixed, with other states of being, with clinical consequences. There are forensic implications related to the parasomnias, with inadvertent and unintentional assaults, murder, and \"pseudo-suicide\" resulting from aggressive and violent behaviors arising from sleep with suspended awareness and judgement.",

      "title": "Severe Sleep Deprivation Causes Hallucinations and a Gradual Progression Toward Psychosis With Increasing Time Awake",
      "abstract": "Background: Going without sleep for long periods of time can produce a range of experiences, including perceptual distortions and hallucinations. Many questions, however, remain unanswered regarding the types of symptoms which are most reliably elicited, the time of symptom onset, and whether symptoms worsen over time towards psychotic decompensation. Since sleep deprivation exceeding 48 h is considered unethical today, an examination of historical studies with extreme sleep-loss duration is needed to obtain information about what happens during prolonged sleep loss. Methods: A systematic-review approach was used to identify experimental and observational studies of sleep deprivation in healthy people which describe the effects of prolonged sleep loss on psychopathological symptoms, without any date restriction. Results: A total of 476 articles were identified. Of these, 21 were eligible for inclusion. Duration of sleep loss ranged between 24 h and 11 nights (total 760 participants; average 72-92 h without sleep). All studies except one reported perceptual changes, including visual distortions (i.e., metamorphopsias), illusions, somatosensory changes and, in some cases, frank hallucinations. The visual modality was the most consistently affected (in 90% of the studies), followed by the somatosensory (52%) and auditory (33%) modalities. Symptoms rapidly developed after one night without sleep, progressing in an almost fixed time-dependent way. Perceptual distortions, anxiety, irritability, depersonalisation, and temporal disorientation started within 24-48 h of sleep loss, followed by complex hallucinations and disordered thinking after 48-90 h, and delusions after 72 h, after which time the clinical picture resembled that of acute psychosis or toxic delirium. By the third day without sleep, hallucinations in all three sensory modalities were reported. A period of normal sleep served to resolve psychotic symptoms in many - although not all - cases. Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms develop with increasing time awake, from simple visual/somatosensory misperceptions to hallucinations and delusions, ending in a condition resembling acute psychosis. These experiences are likely to resolve after a period of sleep, although more information is required to identify factors which can contribute to the prevention of persistent symptoms.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

Many respiratory problems during sleep are related to an abnormal control of ventilation. The impaired ventilatory responses permit the development of hypoventilation during sleep and of sleep-related hypoxemia in patients with hypoxic chronic emphysema post TB sequela and kyphoscoliosis. In all these conditions, the hypoxia is most marked in REM sleep, when the ventilatory responses are at their lowest. The impaired ventilatory responses during sleep may accompanied by a decrease in the response of the upper airway opening muscles to chemostimulation during sleep and both factors may be important in the initiation and continuation of apneas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which causes failure of endogenous circadian rhythm cycles to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Despite an unknown prevalence in sighted people, it's thought to be rare. We present a case of a sighted patient with concurrent bipolar disorder who presented with excessive sleepiness since preadolescence, and was later found to have N24SWD. Report of case(s) A 29 year old woman with bipolar disorder presented with excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular sleep schedule since age 12. During her teenage years she often fell asleep at school, and she felt the sleepiness could be associated with psychotropic medication. As she grew up, despite her bipolar disorder was well-controlled, the daytime sleepiness persisted, which caused great challenge concentrating at work and difficulty holding a job. She denies cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or restless legs syndrome symptoms. She had no history of shift work or abnormal movements during sleep. Her bedtime advanced and cycled through a 24-hour period according to sleep diary. Her rise time maintains a consistent interval with her bedtime. Previously she had multiple sleep latency test and polysomnogram, after which she was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. She was treated with several stimulants without much improvement. She was offered CBT-I but hasn’t gone. She failed trial of a standardized schedule and found it stressful. She tried melatonin and light therapy for a short time without much of success, she was subsequently started on tasimelteon and the clinical response is to be followed. Conclusion N24SWD is reportedly rare in the sighted population, with a possible different mechanism from that of the blind population. Behavioral and environmental factors might contribute to the dysynchrony between a normal central circadian pacemaker and a non-24-hour sleep-wake behavioral pattern. Our patient's sleepiness persisted despite her psychiatric disorders were in remission. Altered circadian rhythms are not uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders, and circadian rhythm dysfunction may be a trait marker of bipolar disease. Some antidepressant are also found to cause potential iatrogenic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Psychosocial interventions that target stabilizing daily rhythms in patients with concurrent psychiatric illness can be helpful. Support (if any)",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

The management of the patients is very important. The present study focused on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods and long-term prognosis of this particular syndrome.The clinical data of 39 narcoleptic children were analyzed. Sleep EEG monitoring was performed in all patients. Among the 39 cases, 23 were followed up.All the patients manifested with excessive daytime sleepiness, with disrupted nocturnal sleep occurring in 35 cases. Cataplexy appeared in 36 cases, and sleep paralysis in 9, hypnagogic hallucination in 19, and automatic behavior in 6 cases, respectively. Sleep EEG monitoring demonstrated a short mean sleep latency (< 5 minutes) and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in 38 cases. Twenty-three of the 39 cases were followed-up. Seventeen cases were followed-up for over one year. The longest follow-up duration was 14 years. Methylphenidate was administered in 10 cases. The excessive daytime sleepiness had been improved in 7 cases (70%). No obvious adverse effects were found. Psychosocial and academic problems appeared in most cases.Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder. A definite diagnosis is established when the symptoms of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness occur in association with the characteristic findings on sleep EEG monitoring. Appropriate drug therapy and psychosocial management are of help for such patients. Stimulant medication is an important component of the overall treatment program. A comprehensive approach is necessary to meet the needs of children with narcolepsy. Family education and emotional support are key elements in the management plan. The overall goal for managing childhood narcolepsy is to assist the child and family in achieving optimal quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and epilepsy is bidirectional. While certain types of seizures occur almost exclusively during sleep, sleep deprivation can precipitate seizures and can activate interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). While non-rapid eye movement sleep is an activator of IEDs and seizures, rapid eye movement sleep suppresses them. Nocturnal seizures need to be distinguished from parasomnias. Epileptic seizures and IEDs result in changes of sleep architecture, while antiepileptic drugs have variable effect on sleep and wakefulness. Nearly one-third of patients with epilepsy complain day time somnolence. In addition to nocturnal seizures and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), associated sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea and restless leg syndromes might be responsible for daytime sleepiness in persons with epilepsy.",

The prevalence of sleep apnea headache is 10–15% in people with OSA, whereas morning headache occurs in 5%. The severity of OSA only slightly affects the prevalence of sleep apnea headache. The pathophysiology of sleep apnea headache remains an enigma, since average oxygen desaturation and lowest oxygen saturation are similar in OSA people without sleep apnea headache.

This approach should assume the form and content of an expert specialist opinion, that is, of a legal medical expertise and should rely on a more extensive medical and non-medical documentation than the one serving for therapeutic purposes. As such methodological approach is rarely met in practice, we have proposed a model that includes evaluation of cumulative exposure to asbestos dust, determination of work and vital disability, and evaluation of mental pain. This method stems from our long-time practice and experience with patients suffering from asbestos-related diseases, including the experience acquired since 2002 from cooperation with the Reference Centre for Asbestosis and Other Asbestos-Related Diseases of the Croatian Ministry of Health at the Department for Pulmonary Diseases of the Clinical Hospital Split.",

They showed electroencephalographically SWC patterns either in clinical or subclinical ways.2) The type of the occurrence of the SWC in the waking state was divided into the following 3 types.Type I: Its occurrence closely related with the patient's arousal level, and was influenced by external circumstances. In other words, the SWC appearred to be occurred in the relaxation or the state of sleepy tendency of the patient, and its occurrence was often interrupted by the stimuli from the outside.Type II: The SWC patterns occurred rhythmically at a certain intervals, and sometimes concentrated at a certain time of the day. In this type, the occurrence was seemed to be ocrrelated with the daily rhythms of the living body.Type III: No characteristics were seemed in the occurrence of the SWC patterns, in addition its frequency was very high and irregular.Type I mainly correlated with petit mal epilepsy, Type II mainly grand malepilepsy, and Type III patients in whom were seemed the sign of severe organic lesions of the brain.Type II patients had 1-2 peaks of the SWC's occurrence in the morning (within 2-3 hours after awake) or in the evening.And so metimes immediately after this peak, clinical grand mal seizures were observed.3) During the sleep the SWC patterns transformed itself, as reported on petit mal epilepsies by many investigators.The SWC patterns which showed regular rhythmicity in the waking state brake out its regular rhythmicity and shortened its duration and, moreover, its slow component dissapeared and showed only spike components according to the depth of sleep.In a whole night this cyclic change of the SWC patterns was repeated.In the stage of activated sleep the SWC patterns dissapeared, or showed the regular rhythmicity and duration as seen in the day time.Comparing the frequency of the SWC's occurrence during the sleep and the day time, the former was more frequent than the latter.Thus, petit mal and grand mal epilepsy which showed different occurrence of the SWC patterns each other in the waking state showed only this occurrence during the sleeping state4) In 5 cases re-recording were done after 6-21 months.The type of the occurrence of the SWC patterns i n the day time showed no changes if the type of the clinical seizure did not changeThis fact emphasized the correlation between the type of the SWC's occurrence in the day time and the type of clinical seizures5) From the findings mentioned above the neurophysiolosical mechanism related to the centrencephalic seizures was discussed.",

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

Apnea is defined as the cessation of breathing for at least 10 seconds during sleep, while hypopnoea is defined as at least 30% reduction in airflow for 10 seconds associated with oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. The presence in the general population is about 4%. The principal symptoms are: excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), snoring, dry throat, morning headache, night sweats, gastro-esophageal reflux, and increased blood pressure.Long term complications can be: increased cardio-cerebrovascular risk and cognitive impairment such as deficiency in attention, vigilance, visual abilities, thought, speech, perception and short term memory.Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is currently the best non-invasive therapy for OSAS.CPAP guarantees the opening of upper airways using pulmonary reflexive mechanisms increasing lung volume during exhalation and resistance reduction, decreasing electromyografical muscular activity around airways.The causes of cognitive impairments and their possible reversibility after CPAP treatment have been analysed in numerous studies. The findings, albeit controversial, show that memory, attention and executive functions are the most compromised cognitive functions.The necessity of increasing the patient compliance with ventilotherapy is evident, in order to prevent cognitive deterioration and, when possible, rehabilitate the compromised functions, a difficult task for executive functions.",

      "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and cognitive impairment: effects of CPAP",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep disorder characterised by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction (apnea) or reduced airflow (hypopnoea) despite persistent respiratory effort. Apnea is defined as the cessation of breathing for at least 10 seconds during sleep, while hypopnoea is defined as at least 30% reduction in airflow for 10 seconds associated with oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. The presence in the general population is about 4%. The principal symptoms are: excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), snoring, dry throat, morning headache, night sweats, gastro-esophageal reflux, and increased blood pressure.Long term complications can be: increased cardio-cerebrovascular risk and cognitive impairment such as deficiency in attention, vigilance, visual abilities, thought, speech, perception and short term memory.Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is currently the best non-invasive therapy for OSAS.CPAP guarantees the opening of upper airways using pulmonary reflexive mechanisms increasing lung volume during exhalation and resistance reduction, decreasing electromyografical muscular activity around airways.The causes of cognitive impairments and their possible reversibility after CPAP treatment have been analysed in numerous studies. The findings, albeit controversial, show that memory, attention and executive functions are the most compromised cognitive functions.The necessity of increasing the patient compliance with ventilotherapy is evident, in order to prevent cognitive deterioration and, when possible, rehabilitate the compromised functions, a difficult task for executive functions.",

      "title": "Obesity and sleep disturbances: Meaningful sub-typing of obesity",
      "abstract": "Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and self-reported short sleep duration appear to be on the rise, while there is evidence that obesity and these sleep disorders are strongly connected. In this paper, we review data that challenge the common belief that the sleep apnoea and sleep loss, frequently associated with obesity, are the primary determinants of obesity-related objective daytime sleepiness and subjective fatigue (tiredness without increased sleep propensity). Specifically, obesity is associated with objective and subjective EDS regardless of the presence of sleep apnoea. The association between obesity and EDS was confirmed in recent studies of large random samples of the general population or clinical samples, which showed that the primary determinants of subjective EDS were depression, metabolic disturbances, i.e. obesity/diabetes and insulin resistance, and lack of physical activity, and, secondarily, sleep apnoea or sleep loss. Paradoxically, within the obese, with or without sleep apnoea, those who slept objectively better at night are sleepier (objectively) during the day than those who slept worse. The distinguishing factor between those that slept better vs. those that slept worse appears to be level of emotional stress. Furthermore, many studies reported that obesity is associated with self-reported short sleep duration; however, it appears that short sleep duration is a marker of emotional stress rather than a reflection of true sleep loss. Based on these data, we propose that obesity-related deeper sleep and objective EDS are primarily related to metabolic disturbances, whereas obesity-related poorer sleep and subjective fatigue appear to be the result of psychological distress. Furthermore, based on data from studies in normal controls and patients with sleep disorders, it appears that the interaction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the level of sleep/arousal within the 24-hour cycle, i.e. \"eucortisolemia\" or \"hypocortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with high sleep efficiency and objective sleepiness, whereas \"hypercortisolemia\" plus hypercytokinemia is associated with low sleep efficiency and fatigue. In conclusion, we propose that the above-reviewed data provide the basis for a meaningful phenotypic and pathophysiologic sub-typing of obesity. One subtype is associated with emotional distress, poor sleep, fatigue, HPA axis \"hyperactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia while the other is associated with non-distress, better sleep but more sleepiness, HPA axis \"normo or hypoactivity,\" and hypercytokinemia. This proposed sub-typing may lead to novel, preventive and therapeutic strategies for obesity and its associated sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "La douleur est une cause majeure de l'insomnie chez les malades et plus de 70% des patients en douleur se plaignent de troubles du sommeil. Des études polysomnographiques ont démontré que les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique affichent une perturbation marquée de la structure et de la continuité du sommeil. Les constatations les plus courantes sont: changements fréquents de phases de sommeil, augmentation des réveils nocturnes, diminution du sommeil à ondes lentes et du sommeil à mouvements oculaires rapides, augmentation du sommeil superficiel et des mouvements du corps, intrusion électroencéphalographique (EEG) de sommeil alpha-delta, augmentation du nombre d'éveils et du taux de pattern d'activation cyclique (PAC). Le PAC est un marqueur physiologique du sommeil instable qui amplifie les réactions aux événements perturbateurs de la consolidation du sommeil. Ainsi, la qualité du sommeil dépend de mécanismes cérébraux qui évaluent les événements externes afin de protéger l'intégrité vitale. Ces mécanismes, situés au niveau thalamique, commande le maintien du sommeil, l'éveil bref ou le réveil comportemental, selon le risque que représente l'événement en cause. Pendant le sommeil, le système neurovégétatif demeure réceptif aux stimuli externes et opère en synchronie avec le processus PAC. Chez les sujets sains, la stimulation thermique nociceptive provoque une accélération du rythme cardiaque peu importe la phase du sommeil, avec un gradient décroissant de la phase 2 au sommeil à ondes lentes et au sommeil MOR. Les réponses autonomiques peuvent varier chez les patients fibromyalgiques n'affichant pas la diminution normale de l'activité sympathique pendant le sommeil et chez les patients éprouvant de la douleur chronique qui sont déjà aux prises avec la fragmentation du sommeil ou l'insomnie. Les modifications spécifiques du sommeil découlant d'un syndrome unique de douleur ou de parasomnies associées à la douleur pendant le sommeil (par ex. le bruxisme, les crampes nocturnes dans les jambes et le reflux gastro-œsophagien) sont également décrites.",

      "title": "Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders and Cardiac Arrhythmia",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of conditions characterized by abnormalities in the frequency and/or depth of breathing during sleep. Cessations in breathing rhythm (apneas) are momentary and often cyclical, while reductions in breath amplitude (hypopneas) may be momentary or sustained (Dempsey et al., 2010). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, central sleep apnea (CSA), upper airway resistance syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are the primary sleep-related respiratory disorders. Although CSA is accompanied by alterations in neural input, the obstruction characteristic of OSA, the most common form of SDB, is also neurally mediated (Veasey, 2009). Intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep characteristic of OSA result from collapse of the upper airway. The concomitant disruption of normal ventilation and sleep architecture is typically associated with snoring, repeated arousals from sleep, and daytime sleepiness (Bradley & Floras, 2003; Lattimore et al, 2003; Quan & Gersh, 2004; Shamsuzzaman et al; 2003;). Prevalence studies indicate that SDB, and particularly OSA, are common problems worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. However, OSA is also considered to be largely undiagnosed (Young et al, 1993; Young et al, 2002; Lavie, 2007). In the United States, for example, the estimated proportions of adults with OSA who are not diagnosed range from 60% to 80%, with an even greater under diagnosis suspected for children (Carter III, 2008). The increasing prevalence can be intuitively associated with the global obesity epidemic; however, a reverse association has also been postulated based on emerging evidence that OSA promotes weight gain (Carter III, 2008). The clinical relevance of OSA was thought for years to be limited to what was considered a benign but often annoying manifestation as snoring, ranging to the possibly serious consequences of daytime sleepiness affecting cognitive function and work performance, mental state, and driving ability. OSA is now known to be a risk factor for other serious conditions, and has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Bradley & Floras, 2009; Devulapally et al., 2009; Lattimore et al, 2003; Lopez-Jiminez et al., 2008). Cardiac arrhythmias are common in OSA, and the potential link between tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias and adverse outcomes in OSA patients continues to be an important area of research (Chan & Wilcox, 2010; Verrier & Josephson, 2009). However, the complex cascade of events triggered by OSA, the difficulty in determining",

      "abstract": "Chronic hypoventilation affects patients with disorders on any level of the respiratory system. The generation of respiratory impulses can be impaired in congenital disorders, such as central congenital alveolar hypoventilation, in alterations of the brain stem or complex diseases like obesity hypoventilation. The translation of the impulses via spinal cord and nerves to the respiratory muscles can be impaired in neurological diseases. Thoraco-skeletal or muscular diseases may inhibit the execution of the impulses. All hypoventilation disorders are characterized by a reduction of the minute ventilation with an increase of daytime hypercapnia. As sleep reduces minute ventilation substantially in healthy persons and much more pronounced in patients with underlying thoraco-pulmonary diseases, hypoventilation manifests firstly during sleep. Therefore, sleep related hypoventilation may be an early stage of chronic hypoventilation disorders. After treatment of any prevailing underlying disease, symptomatic therapy with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is required. The adaptation of the treatment should be performed under close medical supervision. Pressure support algorithms have become most frequently used. The most recent devices automatically apply pressure support and vary inspiratory and expiratory pressures and breathing frequency in order to stabilize upper airways, normalize ventilation, achieve best synchronicity between patient and device and aim at optimizing patients' adherence.",

      "title": "The enigma of severe obstructive sleep apnea without sleepiness",
      "abstract": "It is common for a physician to feel astonished in front of a severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patient who does not complain about sleepiness despite his polysomnography showing hundreds of apneas and hypopneas, oxygen desaturations, and arousals fragmenting sleep all night long. How can such a patient not be sleepy during the day? Part of the problem may be related to the methods used to measure sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score1 is a worldwide used questionnaire that asks to subjectively rate the propensity to fall asleep in specific daytime situations such as while reading, as a passenger in a car, or watching TV. The ESS correlates moderately well with objective measures of sleepiness such as the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and correlates weakly with measures of OSA severity such as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or oxygen saturation.2 Notably, objective measurements of sleepiness do not correlate much better with the AHI or other polysomnographic indices than does the ESS.3, 4 According to a meta-analysis that examined the psychometric properties of the ESS,2 the questionnaire is considered reliable for assessing subjective sleepiness and has a relatively high internal consistency, suggesting that it is appropriate to use for comparisons between groups. Moreover, the ESS is widely available and can be performed more easily and quickly compared to the time-consuming and expensive objective measures of sleepiness. Although the ESS score tends to increase with the severity of OSA, according to the Sleep Health Heart Study, only 46% percent of subjects with moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing reported an abnormal daytime sleepiness (ESS score > 10).5 It is clear from these data that the ESS should not be used during patients screening for OSA as it lacks sensitivity or specificity for this; nonetheless, it is important to assess sleepiness to better understand the patients, in order to better characterize them and to make more informed therapeutic choices, as is has been shown that the presence of sleepiness can affect treatment adherence and outcomes.6 A second problem may be the definition of sleep apnea severity. In patients with OSA, the main factors that have been considered responsible for daytime sleepiness are the frequency of apneas and hypopneas (AHI), the degree of overnight oxygen desaturation, and the degree of sleep fragmentation as assessed by frequency of arousals from sleep and sleep architecture.4 In the clinical setting, only the AHI is used as the single parameter characterizing OSA severity, although it provides a simple count of obstructive episodes per hour of sleep, regardless of the duration and the depth of the ventilatory disturbance or blood gas changes. Thus, the reason for the mild or absent association between sleepiness symptoms and OSA severity may be related to the poor stratification of patients that relies only on the AHI. Indices like the newly introduced hypoxic burden that quantifies the ventilatory disturbance related to OSA may be more helpful in this regard.7 The dissociation between sleepiness and OSA severity has been reported in several observational studies, with a particular emphasis on older people8 and on people with cardiovascular diseases.9 Regarding the latter group, it has been shown that only a minority of individuals with cardiovascular diseases and OSA complains of excessive daytime sleepiness. Arzt et al10 compared subjective daytime sleepiness assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores among 155 patients with HF and a community sample of 1,139 subjects without HF in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. The HF population had lower ESS scores for any degree of OSA severity, despite sleeping approximately 80 minutes less. Similar findings have been shown in patients with atrial fibrillation 11 and stroke.9 In the paper from Tam et al12 published in this issue of The Journal of Clinical Hypertension, the authors found that in an Asian cohort of 280 patients, after adjusting for anthropometric variables, age, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the patients with concomitant hypertension and moderate-to-severe OSA had an ESS score 3.7 points lower compared to normotensive subjects with OSA alone. The study suffers from some limitations, for example the relatively small sample size and the fact that the diagnosis of OSA was obtained with 2 different methods (either a complete in-lab polysomnography or a home cardio-respiratory monitoring) using different scoring criteria for the two systems. The diagnosis of hypertension and other diseases were extracted from the hospital database, and there is a lack of details regarding the hypertensive condition, for example how many of these patients had well-controlled vs drug-resistant hypertension. Nevertheless, the analysis is comprehensive of several confounding factors and the results of this retrospective study are consistent with a previous report 13 suggesting that patients with hypertension and moderate-to-severe OSA on average are less sleepy compared to OSA patients without hypertension. Cross-sectional studies consistently found an increased prevalence of hypertension in patients with OSA and, on the other hand, moderate or severe OSA can be detected in a third of patients with primary hypertension and in up to 80% of those with drug-resistant hypertension.14 OSA patients are frequently “non-dippers,” meaning that they generally do not experience the physiologic reduction in blood pressure that happens overnight during sleep. Although the suppression of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately reduces nocturnal blood pressure, it is still debated if treating OSA can consistently improve blood pressure in a clinically significant way, as the CPAP showed only modest reduction in recent meta-analysis.14 As suggested by Tam and coworkers, one possible explanation for the lack of sleepiness in patients with OSA and cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, is that both disorders may contribute to the increase in central adrenergic alerting mechanisms: the sympathetic autonomic over-activation may be responsible for a hyperaroused state15, 16 that may mask the sleep-inducing effects of OSA. Daytime sleepiness commonly brings patients to medical attention and it is generally the principal clinical indication to treat OSA; its absence has important implications. Most patients with OSA and cardiovascular diseases do not report excessive daytime sleepiness, and thus, the majority of the patients lack this usual indication for treatment, and it remains uncertain whether OSA patients who do not report excessive daytime sleepiness require therapy at all.9, 14 In summary, studies like this by Tam and coworkers highlight some important gaps in the knowledge of OSA and its symptoms: we possibly need a better way to measure sleepiness in the clinical context, surely a better definition of OSA severity and a better understanding of the mechanisms that link sleepiness (or lack of thereof) and cardiovascular diseases in OSA patients.

Assessment should: ... Normal sleep variations and younger children Around 1/4 of 1-year-olds will still be night-waking several times per week and many will still be waking occasionally at 5 years. Breast-fed children wake more. The point at which night-waking becomes a problem may be to some extent dependent on parental attitude and tolerance. Parasomnias Parasomnias are defined as an intrusion into sleep without a reduction in sleep length. In the preschool age group these will usually be night terrors or variants of somnambulism (sleepwalking). The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning. Night terrors usually occur in the first few hours after going to bed [a non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia]",

      "abstract": "Registered interictal epileptiform discharges in adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with variable phenotype (261 people) during standard functional tests (hyperventilation and intermittent photic stimulation) before falling asleep, after awakening and during non-REM sleep. When detecting interictal epileptiform discharges during non-REM sleep, patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy were more likely to have interictal epileptiform discharges recorded during photostimulation and hyperventilation in both periods (after awakening and before falling asleep), which may be due to the pathophysiological features of this subtype of the idiopathic generalized epilepsy with a variable phenotype. When detecting interictal epileptiform discharges during nonREM sleep, patients with juvenile absence epilepsy with absences and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were more likely to have interictal epileptiform discharges recorded during hyperventilation in both periods (after awakening and before falling asleep). In patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with isolated generalized tonic-clonic seizures the relationship between the recording of interictal epileptiform discharges in non-REM sleep and during functional tests was not detected. The obtained data demonstrate the features of interictal epileptiform discharges distribution in sleep and wake periods with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with a variable phenotype in adults and can be used in the extended Electroencephalography monitoring to refine the idiopathic generalized epilepsy subtype and evaluate the effectiveness of antiepileptic therapy.",

Bhutavidya deals with the diseases (psychiatric or neuropsychiatric) caused by \"bhuta\" or \"graha\" (idiopathic factors) and their management. Unmada (broad term which includes various psychiatric conditions) is a disease characterized by deranged mental functions. \"Bhutonmada\" (psychiatric conditions caused by idiopathic factors) is a type of unmada caused by affliction of \"bhuta\" or \"graha.\" Eighteen types of bhutonmada are explained in samhita's (ancient Ayurvedic texts). Previous works have explored these 18 grahonmadas and compared them with various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions. Vishesha or Upa grahonmadas are the subtypes of these 18 grahonmadas, and their description is found only in \"Ashtanga sangraha\" (Ayurvedic textbook of medicine written by Vriddha Vagbhata). Description of 16 \"Vishesha\" or \"Upa grahonmadas\" is available in \"Ashtanga sangraha.\" Till date, no studies have been conducted on Vishesha grahonmadas, and the present study aims at exploring Vishesha grahonmadas with contemporary psychiatric conditions. Ayurvedic literature related to \"Vishesha grahonmadas\" has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and from their commentaries. Electronic databases \"Google\" and \"Google Scholar\" have been searched to find out the relevant studies using appropriate keywords. Sixteen Vishesha grahonmadas explained in Ashtanga sangraha have shown resemblance with various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions such as mood disorders, schizophrenia, frontotemporal dementia, Tourette's syndrome, extra pyramidal movement disorders, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, personality disorders, Parkinson's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The contemporary perspective of ancient psychiatric concepts as demonstrated in the present article provides new insights and paves way further studies.",

      "abstract": "The development of respiratory failure is common in patients with neuromuscular disorders that involve the respiratory muscles. However, the high incidence of sleep-related breathing problems in this population is less well known. In patients with neuromuscular disease, nocturnal breathing abnormalities frequently precede respiratory failure during wakefulness by months or even years. These nocturnal breathing problems are caused by multiple factors, including diaphragm and upper airway muscle weakness, scoliosis, obesity, and central respiratory control problems. Advances in the understanding of the links between sleep-disordered breathing and the development of daytime dysfunction and respiratory failure has revolutionized the management of these individuals. Mask positive pressure therapy is now available to improve both quality of life and longevity for these individuals. The lack of correlation between daytime testing and the severity of nocturnal breathing abnormalities makes it difficult to predict the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Further, patients may not always be aware of symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing, even if specifically questioned. However, simple bedside measurements of vital capacity and inspiratory muscle strength can provide useful guides for when nocturnal respiratory monitoring is indicated.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and headache are two realities known to be linked in a bidirectional way [01]. Clinical research correlates specific headache diagnoses and sleep disorders with chronobiologic patterns and sleep processes, implicating that common anatomic structures and neurochemical processes are involved in the regulation of both sleep and headache. Sleep and pain perception share several structures, such as the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and a number of mesencephalic, pontine and bulbar nuclei, some of which are also involved in breathing regulation. The respiratory parameters during sleep at night may play a important role in modifying susceptibility to various pathological conditions, including headache. Morning headache was found to be more frequent among Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients with a direct relationship with the severity of the sleep breathing disorder: apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) has been found higher in OSAS patients with morning headache compared with those without morning headaches and also mean oxygen saturation value (SpO2) during total sleep time has been found significantly lower in OSAS patients with morning headache [02]. Furthermore, it has been observed that morning headache may be largely resolved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. The relevance of respiratory disturbances during sleep in subjects with primary headaches has not been clearly evaluated. Additionally, in a previous study we found that subjects with headache, and particularly those with headache-related cutaneous allodynia, had alterations in sleep behaviour [03]. Consequently, a possible link between sleep behavior disturbances, respiratory disorders during sleep and primary headaches may be hypothesized.",

Four individuals were interviewed, their dreams collected, and a total of 11 nights of sleep recorded. Although not apparent from initial interviews, all four individuals had more than one specific typical dream. All typical dreams were painful in feeling tone and intrusive. A typical dream may occur in varied motivational contexts, at times simply in association with a somatic sensation. Three individuals had abnormal wave forms in their all-night electroencephalograms.

Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

Intermittent hypoxia leads to sympathetic nervous system activation and oxidative stress with a resultant systemic inflammatory cascade.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) occurs when rapid eye movement (REM)-based atonia intrudes into wakefulness, outside the context of narcolepsy, substance abuse, mental disorder or other medical conditions. No “gold standard” assessment and diagnostic instrument currently exists. Report of Case A 63-year old female with hypersomnia and positive airway pressure (PAP)-controlled obstructive sleep apnea was referred for recurrent episodes of paralysis during sleep-wake transitions, lasting 15-20 seconds, occurring every 2-3 years since the age of 15, and associated with fear and anxiety. Episodes were more frequent in the last 2 years after significant sleep deprivation and starting a weight loss supplement, BIO-X4, which contains green tea and probiotics. No cataplexy, or history of traumatic brain injury and stroke were identified. Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 14 on armodafinil. Reported sleep amounts were regularly scheduled 6-7-hour periods, with no suggestion of circadian dysfunction. In 2016, polysomnogram showed Apnea-Hypopnea index of 2.6/hour, Respiratory Disturbance Index of 13.8/hour with oxygen nadir of 92% in the setting of hypersomnia. Continuous PAP of 11 cmH20 was initiated after a successful titration with controlled residual AHI during follow-ups. Multiple Sleep Latency Test during the same time revealed mean sleep latency of 5.5 minutes and no sleep-onset REM with 5 naps. Brain imaging and electroencephalogram were both normal as well as drug panel, blood counts, metabolic profile and thyroid function. Decreased episodes and severity of recurrent ISP were reported after discontinuation of the supplement. Apart from anxiety related to the episodes, the patient denied any interference with daytime function. Conclusion Isolated sleep paralysis is an important sleep disorder that requires proper evaluation to rule out competing diagnoses and consideration of therapeutic interventions. Likely associated with a lack of understanding and available literature, the prevalence in the general population is likely higher than what is currently perceived.",

Patients with epilepsy often complain of poor sleep and on the other hand, poor sleep makes epilepsy control difficult. Objectives We aimed at comparing the sleep disturbances in a group of patients with medically controlled epilepsy versus another group with medically refractory epilepsy, from the electrophysiological standpoint. Subjects and methods Sixty epilepsy patients were included; half of them with controlled epilepsy were assigned as group I, and the other half with refractory epilepsy was assigned as group II. All patients had an overnight polysomnogram and sleep EEG done. We excluded any patient with abnormal general or neurological clinical examination. Results Patients in group II, had significantly delayed sleep onset latency and REM latency. However, higher arousal index, insomnia, and periodic limb movement index were found to be significantly higher in group I. Respiratory events; as light sleep durations, were observed to be higher in Group II, in addition to apnea-hypopnea index that was significantly higher in this group. Conclusion Epilepsy affects sleep architecture and sleep-related events. Patients with refractory epilepsy suffer from more disturbance in sleep patterns. Moreover, antiepileptic drugs can have a diverse effect on sleep architecture and quality in epileptic patients.",

Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

There is no close correlation between the degree of peripheral muscle weakness and the weakness of the respiratory muscles. Early in the disease the maximum in- and expiratory pressures can be abnormal even though the results of spirometry are normal. Progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles results in a decrease in vital capacity and eventually in alveolar hypoventilation, especially during sleep. General muscle weakness and fatigue may be the reasons why sleep hypoventilation is often overlooked in its early stages. Dyspnea may be a early symptom but it is not unusual that alveolar hypoventilation remains undetected until complications ensue (Cor pulmonale, polycythemia, altered alertness).",

This lead to restless, disrupted sleep, which can cause headaches in the morning and exhaustion in the afternoon. Obstructive sleep apnea affects people of all ages, however it is more common among persons over the age of 60. As a result, the correct diagnosis is essential for effective treatment.

L'organisation temporelle semble traduire, elle, une lutte entre tendance au sommeil lent et tendance au sommeil paradoxal. Le sommeil des mêmes sujets s'est pratiquement normalisé pendant et surtout après le decalage des horaires de sommeil, exceptée la persistance de la réduction importante de la latence du sommeil paradoxal. Il serait ainsi possible d'associer la dépression à une désynchronisation entre rythmicités contrôlant sommeil lent, sommeil paradoxal et d'autres rythmes circadiens. Une resynchronisation forcée par décalage des horaires de sommeil pourrait alors rendre compte des améliorations cliniques et biologiques qui ont été observées.",

      "title": "1147 Sleep Enigmas in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: An Atypical Case of Sleep Movement Disorders and Alpha-Delta Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep disorders are characterized by the impairment of the quality, timing, and amount of sleep, which results in daytime distress and functioning. Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic condition with oto-sino-pulmonary complications associated with various comorbidities, including sleep-related disorders. However, sleep-related research and its implications in PCD are substantially limited. Report of case(s) A 40-year-old Puerto Rican female with a history of RSPH4A [c.921 + 3_921 + 6delAAGT] PCD founder mutation was evaluated for sleeping difficulties. Upon taking history, the patient mentioned that she has been struggling with getting adequate sleep, where she complains of difficulty falling asleep, occasional snoring, and unexplained movements while sleeping. Physical examination presented with Mallampati (4+) but did not show significant neck circumference enlargement, body-mass index, or other neurologic deficits. Diagnostic polysomnogram did not show obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with a baseline Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of 1.3/hr. The patient had a prolonged wake after sleep onset (WASO) period, resulting in poor sleep efficiency. The EEG showed alpha delta sleep. Moreover, Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep (PLMS) were present with important sleep fragmentation during the first half of the study (Periodic Limb Movement Index of 15.9/hr); eventually improving when the patient was able to consolidate sleep. Other movements during sleep/drowsiness were appreciated, with large amplitude and rhythmic artifacts in the EEG and legs EMG channels. These movements are most consistent with Rhythmic Movement Disorder, more notoriously in the lower extremities. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is a unique documented PCD case with the presence of Alpha-Delta Sleep, presenting PLMS, and Rhythmic Movement Disorder. Comprehensive screening protocols, neuropsychiatric evaluation, and additional sleep studies should be considered to evaluate these complexities in patients with PCD. Further studies are required to identify whether these sleep-related disorders are due to neurophysiologic manifestations as seen with Alpha-Delta Sleep, a neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative process associated with this ciliopathy. Multicentric clinical trials are essential for this type of ciliopathy, especially among Puerto Rican and Hispanic populations. Support (if any)",

Breathing as an automatically regulated task consists of different basic anatomic and physiological parts. As the human body goes through the different stages of sleep, physiological changes in the breathing mechanism are present. Sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, are often associated with sleep-disordered breathing and sleep deprivation. Hypoxia and hypercapnia coexist with lack of sleep and undermine multiple functions of the body (e.g., cardiovascular system, cognition, immunity). Among the general population, athletes suffer from these consequences more during their performance. This concept supports the beneficial restorative effects of a good sleeping pattern.",

      "title": "Desafios no diagnóstico das síndromes disautonômicas na gestação: relato de caso",
      "abstract": "Introdução: A gestação é um período singular, no qual alterações fisiológicas podem exacerbar os sintomas das síndromes disautonômicas. A síndrome de taquicardia postural ortostática (POTS) é uma disautonomia simpática caracterizada pelo aumento de ≥30 batimentos por minuto (bpm) na frequência cardíaca quando em posição ortostática, sem hipotensão, que pode estar associada a cefaleia, vertigem, ansiedade, turvação visual e síncope em pacientes acima de 19 anos. Os sintomas de taquicardia no paciente com a síndrome de POTS podem ser desencadeados por: hipovolemia, quando a diminuição da pré-carga provoca a taquicardia reflexa; disfunção neuroendócrina com estado hiperadrenérgico; e disautonomia do sistema nervoso adrenérgico. Por outro lado, a síncope vasovagal vasoplégica ocorre em consequência de uma hipotensão por bradicardia associada ou não a vasodilatação periférica. Relato de caso: Gestante, 20 anos, primigesta, 33 semanas, com história de transtorno depressivo recorrente, com tentativas de suicídio impulsivas e síncope quando em posição ortostática por mais de 10 min. Ao exame físico, apresenta frequência cardíaca de 108 bpm quando sentada; 118 bpm e tontura leve quando em pé por 3 min; 138 bpm e turvação visual quando em pé por 7 min; e 140 bpm, com piora dos sintomas, quando em pé por 10 min. O tilt test realizado foi tecnicamente limitado, pois descreveu aumento na frequência cardíaca e posterior queda da pressão arterial, evoluindo para uma pressão arterial inaudível, e considerou síncope vasovagal vasoplégica positiva, porém não computou o aumento da frequência cardíaca nos primeiros 3 min, critério para a síndrome de POTS. Diante dos achados clínicos e após a interpretação cuidadosa do tilt test, foi aventada a hipótese de síndrome de POTS associada à síncope vasovagal, além de depressão e ansiedade secundárias. Iniciou-se o tratamento com Fluoxetina; ingestão de 3 a 4 litros de água por dia; e uso de meia compressiva, com melhora na tolerância da posição ortostática. Entrou em trabalho de parto com 38 semanas e 6 dias, quando foi indicada a cesariana por desproporção cefalopélvica. O parto e o pós-parto evoluíram sem qualquer intercorrência. Conclusão: Perante os sintomas de disautonomia, os diagnósticos diferenciais devem ser cuidadosamente avaliados. A síndrome de POTS ou a síncope vasovagal vasoplégica não são contraindicações para a gestação. Durante o terceiro trimestre, a pressão uterina na veia cava inferior piora a pré-carga cardíaca, podendo piorar os sintomas de disautonomia. O diagnóstico adequado, associado ao acompanhamento especializado, possibilitam o controle dos sintomas e uma gestação mais segura.",

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

      "title": "Arousal in Nocturnal Consciousness: How Dream- and Sleep-Experiences May Inform Us of Poor Sleep Quality, Stress, and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

We describe a 55-year-old man with frequent brief and sudden sleep-like attacks in combination with nocturnal sleep disturbance. During attacks he was unresponsive, snoring but maintained posture. He resisted passive eye opening but with rolling eyes. The patient was confused on waking. In the interictal period, there were FND signs including give-way weakness of the left hand, typical functional “leg-dragging” gait, mistake in the finger-to-nose test. Video-electroencephalogram monitoring did not detect specific epileptic activity or sleep pattern during the attacks. Polysomnography showed multiple waking episodes during the night, but no typical pattern of narcolepsy was found in the multiple sleep latency test. The patient had frequent urgent hospitalizations due to different diseases and numerous invasive procedures. Six month later, the patient obtained state related disability financial benefit, after which hospitalizations in various hospitals continued, and PNES became shorter and less pronounced.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Once the diagnosis is made, several treatment options are available.

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

On the one hand, sleep and circadian fluctuation of the state of vigilance have a marked influence on the occurrence of generalized and partial seizures as well as on the frequency, morphology and distribution of interictal epileptic discharges. On the other hand, a wide range of sleep disturbances has been documented in epileptics and there is some evidence that sleep disturbance and epilepsy may aggravate and perpetuate one another. Long-term EEG monitoring during sleep is of major importance when investigating epileptics with nocturnal attacks to determine whether these nocturnal episodes represent an ictal manifestation or an independent non-epileptic sleep disorder. In special forms of epilepsy, sleep recording is not only useful but necessary for the diagnosis. Various activation procedures are carried out on patients in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty regarding the presence or the type of epilepsy. Some of these procedures employ sleep: namely sedated sleep, sleep after sleep deprivation and all-night sleep recording. The diagnostic value and the indications of these activation studies are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Ten patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction (familial dysautonomia, juvenile diabetes, or Shy-Drager syndrome) were studied to assess the impact of their impairment on breathing during sleep. Several types of breathing dysfunction during sleep were identified independent of the patients' primary complaints. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was the most common; central sleep apnea and disturbances of the respiratory oscillator also were seen. Esophageal reflux was found to be the cause of some sleep-related problems. The observed respiratory irregularities were not associated with the usual cardiac response; a \"decoupling\" of heart rate from the respiratory cycle was noted during sleep in these patients.",

In this review the relationship between smoking and sleep is investigated, based on the existing literature. Tobacco smoking disrupts sleep architecture by reducing slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and undermining sleep quality. Furthermore, smoking affects sleep-related co-morbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), insomnia, parasomnias, arousals, bruxism, restless legs but also non-sleep-related conditions such as cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric, inflammatory, gynecologic and pediatric. This review aims to consolidate all the existing knowledge about the relationship between smoking and sleep.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

      "abstract": "The associations between depressive symptoms and hypersomnia are complex and often bidirectional. Of the many disorders associated with excessive sleepiness in the general population, the most frequent are mental health disorders, particularly depression. However, most mood disorder studies addressing hypersomnia have assessed daytime sleepiness using a single response, neglecting critical and clinically relevant information about symptom severity, duration and nighttime sleep quality. Only a few studies have used objective tools such as polysomnography to directly measure both daytime and nighttime sleep propensity in depression with normal mean sleep latency and sleep duration. Hypersomnia in mood disorders, rather than a medical condition per se, is more a subjective sleep complaint than an objective finding. Mood symptoms have also been frequently reported in hypersomnia disorders of central origin, especially in narcolepsy. Hypocretin deficiency could be a contributing factor in this condition. Further interventional studies are needed to explore whether management of sleep complaints improves mood symptoms in hypersomnia disorders and, conversely, whether management of mood complaints improves sleep symptoms in mood disorders.",

This study compared rest-activity rhythms in healthy older adults and PD patients with and without hallucinations. Twenty-nine older adults and 50 PD patients (27 with hallucinations, 23 without) were assessed using wrist-worn actigraphy for 5 days. Disease-related and cognitive data were also collected. PD patients demonstrated reduced amplitude of activity (F = 12.719, P < 0.01) and increased intradaily variability (F = 22.005, P < 0.001), compared to healthy older adults, independently of age, and cognitive status. Hallucinators showed lower interdaily stability (F = 7.493, P < 0.01) significantly greater activity during \"night-time\" (F = 6.080, P < 0.05) and significantly reduced relative amplitude of activity (F = 5.804, P < 0.05) compared to nonhallucinators, independently of clinical factors including motor fluctuations. PD patients with hallucinations display altered rest-activity rhythm characterized by an unpredictable circadian pattern across days, likely arising from damage to brainstem and hypothalamic sleep centers. Treatment of sleep and rest-activity rhythm disturbance is an important target in Parkinson's Disease.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysregulation. In addition, narcolepsy can be associated with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), often characterized by violent enactment of vivid dreams. We present a case of a recovering alcoholic with Narcolepsy Type 1, RBD, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A 39-year-old male with anxiety, depression, PTSD, prior alcohol dependence now 9 years sober presented to our sleep clinic complaining of frequent loud snoring, daytime somnolence with an Epworth sleepiness scale score of 18, and dream enactment behavior. The patient’s dream enactment behavior was frequently violent. Treatment with nighttime melatonin was initiated empirically for clinical suspicion of RBD. A split-night polysomnogram with expanded electromyography montage confirmed mild obstructive sleep apnea with an apnea hypopnea index of 5 events/hour as well as REM sleep without atonia. The patient was treated with positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) and despite adherence with PAP, excessive daytime sleepiness persisted. The patient then divulged development of cataplectic episodes while sharing emotional experiences at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. A repeat polysomnogram with PAP titration with multiple sleep latency test was performed which was notable for a mean sleep latency of 0.9 minutes and 2 sleep-onset REM periods, consistent with the diagnosis of Narcolepsy Type 1. Treatment with nighttime sodium oxybate was initiated as well as daytime amphetamines. Symptoms of cataplexy, daytime somnolence, and sleep quality all subsequently improved. Dream enactment behavior continued but improved in severity after up-titration of melatonin to 15 mg of melatonin nightly. History of frequent head trauma was subsequently reported at follow-up, and work-up for traumatic brain injury is pending (TBI). The relationship between RBD and narcolepsy was first described in 1992. RBD prevalence is increased in patients with narcolepsy type 1, with clinical symptoms in 45 to 61 percent of patients and polysomnographic signs in 36 to 43 percent of patients. There has been correlation of development of RBD in states of withdrawal from alcohol or barbiturate addiction, which may play a role in our patient’s history. None",

      "title": "Nocturnal sleep stereo-electroencephalography and polygraphy in epileptics.",
      "abstract": "Focal epileptic activity (FEA) in amygdalohippocampal complexes (AHC) is mostly highly intensive (except in patient BUK where it is nearly missing). Unilateral FEA is hardly ever propagated to the superficial EEG electrodes, bilateral FEA only very rarely (patients BRY and DUS), in some patients solely in deep synchronous sleep (patient LOB). FEA intensity rises in relaxed vigilance and in superficial sleep while tending to decrease in deep synchronous sleep. FEA intensity tends to drop or even disappear in active vigilance during mental activity or paradoxical sleep. Epileptic activity generalized in all the superficial and deep-implanted leads is mostly accompanied by clinical manifestations (absences, twitching, motor automatisms), or to put it the other way round: if a clinical paroxysms is in progress, there is evidence of generalized epileptic activity in all the leads. The time parameter is of no consequence, the inconspicuous motion of the hand is due to a second-lasting discharge of polyspike and wave (patient BRY in sleep). If prolonged discharges remain localized there is subclinical paroxysm (patient IRL). Similar findings were reported by Lieb et al. (1976). All we can add is that the start of an attack depends not only on the amplitude and frequency of the spikes but also on the regularity of spike intervals. Superficial \"neocortical\" EEG and deep \"paleocortical\" SEEG exhibit equal sleep stages equally, i.e. either there is synchronization in all the leads (like in synchronous sleep), or there is desynchronization (such as in active vigilance or in paradoxical sleep); those two cortical structures are not antithetical such as in, e.g., rats or cats. The sleep stages show quantitative as well as qualitative changes. There is increasingly more wakefulness and superficial sleep at the expense of spindle and paradoxical sleep. EEG graphoelements often show little differentiation, e.g. the sleep spindles are short and irregular in shape, delta activity is low in amplitude and also irregular in shape, and paradoxical sleep shows insufficient desynchronization in EEG and preserved tonic muscular activity. Epileptic activity variability is often found helpful for the reliable identification of the sleep stage concerned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Both forms of NFLE need to be distinguished from parasomnias, nocturnal temporal lobe epilepsy, and other nocturnal disorders. Eight consecutive cases of sporadic NFLE were evaluated at a sleep clinic in Taiwan. All patients had clinical evaluations, daytime waking and sleeping EEGs, brain MRIs, and overnight video-polysomnography (vPSG) with seizure montage. Gender was equal (four males, four females); mean age was 18.4 yrs (range, 7–41 yrs). Age of NFLE onset was by puberty. Premorbid history was negative for any neurologic, medical or psychiatric disorder. NFLE subtypes: nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia, n=6; paroxysmal arousals, n=2. MRI brain scan abnormalities with clinical correlates were found in one patient. Daytime awake EEGs were negative for ictal/interictal activity in all patients, but two patients had daytime sleep EEGs with interictal epileptiform EEG activity. During vPSG studies, three of eight patients with NFLE seizure events had concurrent epileptiform EEG activity, and two patients had interictal epileptiform EEG activity during their vPSG studies. No case had a spontaneous remission. Anticonvulsant therapy was highly effective in all eight cases (>75% reduction in seizure frequency). These cases confirm that sporadic NFLE closely resembles familial NFLE, and comprises a set of distinct clinical manifestations, with variable intensity, and variable scalp EEG epileptiform abnormalities across sleep and wakefulness, which have previously been identified in Caucasian patients from Europe and North America.",

To characterize more precisely the sleep and respiratory patterns associated with this disorder, polygraphic studies were made during sleep and wakefulness in 11 patients with this syndrome. These studies showed abnormal respiratory patterns during wakefulness, and abnormal sleep and electroencephalographic characteristics. The patients had decreased percentages of rapid-eye-movement sleep, and during wakefulness, a pattern of disorganized breathing was observed in all 11 patients and consisted of hypoxia followed by a period of increased respiratory rate and effort. The occurrence of disorganized breathing and compensatory hyperpnea during wakefulness with regular, continuous breathing during sleep is characteristic of Rett's syndrome and suggests an altered or impaired voluntary/behavioral respiratory control system.",

Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Agrypnia Excitata (AE) is a syndrome characterized by loss of sleep with permanent motor and autonomic hyper activation. This case describes this peculiar syndrome in a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis. Report of Case DG is a 35 yr old male with a history of anti-Ma2 limbic encephalitis secondary to cystic teratoma of the left testis diagnosed 6 months prior to presenting in Sleep Clinic. His parents described significant sleep disturbances including short sleep and wake periods throughout the day and night with no apparent pattern, acting out dreams, motor activity during sleep including pulling at his clothes or using his hands to manipulate invisible objects. Additionally they described low-grade fevers, and severe hyperphagia. Polysomnogram showed absence of slow-wave sleep and what appeared to be an admixture of stage 1 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) with rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Multiple sleep-latency testing (MSLT) demonstrated a mean sleep latency of 5.2 minutes and four sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed persistent inflammation of the mesial temporal lobes and hippocampal region. Cerebral spinal fluid testing showed persistent anti-Ma2 antibodies. Based on this clinical presentation we made a diagnosis of Agrypnia Excitata. Conclusion Agrypnia Excitata is a syndrome characterized by loss of the normal sleep-wake rhythm. Sleep consists of the disappearance of spindle-delta activities, and persistent stage 1 NREM sleep mixed with recurrent episodes of REM sleep. The second hallmark of AE is persistent motor and autonomic hyperactivity observed during wake and sleep. AE has been described in three distinct clinical syndromes: Morvan Syndrome (autoimmune encephalitis), Fatal Familial Insomnia, and Delirium tremens. The pathogenesis of AE consists of intra-limbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from cortico-limbic inhibitory control. In autoimmune encephalitis, antibodies that act on voltage-gated potassium channels within the limbic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "Perceived sleep need can vary among individuals. Even if it shows the same short sleeping duration, it may be caused by different reasons including insomnia symptom, a person who sleep less (short sleeper), or sleep deprivation. To answer this question, we need a fundamental approach to classify Chronic Insomnia Disorder (CID) from various sleep types and to examine neural mechanisms underlying their differences. The present study aim to explore whether brain response to sleep-related picture differs in CID and several sleep types. 55 participants were divided into four groups: 25 Chronic Insomnia Disorder according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria (CID; 21 female, age=46.9±12.8), 15 Good Sleepers (GS; 10 female, age=38.4±13.7), 9 Short Sleepers (SS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per day but not have insomnia symptoms; 4 female, age=40.4±12) and 6 Insufficient Sleepers (IS; sleep duration less than 6 hours per weekday and weekend over sleep more than 2 hours; 3 female, age=32.1±16.1). During fMRI, participants completed a sleep-related picture task. To examine group differences in brain response to sleep-related pictures vs. control pictures, one-way ANOVA was conducted. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed to test associations between neural response and clinical features including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS). CID showed significantly greater PSQI, ISI and DBAS scores than three other groups (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, CID group showed increased neural response to sleep-related pictures in bilateral insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, left postcentral gyrus, left posterior insula (p<0.001, cluster size=50). Brain response in these regions was positively correlated with PSQI and ISI scores (p<0.05). CID showed increased responses to sleep-related pictures in brain regions have been implicated in attention and emotional regulation. These results suggest that there may be attentional bias or emotional response to sleep-related pictures in CID patients.

Une altération de la continuité du sommeil et des anomalies de son architecture ont été objectivées dans cette affection. Une diminution de l'efficacité du sommeil, une augmentation du nombre d'éveils, une diminution du sommeil lent profond et surtout une activité alpha anormale en sommeil lent profond (activité alphadelta) seraient caractéristiques bien que non spécifiques de cette affection. Ces données ont de plus éte confirmées par l'analyse spectrale de l'activité EEG au cours du sommeil en retrouvant une augmentation de la puissance des bandes à hautes fréquences ainsi qu'une diminution de celle à basses fréquences. La présence d'une activité alpha-delta, de micro-éveils et de complexes K-alpha, témoins d'une fragmentation du sommeil, correspondent à une possible intrusion de l'éveil dans le sommeil et peuvent ainsi contribuer à l'altération de la fonction restauratrice du sommeil et ainsi expliquer en partie la symptomatologie diurne de ces patients. Toutefois ces activités alpha anormales ne sont pas spécifiques et sont observées chez des sujets sains privés de sommeil lent profond. Cette fragmentation anormale du sommeil n'est pas à mettre en rapport avec un trouble primaire du sommeil comme le syndrome d'apnées du sommeil et le syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs, bien que ces dermières conditions sont souvent concomitantes. La pathogénie de la fibromyalgie demeure toujours incertaine. Toutefois l'altération du métabolisme de certaines substances dont la sérotonine, la mélatonine et l'hormone de croissance a pu être objectivée. Cette affection est fréquente et apparaît multifactorielle malgré l'existence d'un débat sur les causes de la fibromyalgie, l'implication de facteurs psychologiques (anxiété), environnementaux, génétiques, neurochimiques et de leurs impacts sur la qualité du sommeil.

      "abstract": "Sleep disruption is a key clinical issue in the dementias but the sleep phenotypes of these diseases remain poorly characterised. Here we addressed this issue in a proof-of-principle study of 67 patients representing major syndromes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), in relation to 25 healthy older individuals. We collected reports on clinically-relevant sleep characteristics - time spent overnight in bed, sleep quality, excessive daytime somnolence and disruptive sleep events. Difficulty falling or staying asleep at night and excessive daytime somnolence were significantly more frequently reported for patients with both FTD and AD than healthy controls. On average, patients with FTD and AD retired earlier and patients with AD spent significantly longer in bed overnight than did healthy controls. Excessive daytime somnolence was significantly more frequent in the FTD group than the AD group; AD syndromic subgroups showed similar sleep symptom profiles while FTD subgroups showed more variable profiles. Sleep disturbance is a significant clinical issue in major FTD and AD variant syndromes and may be even more salient in FTD than AD. These preliminary findings warrant further systematic investigation with electrophysiological and neuroanatomical correlation in major proteinopathies.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

However, some antidepressant drugs do not affect paradoxical sleep, and other drugs, devoid of antidepressant properties, depress markedly the production of paradoxical sleep.

      "title": "Relationship between the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and reports of anomalous experiences.",
      "abstract": "A whole range of anomalous experiences (1) has been reported during the hypnagogic or hypnopompic states that surround periods of sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience brief, vivid, and often strange imagery or to find themselves temporarily unable to move or speak during these periods between wakefulness and sleep. These brief sensations and the temporary paralysis are known as hypnagogic or hypnopompic imagery and sleep paralysis, (2) respectively (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA], 1990). Recent surveys found that people who report more childhood experiences of hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery or sleep paralysis also report a greater number of anomalous experiences during childhood or adulthood (Sherwood, 1999, 2000). More specifically, hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery has been associated with reports of extrasensory perception (ESP), apparitions and communication with the dead, out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs), visions of past lives, and experiences involving extraterrestrials (e.g., Glicksohn, 1989; Gurney, Myers, & Podmore, 1886; Leaning, 1925; Mavromatis, 1983, 1987; McCreery, 1993; McKellar, 1957; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, & DuBreuil, 1993). In addition to the above anomalous experiences, sleep paralysis has also been associated with reports of psychokinesis (PK) and near-death experiences (NDEs) (Baker, 1992; Green & McCreery, 1994; Rose & Blackmore, 1996; Rose, Hogan, & Blackmore, 1997; Spanos et al., 1993; Spanos, McNulty, DuBreuil, Pires, & Burgess, 1995). The question is: are the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states conducive to anomalous processes and events or are normal hypnagogic/hypnopompic features being misinterpreted? Perhaps both statements are true? The aim of this article is to consider evidence for each of these possibilities. First, it is necessary to outline the characteristics of the hypnagogic/hypnopompic states and the features of some of the experiences that can occur within them. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYPNAGOGIC/HYPNOPOMPIC STATES Most research, both experimental and survey-based, seems to have focused on the hypnagogic state (the period between wakefulness and sleep, i.e., just as a person is falling asleep). Comparatively little research has been carried out on the hypnopompic state (the period between sleep and wakefulness, i.e., just as a person is waking from sleep). Thus, this article focuses mainly on the hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic state, like the sleep state, is fairly complex and contains a number of steps and stages (Mavromatis, 1983; Rechtschaffen, 1994). Hori, Hayashi, and Morikawa (1994) concluded that the sleep onset period is unique and cannot be accurately categorised as either waking or sleeping. It is very difficult to determine the precise point of falling asleep, except by using arbitrary criteria, because the transition is gradual, because the changes are not always synchronised, and because there are large individual differences in when the changes occur (Lavie, 1996; Rechtschaffen, 1994). During alert wakefulness, eye movements are fairly rapid, and the normal EEC trace consists of irregular waves of high frequency (Bray, Cragg, Macknight, Mills, & Taylor, 1992). As a person relaxes or becomes drowsy, there is an increase in alpha activity (8-12 Hz), and eye movements become slower and less frequent (Parker, 1975; Rechtschaffen, 1994). In fact, the presence of slow eye movements is considered to be an extremely accurate indicator of hypnagogic mentation (Schacter, 1976). Stickgold and Hobson (1994) found that as the period of eyelid movement quiescence lengthens, that is, as the eyelids move less, mentation becomes more dreamlike. This contrasts with the positive association between eyelid movements and dreamlike mentation during REM sleep. As a person passes through the hypnagogic period into the early stages of non-REM sleep, there is a decline in alpha activity and a concomitant increase in slower theta activity (4-7 Hz; Baddia, Wright, & Wauquier, 1994; Bray et al. …",

      "title": "1195 Sleep-related Hallucinations",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sleep-related hallucinations, encompassing visual and auditory experiences pose a complex clinical challenge. Here, we illustrate 2 cases with diverse underlying etiologies. Report of case(s) Case 1: 76-year-old male with 3 months of nocturnal visual hallucinations, occurring 3-5 nights per week. These ranged from familiar and unfamiliar faces and characters reminiscent of movies. Symptoms occurred when waking up in the middle of the night, with difficulty returning to sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) unveiled moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) without findings indicative of parasomnias and no symptoms on the night of PSG. Brain MRI revealed chronic infarcts involving right basal ganglia and bilateral optic radiations. Lesions of structures that commonly cause visual hallucinations (optic lens, retina, thalamus, midbrain) were absent. The frequency of episodes decreased to 1-2 per month after initiating CPAP therapy. Potential mechanism of improvement could be PAP mediated optimization of perfusion to the ischemic penumbra. Case 2: 93-year-old male with an eight-year history of insomnia due to musical hallucinations (MH). Auditory experiences included church and semi-classical music, with 80% being familiar tunes. The patient, a former church choir member, has a history of progressive hearing loss and tinnitus. Brain MRI/MRA revealed chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes. Extended EEG showed no evidence of seizures. Audiometry confirmed moderate-severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. No response was seen to Levetiracetam, Gabapentin, Donepezil and behavioral therapy. Home sleep study revealed severe OSA. CPAP therapy did not result in improvement of MH. MH improved significantly with Lorazepam. Hypoacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication are common etiologies for MH. The etiology in this case is very likely due to hypoacusis. The hypothesis is deafferentation resulting in release phenomenon or spontaneous activity in the auditory pathway, manifesting as MH. Conclusion Sleep-related and nocturnal hallucinations warrant a comprehensive evaluation. Differential diagnoses include neurological causes, including stroke, seizure, Multiple Sclerosis, tumor, vascular lesions, and neurodegenerative disorders. Other etiologies include psychiatric disorders, medications, alcohol, otologic and ophthalmic pathologies. It is also reasonable to evaluate for comorbid OSA as appropriate treatment may decrease the frequency of episodes and improve overall sleep in some patients. Support (if any)",

      "title": "The Utility of Routine EEG in the Diagnosis of Sleep Disordered Breathing",
      "abstract": "Summary: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common medical condition. Its manifestations of snoring, nocturnal choking, arousals, and sleep fragmentation can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, neuropsychological slowing, lapses of consciousness, and accidents that can be misinterpreted as epileptic phenomena. Moreover, patients with documented epilepsy commonly exhibit similar symptomatology because of the undiagnosed coexistence of sleep apnea. Therefore, a large proportion of patients referred to the electroencephalogram (EEG) laboratory primarily to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy could suffer from latent sleep apnea and the routine EEG has the potential to divulge it. We retrospectively evaluated the reporting of sleep apnea symptomatology (snoring, choking, gasping/deep breath, apnea, desaturation, excessive drowsiness) in routine inpatient and outpatient adult EEG studies performed in our institution over the past 12 years (39,130 studies, approximately half of which recorded at least early stages of sleep). Comparisons were performed with the medical records to ascertain the coexistence of objectively diagnosed SDB with polysomnography before or after the EEG study and the importance of reporting variations in assisting with the diagnosis. Two illustrative examples are provided. Sixty-nine EEG studies were identified, performed primarily to confirm, or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. The mean age of the subjects at EEG was 64 years (range 30–89), and 55 (80%) were male. 36% of them suffered from known epilepsy. Snoring was the most commonly reported sign in 48 (70%) of the studies, followed by arousals in 29 (42%), apnea in 16 (23%), excessive drowsiness in 13 (19%), gasping/deep breath in 9 (13%), and desaturation in 7 (10%). A sleep disorder was suggested in 25 (36%) of the interpretations and a direct recommendation for a sleep study was made in 22 of them (32%). This interpretation was included in the impression of the report in 21 (30%) of the cases, in the detail in 20 (30%) of the cases and in both in 28 (40%). Only 14 (20%) patients underwent polysomnography, and all of them were formally diagnosed with SDB. Seven (50%) of them were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, 2 (14%) with central sleep apnea, 3 (22%) with both, 1 (7%) with upper airways resistance syndrome, and 1 (7%) with primary snoring. From these 14 patients, 9 (64%) were diagnosed with a sleep study performed after the EEG, 4 (29%) before the EEG interpretation, and 1 (7%) had a repeat study after the EEG. In the logistic regression model applied, with the exception of the presence of arousals (odds ratio = 4.63, P = 0.033), none of the aforementioned symptomatology or the reporting of suspicion for SDB or the location (impression vs. detail) of the reporting showed a statistically significant association with the completion of a sleep study. Routine EEG offers a unique opportunity of direct clinical observation along with electrophysiologic and cardiorespiratory monitoring. When sleep is recorded, it can help identify clinical and electrographic features of sleep apnea and prompt confirmation with a polysomnogram in the appropriate clinical context. It can therefore serve as a valuable, adjunctive tool for the diagnosis of SDB. Our data highlight that potential but unveil its decreased use in the neurology community. Increased awareness is required by the EEG technologists, interpreting neurologists, and referring physicians, regarding reporting and using sleep apnea features on the EEG.",

      "title": "Current Problems in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA QUENTIN R. REGESTEIN* and PETER REICHf Recently, interest has grown in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Over 2 decades of laboratory research have yielded information that may further rationalize treatment ofdisordered sleep. Reviews have appeared discussing newer understanding and treatments for sleep problems [1, 2], and attempts are being made to forge standardized classifications for sleep disorders. Special clinics for the management of these problems are now being organized upon the notion that greater specificity in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is at hand. Insomnia is perhaps the most common sleep disorder faced by physicians . Insomnia must be distinguished from lack of sleep. Only a tinyfraction of insomniacs is ever objectively examined for the amount of sleep actually obtained, and such examinations when done last but 1 or 2 nights. The results of the examination, when done, are not always consistent with the patient's estimation of sleep loss, yet the patient may continue to complain of insomnia in the absence of objective substantiation ofsleep loss and persist in his demands for relief. For these reasons, we define insomnia as the complaint of sleep loss. Despite the years of clinical experience in treating insomnia and the added understanding of sleep more recently accrued from research, there remain several problems that prevent agreement on how to classify insomnia. Specificity in diagnosing and treating insomnia is therefore hindered. This paper is meant to articulate these problems in order to reconcile for the practitioner the broad, prolonged clinical experience accumulated with insomnia and the relative lack of specificity for its treatment. We will attempt to describe some of the difficulties surround- *Sleep Clinic, Division of Psychiatry, Department of Medicine, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, 721 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02115; associate in medicine and assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. tPhysician, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital; and associate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.© 1978 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/78/2102-0006S01.00 232 I Quentin R. Regestein and Peter Reich ¦ Chronic Insomnia ing both the diagnosis and the treatment of insomnia, in order, we hope, to guide further attempts to understand and relieve insomnia patients. Diagnosis Five percent of adult patients from a general medical practice presented complained of insomnia [3], 20 percent in a similar group admitted some sort of sleep disturbance [3], and 45 percent of adults in an epidemiological survey reported difficulties in falling asleep or staying asleep [4]. This remarkable prevalence may contribute to the lack of systematic classification for insomnia. Chronic insomnia is so common that some may consider it a normal experience rather than a pathological problem [5]. Although chronic insomnia may signify severe mental or physical derangement and correlate with augmented death rates [6], much insomnia is mild and temporary. A complaint that subsides rather than persists excites little interest. Nevertheless, much insomnia remains chronic, poses great difficulty for patient and practitioner, and still remains unclassified. The frequency of psychopathology among insomniac patients provides a second reason why insomnia has not been classified. Insomnia can stem from mental problems of all kinds, and many of these are not rapidly treatable. Chronic insomniacs are said to be complaining, oversensitive people [7]. In two series ofinsomnia patients, over 85% ofthose 274 subjects tested showed pathological scores on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an elevation in the depression scale being most common [8, 9]. Even poor sleepers, discovered through research questionnaires rather than through clinical practice, prove to be anxious, depressed, obsessively worried types [10]. Furthermore, many insomniac patients depend on drugs [H]. Chronic insomnia, therefore, associated with chronic psychological troubles and complicated by drug abuse, may be considered an unattractive problem by many physicians. In these respects it resembles alcoholism by inviting disproportionately small clinical interest. Perhaps, for this reason, characterizing insomnia has recently been left to the psychiatrists, even though prescribing for insomnia is done mostly by other physicians [12]. Certain difficulties arise whenever conditions involving much psychopathology are categorized. The rich diversity of personalities and psychological disorders are not neatly categorized. They are, furthermore , enmeshed in the unique complexity of behavioral traits that characterize every person. Psychiatric nosology, therefore...",

      "abstract": "We report the case of a 43-year-old woman presenting with nocturnal episodes of pain and screaming during sleep starting at age 30. There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",

These circadian rhythm sleep disorders are characterized by a misalignment between the timing of the sleep period with respect to the day-night cycle and as a consequence of patients attempting to maintain 'normal' social hours, reduced sleep quality. In addition to the specific circadian rhythm sleep disorders, this review will also examine current drug (e.g., hypnotics and melatonin) and nondrug (e.g., bright light therapy and chronotherapy) treatments, the overlap with psychophysiological insomnia and future directions.",

But for people with insomnia disorder, sleep problems happen at least 3 nights each week for at least 3 stretch. Insomnia disorder can affect daily life. It can affect job and personal relationships. Insomnia disorder may also increase risk for heart disease. There are many things that trigger insomnia like stress, anxiety, alcohol, tobacco, looking at bright screens, working shifts and too much of caffeine. Once these tricks go away, the insomnia may continue and head to insomnia disorder. This may happen because of habits formed because of insomnia (such as napping, getting in bed before being sleepy, and lying-in bed awake for long periods of time). Insomnia disorder can also sometimes appear on its own with no known cause.",

      "title": "Are sleep disturbances risk factors for anxiety, depressive and addictive disorders?",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

As the determinants of daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation is more influential than nocturnal hypoxia. Daytime sleepiness can be improved by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or surgery in up to 95% of the treated subjects. Both sleepiness and nocturnal hypoxia would cause cognitive dysfunction. While impairments in attention and verbal memory are more related with sleepiness and prominent in mild to moderate sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), impairments in general intellectual function and executive function are more related with nocturnal hypoxia and prominent in severe SAS. Several cognitive deficits related with nocturnal hypoxia may be irreversible despite CPAP or surgical treatments. So, early detection and early appropriate treatment of SAS would prevent sleepiness and cognitive deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas de sueno son una de las quejas mas frecuentes en los pacientes que sufren fibromialgia. Aunque tradicionalmente se ha asumido que el dolor es la causa de los problemas de sueno de estas personas, las evidencias al respecto muestran que la relacion entre estas variables es mas compleja. Por una parte, diversos estudios experimentales (tanto de restriccion de sueno como de induccion de dolor durante el sueno) e investigaciones clinicas (transversales y longitudinales) sugieren que las relaciones entre sueno y dolor podrian ser bidireccionales. De esta manera, el dolor perturbaria tanto la calidad como la continuidad del sueno (ya sea en forma de despertares o en forma de arousals que aligeran el sueno y, por lo tanto, modifican la arquitectura del sueno) y un sueno de mala calidad agravaria la experiencia de dolor (al disminuir los umbrales nociceptivos). Por otra parte, existen estructuras cerebrales comunes tanto a los mecanismos asociados a la modulacion del dolor como a los asociados al funcionamiento del ciclo sueno-vigilia. Por lo tanto, es esperable la existencia de alteraciones estructurales y funcionales en el sistema nervioso central de los pacientes con fibromialgia. Este hecho sugiere que el tratamiento de los problemas de sueno podria ser un objetivo terapeutico crucial en los pacientes con fibromialgia, ya que los potenciales beneficios irian mas alla de la mejora del sueno y se relacionarian con una disminucion de la intensidad del dolor y cambios positivos en otros sintomas asociados (como pueden ser el distres psicologico, el funcionamiento diario o la ejecucion neuropsicologica). La presente tesis se ha planteado para intentar dar respuesta a varios de los interrogantes acerca de las interrelaciones que se dan entre el sueno y el dolor en pacientes con fibromialgia, intentando superar ciertas limitaciones habituales en este tipo de estudios (asociadas principalmente a una evaluacion inadecuada del sueno).",

      "abstract": "Camptocormia (a flexion of the trunk that only appears when standing or walking) affects a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As it responds poorly to levodopa and is associated with reduced midbrain and pons volume, it may result from non-dopaminergic, brainstem lesions. As several sleep abnormalities in PD also result from non-dopaminergic brainstem lesions, we monitored sleep in 24 non-demented PD patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 12) camptocormia and in 12 controls. Nearly half (42%) patients with camptocormia had abnormal periodic leg movement indices (>15/h), versus 17% patients without camptocormia and 8% of controls (p = 0.02). In addition, the percentage of enhanced muscle activity during REM sleep (measured on the chin and on the limb muscles) tended to be higher in patients with than without camptocormia (51 +/- 39% vs. 20 +/- 25%, p = 0.06). The other sleep and REM sleep characteristics (sleep and REM sleep onset latencies, sleep time and sleep stage percentages, REMs density, arousal, and apnea-hypopnea indices) were not different between these two PD groups. Lesions causing this axial dystonia may spare the sleep systems but affect the control of movements during sleep.",

In clinical practice, this definition of epilepsy is usually taken to mean at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 h apart. The operational definition for special circumstances that do not meet the criteria of two unprovoked attacks has been recommended. In 2014, the ILAE refined the practical definition of epilepsy. With this definition, epilepsy is a disease of the brain with either: (1) at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals past the applicable age of an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome or those who have remained seizure-free for the past 10 years, without seizure medicines for the past 5 years.

We investigated 10 PD patients with sleep attacks and compared them with 10 PD patients without any daytime sleepiness. The patients were matched according to their dopaminergic medication and subjected to a sleep medical investigation. The mean sleep latency on the multiple sleep latency test was in the normal range and not significantly different between the groups.

      "abstract": "From the Resident Doctor’s Point of View: Is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Rightly an Orphan in Hypertensiology? The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a highly prevalent sleep-associated breathing disturbance characterized by multiple cessations of respiration during sleep that induce partial arousals and interfere with the physiological cyclic shift between various sleep stages, being responsible for reduced depth of sleep and for daytime somnolence. OSA may be asymptomatic. The most frequent clinical syndrome, defined as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, includes obstructive sleep apnea and associated symptoms often extending also to wakefulness, such as impaired cognitive function and daytime somnolence. In the general population, prevalence of OSAS is 4 % in men and 2 % in women. In hypertension, the prevalence of OSA is even higher: approximately 50 % in essential hypertension and up to 85 % in therapy-refractory hypertension. However, OSA is diagnosed only in 25 %! OSA is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and – especially in patients under 50 years of age – with increased mortality. Currently, there is a lack of firm evidence for lifestyle changes for treatment of OSA and hypertension. However, use of CPAP has been consistently shown to reduce blood pressure in OSA, but the average reduction of 24hour blood pressure was only 2 mmHg in 4 meta-analyses including 16 randomized studies (818 patients)! Methodological differences may be the cause of this low blood pressure reduction: placebo-controlled shortand long-term studies, different patient numbers, and a heterogeneous AHI. Crucial for the success of CPAP is the severity of OSA (the higher the AHI the greater the blood pressure reduction) and the adherence to CPAP therapy (minimum 5 hours per night, reduction of AHI > 50 %, optimal AHI < 10 per hour). Patients with treatment-resistant hypertension may have more robust responses: a significant reduction of day-time blood pressure by 14/9 mmHg and night-time blood pressure by 8/3 mmHg was reported after 2 months of CPAP therapy. Obese patients with arterial hypertension, patients with isolated nocturnal hypertension or a non-dipping pattern should be screened by polygraphy and in case of OSA referred to a sleep laboratory for CPAP therapy. In conclusion, from the resident doctor’s point of view, OSA unjustly is an “orphan” in hypertensiology. This paper is intended to stimulate awareness and screening for OSA.

      "title": "Nuevas aplicaciones de la hipoxia intermitente en un modelo animal de apnes del sueño",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de apneas-hipopneas del sueno (SAHS) es una enfermedad cronica caracterizada por el colapso total (apnea) o parcial (hipopnea) de la via aerea superior durante el sueno. Estos eventos respiratorios, que pueden producirse repetidas veces durante la noche, provocan episodios de hipoxemia intermitente, un incremento de la actividad neurovegetativa, marcados aumentos de presion intratoracica negativa, y fragmentacion del sueno. Estos fenomenos, y en especial la hipoxia intermitente, pueden desencadenar procesos inflamatorios y de estres oxidativo sistemicos, y estan asociados a una serie de consecuencias clinicas cardiovasculares, metabolicas y neurocognitivas, entre otras. Esta tesis tiene, por un lado, el objetivo de estudiar posibles nuevas implicaciones de la hipoxia intermitente en diferentes sistemas mediante un modelo de raton de apneas del sueno, y por otro presentar un nuevo modelo experimental basado en la parabiosis para el estudio de los efectos locales y sistemicos de la hipoxia. Se plantean cinco hipotesis: 1) la hipoxia intermitente cronica interacciona con el nivel de testosterona en la induccion de osteoporosis en ratones macho; 2) la hipoxia intermitente cronica induce un proceso inflamatorio en corazon y cerebro de ratones hembra que es modulado por los estrogenos; 3) la hipoxia intermitente cronica induce hipoxia/reoxigencion en el tejido del testiculo, con consiguiente estres oxidativo y disminucion de la calidad espermatica, con el resultado de una reduccion de la fertilidad masculina; 4) la hipoxia intermitente cronica produce hipoxia/reoxigenacion en el epitelio intestinal, modificando a su vez los microambientes donde habitan las bacterias intestinales y produce cambios en la composicion de su microbiota; 5) la parabiosis es un modelo experimental que permite separar los efectos de la hipoxia, continua o intermitente, y diferenciar entre las consecuencias de la hipoxia local y las consecuencias de la hipoxia a nivel sistemico provocada por los mediadores en sangre. Los datos obtenidos en los estudios que se han llevado a cabo para probar estas hipotesis sugieren que: 1) la hipoxia intermitente per se no altera el metabolismo oseo, aunque para descartar una posible asociacion entre este y el SAHS haran falta mas estudios tanto clinicos como experimentales; 2) el impacto del SAHS en las mujeres podria ser modificado por la menopausia y se deben estudiar las consecuencias que este sindrome puede tener, dada su prevalencia, en esta poblacion; 3) la hipoxia intermitente podria reducir la fertilidad de hombres con SAHS; 4) las consecuencias del SAHS podrian estar en parte moduladas por la alteracion en la microbiota intestinal como resultado de la hipoxia intermitente. Para determinar si realmente existe una asociacion entre el SAHS y estas nuevas posibles consecuencias, y son clinicamente relevantes, sera necesario llevar a cabo estudios con pacientes. Finalmente, se ha mostrado que: 5) los efectos locales y sistemicos de la hipoxia intermitente asociada al SAHS se pueden estudiar de manera aislada mediante el modelo de parabiosis en raton.",

      "title": "Insomnia disorder and endogenous neurophysiological dynamics",
      "abstract": "Insomnia symptoms are the most common medical complaints, affecting up to a third of the general population. Insomnia symptoms include sleep problems (initiating or maintaining sleep) as well their repercussions on wake-time functioning. Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in children have a negative impact on mental and physical development, and a lack of sleep is one of the most important problems in infancy. At the age when naps are commonly accepted, the judgment of whether the amount of sleep is adequate has been based on the total amount of sleep per day. In other words, the idea is that even if the amount of sleep at night is insuﬃcient, it is not considered insuﬃcient if it is compensated for by taking a long nap or sleeping late on weekend mornings. However, these lifestyle habits disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause social jet lag, which is not appropriate for healthy mental and physical development. Therefore, in this review, I present the average required nighCime basic sleep duration (NBSD) of 10 h for Japanese and 11 h for Caucasian children as a judgment standard. (1) If the child sleeps less than 8 h at night, and (2) if the child sleeps less than 9 h at night or 30 to 60 min less than the required NBSD, immediate treatment is recommended. I also discuss briefly how to address sleep insufficiency in childhood.",

      "title": "1157 Obstructive Sleep Apnea Symptoms Caused by an Occult Seizure Disorder with a Brain Tumor Focus",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Complex nocturnal behaviors are one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in sleep medicine. The sensitivity of electroencephalography (EEG) varies with the study duration, epileptogenic lesion location, electrode placement, and the presence of events. A normal isolated EEG is insufficient to exclude an underlying seizure disorder particularly when diagnostic uncertainty remains. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and that has demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between OSA and comorbid epilepsy. This case report highlights an adolescent male with seizure-like symptoms initially diagnosed with OSA with refractory nocturnal episodes on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for years until his eventual clinical diagnosis that was prompted by a repeat PSG. Report of case(s) A 14-year-old biological male with a history of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness reported multiple episodes of unresponsiveness during sleep associated with shaking activity and self-reported desaturation at home. Initial episodes terminated upon repositioning of his body, however episodes and symptoms persisted despite treatment with positional therapy and CPAP. He had no clinical episodes during an unrevealing 72-hour EEG study. A repeat diagnostic PSG demonstrated an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI4%) of 1.1 events/hour, an AHI3A of 5.3 events/hour, and an SpO2 nadir of 92%. When the lights were turned on the patient exhibited repetitive facial movement upon awakening with poly-spikes on the corresponding EEG leads. This was followed by an inpatient admission for continuous EEG that demonstrated focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure during sleep of left-sided origin. MRI showed a 1.7 cm left basal temporal lobe tumor that was likely the seizure focus. He was discharged on levetiracetam, and ultimately underwent a posterior temporal lesion resection with resolution of his symptoms, including paroxysmal events and excessive daytime sleepiness. Conclusion Suspected nocturnal seizures often requires comprehensive and repeated testing modalities as an interictal EEG may fail to detect a seizure disorder and the presence of OSA does not eliminate the possibility of comorbid epilepsy. It is paramount to maintain a heightened index of suspicion as untreated OSA and epilepsy may have additive detrimental health effects. Appropriate identification as in our case may have a curative effect. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Problemas para dormir—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Los problemas para dormir son comunes en los niños con y sin trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre la mitad y un tercio de los niños con TEA tienen problemas para dormir. Esto puede causar problemas durante el día, como falta de atención, irritabilidad o exhibición de más comportamientos repetitivos. La cantidad de horas de sueño durante la noche que necesitan los niños en edad preescolar, en general, es de 10 a 13 horas. A medida que crecen, el tiempo se reduce. Para los 13 años, la cantidad habitual de sueño necesaria es de entre 8 y 11 horas. Los problemas para dormir pueden afectar también a los padres y cuidadores, además del niño, porque los padres pierden horas de sueño al estar atendiendo a un niño que está despierto.Los niños con TEA pueden tener muchos motivos para no dormir. Las causas pueden ser médicas, de comportamiento o ambas. Las causas médicas de los problemas para dormir pueden incluir alergias, problemas para respirar y reflujo gastroesofágico (molestias estomacales).Los medicamentos también pueden afectar el sueño. Los motivos de comportamiento que causan problemas para dormir pueden ser cambios en las rutinas diarias o de la hora de acostarse, estrés en casa o en la escuela, cambio de cuidadores o cualquier otra cosa que rompa el patrón habitual de su hijo.El sueño tiene ciclos con distintos patrones de ondas cerebrales. Estos patrones pueden ser distintos en algunas personas con TEA. Es posible que las personas con TEA tengan el sueño más liviano y sueñen menos más tarde en la noche. Ese es el momento en que frecuentemente ocurre el despertar durante la noche. La hormona llamada melatonina es producida por el cerebro para controlar el sueño. Algunos estudios científicos muestran que las personas con TEA posiblemente no tengan la misma cantidad o actividad de melatonina.Algunos problemas para dormir incluyen:El médico de su hijo puede realizarle un examen físico general y obtener los antecedentes de problemas de salud y para dormir. Trate de llevar un diario del sueño durante un tiempo para ayudar al médico del niño a comprender los hábitos de sueño de su hijo. Informe al médico del niño si su hijo ronca fuerte o si tiene problemas de respiración por la noche y cualquier otra afección de salud que pudiera tener su hijo. El pediatra del niño podría pedirle pruebas si la historia clínica o el resultado del examen físico sugirieran que hay motivos médicos que causan los problemas de sueño.Los estudios han demostrado que las estrategias de comportamiento ayudan más que los medicamentos a mejorar los problemas para dormir. Estos son algunos pasos que pueden ayudar:En ocasiones, el solo hecho de crear buenos hábitos de sueño ayuda con los problemas para dormir, pero tal vez se necesiten otras medidas.Muchos niños con TEA responden a las órdenes y a las recompensas al intentar cambiar sus comportamientos. Repase junto a su hijo lo que espera que haga, con anticipación y nuevamente cada noche. Piense en la posibilidad de usar una tabla de imágenes o una historia para describir la rutina de la hora de acostarse. Si su hijo se ha quedado en la cama, ofrézcale una recompensa por la mañana, como un dulce que le guste, un juego o un ratito para usar pantallas.Si los problemas para dormir continúan después de establecer un buen lugar para que su hija duerma y una rutina para dormir adecuadas, tal vez desee agregar el paso de ignorarla cuando lo llame desde su cama. Cuando deje a su hija en la habitación, diga “buenas noches” y felicítela por irse a la cama. Luego vaya a controlarla en los momentos en que usted haya decidido hacerlo (generalmente cada pocos minutos) e ignórela entre los controles. Extienda el tiempo entre los controles durante la noche y en el transcurso de los días siguientes. Cuando vaya a controlar, échele un vistazo a la habitación. Si su hija está despierta, dígale que se duerma y luego váyase. No hay problema si su hija se duerme en el piso.Es muy importante que todos los cuidadores respeten este paso; hable con el resto de su familia sobre este plan antes de implementarlo. Si vive en un apartamento o condominio, tal vez también quiera hablar con sus vecinos. Los llantos y berrinches de su hija empeorarán durante varios días, pero con el tiempo mejorarán. Es fundamental que respete su plan y lo lleve adelante de la misma manera durante al menos 2 semanas, de principio a fin, para poder notar una diferencia. Tal vez necesite ayuda adicional para hacer esto, ya que puede ser difícil y agotador para padres y cuidadores.Algunos niños con TEA necesitan atención permanente para mantenerlos a salvo debido a sus comportamientos. Si su hija corre riesgo de lastimarse cuando no la esté supervisando y suele despertarse mucho durante la noche, pruebe las siguientes medidas de seguridad:El pediatra de su hija puede sugerir el uso de medicamentos recetados o de venta libre junto con el entrenamiento del comportamiento. Debe hablar con el médico de su hija antes de probar cualquier medicamento o suplemento herbal para su hija.Si aplicó este consejo todos los días durante 2 semanas y su hija sigue teniendo problemas para dormir, debe hablar con el pediatra de la niña. Hay otras intervenciones del comportamiento que se pueden usar.Los problemas muy difíciles deberán ser consultados con un experto en el sueño.La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder characterized by cessation of breathing during sleep, oxygen desaturation and awakenings during night. There are several types of breathing disorders during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also characterized by snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is less common and characterized by reduced respiratory drive from the central nervous system. Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, absence ofapneas, hypopneas and lack of significant oxygen desaturation. The consequences of the abnormal breathing during sleep include excessive daytime sleepiness, development of arterial hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, neurocognitive dysfunction, glaucomic optico-neuropathy, metabolic dysfunction. The early diagnosis requires detailed anamnestic data, standardized questionnaires for detection of sleep disordered breathing and whole-night polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. Obstructive sleep apnea can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, and surgery (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, UPPP). Early diagnosis of OSA enables early treatment, improvement of its symptoms and eventually reduces development of co-morbidities.",

The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked. The nocturnal disturbances are usually of more concern to the bed partner who may incur injuries from violent dream enactment.",

      "abstract": "Headache pain impacts most of the population at some point in life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence and severity of headaches has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between headaches and sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both headaches and sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep and headaches in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower headache frequency and severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower headache severity and shorter headache duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer headache duration and greater headache severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater headache severity and is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality and headache severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep and headache.",

      "title": "0806 REM sleep without atonia in the Setting of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Can it Serve a Protective Role?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has well-known associations with sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation. These disorders naturally follow from the progressive muscle weakness that is the hallmark of DMD. New data is emerging on the prevalence of other polysomnographic features affecting patients with DMD, particularly as they relate to the phenotype of the sleep disorders unique to DMD. We report on a patient with REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in DMD. Report of Cases: A 13-year-old male with DMD was referred for a polysomnogram (PSG) due to new-onset snoring, but there was no history to suggest dream enactment behavior. He was not taking any CNS-acting medication such as serotonergic or sedative-hypnotic medications. Neurologic examination was notable for diffuse symmetric muscle weakness requiring the use of a wheelchair. PSG revealed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with an apnea-hypopnea index of 3/hr overall and 5/hr during REM sleep, a respiratory disturbance index of 9/hr with minimum O saturation of 84%, and evidence of RWA in three 30-second epochs meeting AASM scoring criteria. Dream-enactment behavior was absent during the PSG and historically. Conclusion We report on a previously unrecognized finding of RWA the setting of DMD. While sleep studies are routinely performed in DMD due to the significant association with sleep-disordered breathing and REM-related hypoventilation, the presence of RWA was unusual. The finding of RWA in the setting of a dystrophinopathy prompts important questions. While it is unlikely that RWA is an emerging sign of an ⍺-synucleinopathy in the setting of DMD, its presence in a young teenager raises the possibility of hypocretin deficiency in the setting of DMD, as is the case with myotonic dystrophy type 1 reflecting impaired hypocretin neurotransmission. However, a more attractive explanation is that RWA may promote a protective effect against sleep apnea in patients with vulnerability to REM-related hypoventilation. Our data suggest a potential protective role conferred by the preservation of muscle tone in the setting of sleep apnea in neuromuscular conditions. Support (If Any) None",

Early case reports and case series discussed the typical hypoventilation in sleepy, red-faced, morbidly obese individuals known as Pickwickian Syndrome after Charles Dickens’s fictional character “Joe, the fat boy”. Symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) afflicts an estimated 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women aged 30-70 years (1). OSA is characterized by repeated pharyngeal obstructions during sleep causing airflow cessation (apnea) or reduction (hypopnea). Number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, apnea + hypopnea index (AHI), is used to index severity of OSA. OSA events produce arousals, fragment sleep, and are often accompanied by oxygen desaturation. Common symptoms include daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, disturbed sleep, memory problems, snoring, morning headache, waking up feeling unrefreshed, witnessed apnea, and diminished quality of life (2,3). Recent epidemiological studies link untreated OSA to hypertension, heart disease, stroke, psychiatric comorbid conditions and increased risk of",

The true extent of the problem is not known, but it seems certain that these syndromes are much more common than was generally assumed five years ago. Every clinician should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea because of the rapid and prompt response to therapeutic measures. Sleep apnea syndromes, whether obstructive or central, can result in systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arterial blood gas abnormalities, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, chronic respiratory failure, sleep disturbances, narcolepsy, excessive daytime somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and the suspicion of mental retardation. The immediate and dramatic improvement produced by tracheostomy in the obstructive type of sleep apnea, or nocturnal ventilatory support in the central type, can not only enhance the quality of life for these patients, but return them to functional and productive lives.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

In most cases, the diagnosis of sleep apnea is straightforward with patients having symptoms of snoring, choking or gasping for air while asleep and witnessed apneas. However, sleep apnea is known to present in some unusual ways. We present a case of a 61-year-old male, with recently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (currently not on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) and a history of seizure-like events since the age of 18 years, who came to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) for spell characterization of his frequent seizure-like episodes. A continuous video electroencephalogram (vEEG) performed in order to determine the semiology of these spells showed that all the spells were triggered by an arousal from sleep with an associated apneic event. He was started on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which resulted in the gradual decline in the number as well as the severity of his seizure-like spells. Based on the observations from vEEG monitoring and the patient's response, we concluded these seizure-like events as non-epileptic spells, triggered by apnea-related arousals in the context of OSA.",

A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues.

The differential diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events includes parasomnia, seizures during sleep or a psychogenic disturbance. Parasomnia classification is usually based on the sleep phase during which the parasomnia occurs. Seizures seen in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) are sleep-related seizures that may be difficult to distinguish from other paroxysmal events at night. This is because the motor activity and vocalization may resemble other paroxysmal events with features such as cycling movements of the lower limbs and because patients may be partially responsive during the seizures.",

      "title": "Psychophysiological insomnia: the behavioural model and a neurocognitive perspective",
      "abstract": "A number of paradoxes are apparent in the assessment and treatment of psychophysiological insomnia and sleep state misperception. Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective-objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more 'sleep-like' EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset-related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.",

In 25 healthy subjects, variable amounts of sleep loss (1-3 h for 1-3 nights) caused headaches lasting from 1 h to all day. The headache was most frequently a dull ache, a heaviness or a pressure sensation felt in the forehead and/or at the vertex. Simple analgesics, purchaseable without a doctor's prescription, completely or markedly reduced the head pain in 20-60 min. Headaches due to insufficient sleep differ from tension headaches in their site, duration and response to analgesics. Assuming that pain implies a regional dysfunction, headaches caused by sleep loss provide support for the notion that sleep has a restorative function in the brain.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Most cases of reflux event occur during the day, but reflux during sleep can cause not only esophageal problems, but also sleep problems, such as arousal and poor sleep quality. We report the case of a 17-year-old man who had been referred to us with frequent arousal following sudden dyspnea. On polysomnography, no respiratory disturbances and periodic limb movements were found during the sleep study, but frequent events of arousal were reported (arousal index: 12.3/h). On a 24-hr esophageal pH monitoring test, his DeMeester score was 176.43 and the total reflux time was 1120.9 min (76.9%), indicating the presence of significant acid reflux. After treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor, the arousals following nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue in the morning disappeared in the patient. GERD should be considered as a cause of spontaneous arousal or awakening not accompanying respiratory disturbances. Key words: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Arousal, Dyspnea, DeMeester",

      "abstract": "Obtaining a sufficient quantity and quality of sleep is important for good health. Chronic partial sleep deprivation, also known as insufficient sleep, is common in our society. The consequences include depressed mood, interpersonal irritability, decreased daytime vigilance, weight gain, coronary artery disease, and cognitive impairment (Kecklund and Axelsson 2016). Determining what amount of sleep is sufficient for an individual is difficult for several reasons. Sleep duration gradually decreases from a starting length of 16 hours per 24-hour day as human beings transition from infancy to adulthood. Interindividual differences in the optimal amount of sleep range from 6 to 12 hours, with a mean of 7.5 hours for adults. When a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (OSAH), is present, the continuity and depth of sleep may be compromised independently of sleep duration. Recognizing how much sleep any individual requires is complicated. Nonetheless, there is consensus that chronically inadequate sleep is detrimental to health.",

      "abstract": "For decades, neurologic and pulmonary disorders have been associated to diabetes mellitus (DM) and more recently to obesity. Many studies have attempted to establish the association between sleep apnea and adult-onset DM. Growing evidence exists demonstrating the association between insulin-resistance and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in non-obese diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. In patients with DM, two types of sleep disorders can be found; upper airway resistance syndrome and sleep apnea. The later apnea can be central, obstructive or mixed. In either case, a decrease in the oxygen saturation will ensue, and sleep arousal will occur. The diagnosis of sleep apnea in patients with DM is mainly done by obtaining a good history and physical examination. The main symptoms in the patient with sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness (frequently seen in situations which are not mentally demanding). Effective continued positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment show clinical improvement in symptoms as well as in insulin sensitivity. The relation between SDB and DM can have significant impact on the overall health of the patient. Keywords: Sleep apnea, sleep-related disorders, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, obesity",

A set of metrics can be computed by analysis of coupling and coherence of these signals, cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC). There are several forms of CPC, which may provide information about normal sleep physiology, and pathological sleep states ranging from insomnia to sleep apnea and hypertension. As CPC may be computed from reduced or limited signals such as the electrocardiogram or photoplethysmogram (PPG) vs. full polysomnography, wide application including in wearable and non-contact devices is possible. When computed from PPG, which may be acquired from oximetry alone, an automated apnea hypopnea index derived from CPC-oximetry can be calculated. Sleep profiling using CPC demonstrates the impact of stable and unstable sleep on insomnia (exaggerated variability), hypertension (unstable sleep as risk factor), improved glucose handling (associated with stable sleep), drug effects (benzodiazepines increase sleep stability), sleep apnea phenotypes (obstructive vs. central sleep apnea), sleep fragmentations due to psychiatric disorders (increased unstable sleep in depression).",

Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "abstract": "This critical review focuses on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its management from a dental medicine perspective. OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

      "title": "The Neuropharmacology of Sleep Disorders: Better Sleeping Through Chemistry?",
      "abstract": "Sleep and wake states involve interaction among many brain centers via multiple neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, hypocretin, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (wake promoting), and γ amino butyric acid (GABA) and melatonin (sleep promoting). Most medications for insomnia or hypersomnia act on elements of these neural systems. Initial treatment of insomnia includes sleep hygiene measures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is useful. Medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for insomnia act on GABA receptors or on melatonin receptors. A frequent cause of insomnia is restless legs syndrome, which is linked to reduced dopaminergic activity in brain structures; idiopathic restless legs syndrome is best treated with dopamine agonists such as ropinerole or pramipexole. Excessive daytime sleepiness is most often due to insufficient sleep hours or sleep apnea but is also caused by medications, illnesses, narcolepsy, or idiopathic hypersomnia. Stimulants generally act through enhanced dopamine action (amphetamines, methylphenidate) or acetylcholine action (caffeine). Modafinil may act through enhanced central histamine, hypocretin, and possibly dopamine action. A newer agent, γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), acts on GABA and GHB receptors to consolidate sleep, improving daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Improving knowledge of sleep/wake mechanisms should lead to more specific and rational treatments for sleep disorders.",

People who suffer from insomnia may be unsatisfied with their sleep and exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: weariness, low energy, problems concentrating, mood swings, and poor work performance. Insomnia can be classified based on how long it lasts. Acute insomnia is a type of insomnia that lasts only a few hours and is caused by a variety of factors. Many people have had this form of temporary sleep disruption, which usually goes away without medication. Chronic insomnia is defined as sleep disruption that lasts at least three months and occurs at least three evenings per week. Insomnia can be caused by a variety of factors. Insomnia is caused by a misalignment of sleep-inducing neurotransmitters. The Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index are two methodologies and indices that have been used to research sleep disturbances in insomnia sufferers. Many medicines, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines, are used in the treatment, and drinking Melatonin-rich milk has also been found to be useful.",

Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). While they may be dismissed as \"bad dreams,\" nightmares may be indicative of another disorder occurring in sleep. Nightmares are part of a category of sleep disorders referred to as parasomnias—\"undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep\" (American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd ed. Darien, IL: American Academy of Sleep Medicine; 2014). Parasomnias are categorized by the stage of sleep in which they occur: NREM sleep—typically observed in the first half of the night, versus REM sleep—associated with the latter half of the sleep period. NREM parasomnias are also referred to as \"disorders of arousal\" and include sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and confusional arousals. REM sleep parasomnias include REM behavior disorder (RBD) and nightmares (dreams with negative content that may cause awakening). It is important to identify what kind of parasomnia the \"nightmare\" represents, as there may be serious consequences such as injury to ones' self or others that can occur. Additionally, as in the case of RBD, it may be a potential sign of another neurodegenerative process, such as parkinsonism. Polysomnogram is often utilized in the evaluation of parasomnias and can also be helpful to exclude other disorders, which may mimic these conditions.",

In layman’s terms inadequate sleep is the likely reason but as responsible oral health care professionals interpreting in terms of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS), is a sensible approach. EDS is not a disease rather it’s a serious symptom linked with various disorders. It’s alarming that around 42 million people are victims of sleeping disorder in United States.1 Potential causes include Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), insomnia, narcolepsy, sedatives, psychiatric disorders and restless leg syndrome. OSA is claimed as the most common reason of EDS. OSA candidate present difficulty in breathing owing to defective pharyngeal dilator muscles that eventually obstruct the upper airways (UA). Blockage of airflow enforces them to wake up in night and wherein the patients are not aware of the constant arousals. Irregularity in breathing and deprived sleep leads them to be categorized as ‘sleepy patients’. Press reports have revealed that people in Malaysia are able to afford only 6.4 hours of sleep per 24 h, which considerably affects their routine activity.2 It is sad to know that 10-20% of male adults and 7-9% of children of Malaysian population is victims of sleeping disorder.3 Though commonly seen in the middle-aged adults and obese candidates, mutually the male and female genders are affected.

A woman's sleep may be interrupted by issues related to her menstrual cycle, such as fatigue and sleepiness in those with premenstrual syndrome. Pregnancy may lead to or worsen restless legs syndrome and/or obstructive sleep apnea and the hormonal changes during menopause may cause insomnia or other sleep complaints. Awareness of sleep disorders in women, who often have unique clinical presentations, should be increased and addressed.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Studies of Sleep Disturbances in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Purpose of Review: Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent longitudinal studies of sleep in PD have utilized validated sleep questionnaires and video-polysomnography performed over multiple time points. This review summarizes existing longitudinal studies focusing on the prevalence, associations, and changes of sleep disorders in PD over time, as well as the methodologies used in these studies. Recent Findings: Fifty-three longitudinal studies of sleep in PD were identified: excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless legs syndrome, and shift work disorder were studied in addition to other studies that had focused on either multiple sleep disorders or broadly on sleep disorders as a whole. The prevalence of sleep disorders increases over time and are associated particularly with non-motor features of disease. RBD is now considered an established prodromal feature of PD, but other sleep disorders do not clearly increase risk of subsequent PD. Further work is necessary to determine if treatment of sleep disorders in PD alters disease symptom and their progression or reduces PD risk. Summary: Longitudinal studies of sleep in PD have demonstrated a high prevalence of sleep disorders that are associated with non-motor features of PD which can increase over time. More work is necessary to determine if treatment of sleep disorders can alter the course of PD.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia defined by intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia during REM sleep with emergence of complex and vigorous behaviors. Punching, kicking, and leaping from bed during attempted dream enactment caused repeated injury in nine of our first ten adult patients. Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male. All patients underwent standard polysomnographic studies with videotaping of behaviors and extensive neurologic and psychiatric evaluations. The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep. Eight patients had dream changes involving motor overactivity and violent confrontations of dream characters. Clonazepam induced rapid and sustained improvement of dream and sleep behavior problems in seven patients, as did desipramine hydrochloride in one patient. (<i>JAMA</i>1987;257:1786-1789)",

While the focus is usually placed on symptoms related to hypogonadism, such as infertility, recent studies have noted evidence of poor sleep in those patients.We report on the case of a 44-year-old man with KS who consulted in our Sleep medicine center for excessive daytime sleepiness and delayed sleep with irregular patterns. Polysomnography (PSG) revealed sleep apnea syndrome, with both obstructive and central apnea. Peripheral temperature monitoring revealed patterns indicative of altered melatonin secretion. The present case report suggests that sleep disturbance in patients with KS appears multifactorial with the occurrence of: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), iatrogenic central apnea due to testosterone therapy, and circadian sleep/wake disorder.While this topic warrants larger studies with control groups, this case report suggests there might be specific sleep impairments, associated with three different mechanisms, in patients with KS. Those sleep disorders can worsen psycho-social and cognitive difficulties in those patients, and should therefore be screened for and treated.",

      "abstract": "La relación entre epilepsia y sueño ha sido descrita desde hace más de dos mil años. Es así como Aristóteles en “Sobre el Sueño y la Vigilia” describe “tanto el sueño como la epilepsia atacan, y en ese sentido el sueño es una crisis. Consecuentemente en muchos casos la epilepsia comienza en el sueño y hay hombres que convulsionan durante el sueño pero no cuando están despiertos”. En tanto Hipócrates menciona en uno de sus aforismos “miedos, furia, delirio, saltos de la cama y convulsiones durante la noche”. Esta interrelación es recíproca, múltiple y compleja. Incluye dificultades diagnósticas semiológicas entre epilepsia y parasomnias, impacto de algunos trastornos del sueño en el control de la epilepsia, relación del ciclo sueño-vigilia con la aparición de crisis, efecto del sueño en la morfología de las descargas epileptiformes, fragmentación del sueño por crisis nocturnas frecuentes, efectos de la privación de sueño sobre la epilepsia y su rol como activador de descargas epileptiforme y crisis, efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos en el nivel de vigilancia diurna y en la calidad del sueño nocturno, etc. The relation between sleep and epilepsy is complex and known since ancient times. During NonREM there are several physiological changes which have neuronal synchronization as substrate; during REM the tendency is the opposite. This explains why during Non REM sleep interictal discharges and seizures can increase. Also, there are several parasomnias that can be confused with epileptic seizures, including periodic limb movement disorder, REM sleep behaviour disorder, nightmares, etc. Other sleep disorders have clinical features that can be taking as seizures (i.e. cataplectic attacks) or can worsen the epilepsies (Sleep Apnea Syndrome). On the other hand some epileptic syndromes have mainly or exclusively nocturnal seizures and others show awakening related seizures. Finally, epilepsy also impact negatively sleep architecture, through several possible mechanisms, including effect of the disease per se o via antiepileptic drug effects.",

      "abstract": "Background Insomnia is a highly prevalent complaint, largely associated with mental disease. Clinical evidence classifies insomnia in 2 subtypes: with sleep misperception (WSM) and without sleep misperception (wSM). That presents distinctive pathophysiologic pathways and different public health implications. Objectives Describe the main differences between primary insomnia WSM and wSM regarding: – clinical features; – diagnosis; – management; – implications. Methods We conducted a systematic review. PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo were searched from 2000–2016. The reference lists of systematic reviews, narrative synthesis and some important articles were included. Following the inclusion criteria, we selected 25 studies from 59 articles. Results The prevalence of sleep-state misperception in primary insomniacs (total sleep time &gt; 6.5 h and sleep efficiency &gt; 85%) is around 26%. Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder. Cortical hyperarousal is higher in insomniacs and could be related to an alteration in sleep protection mechanisms. The sleep architecture was relatively normal for the WSM comparing with the group wSM. Risk of cardiometabolic, neurocognitive morbidity and mortality, and responses to treatment are different between these two insomnia phenotypes. Patients with short sleep duration may respond better to biological treatments, whereas insomnia with normal sleep duration may respond primarily to psychological therapies. Conclusions The clinical characteristics of patients with sleep-state misperception differed from those without this condition. Available research related to these conditions is expanding rapidly, but many questions remain unanswered.

Pitru grahonmada (PG) is one among 18 types of bhutonmada or grahonmada, and it is caused by affliction of \"pitru graha\" (an evil spirit or super natural power or extraterrestrial force or an idiopathic factor).

The aim and objective of the present study is to explore PG with the help of contemporary psychiatric literature. Ayurvedic literature related to PG has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and from their commentaries. PG is characterized by features such as \"Aprasanna drishtim and Apashyantam\" (vision loss or abnormalities), \"Chala netra pakshmaanaam\" (abnormal eye movements), \"Shankitekshanam\" (suspicious looks), \"Apasavya vastram\" (confusion or memory loss or disorientation), \"Deena vadanam\" (depression), \"Anannabhilasha or Arochaka or Avipaaka or Alpaagni or Manda paavaka\" (various gastrointestinal tract abnormalities), \"Pratihata vaacham or Skhalat vaacham\" (speech abnormalities), \"Nidraalu\" (excessive sleepiness), \"Samsushka taalukam\" (oral manifestations of Vitamin B12 deficiency), \"Shaantaatma\" (catatonia or depression or reduced psycho-motor activity) and \"Tila, guda, maamsa, and paayasa priyam\" (cravings for sugar and meat).

      "abstract": "A widespread network of respiratory-related neurons within the brainstem controls the regular respiratory cycle, which is dependent upon unspecific and specific drives like hypoxia or hypercapnia. This respiratory network and its respiratory drives are subjects to typical changes during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and within the various sleep states, which favor a destabilization of breathing during sleep. There is also a respiratory-related innervation of the dilating and stiffening pharyngeal muscles as well as a local reflex control of the basic tone of upper airway muscles, both of which are influenced by the different states of wakefulness and sleep. These sleep-related changes cause an increase in upper airway resistance during sleep. In healthy subjects, however, these features during sleep are almost completely compensated and the gas exchange is hardly hindered. However, in the case of illness, severe disordered breathing, disturbed gas exchange and interrupted sleep may occur. The central hypoventilation syndrome, central apnea-hypopnea syndromes, as well as the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome belong to these diseases. Because of the intense research, we have a detailed picture of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the origin and the maintenance of sleep-related breathing disorders.",

However, other abnormal movements can emerge during sleep, either as a primary phenomenon or in association with another underlying movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, some movement disorders are associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia. A history from the patient's bed-partner is very helpful in the assessment of movement disorders during sleep. The patient themself may not be aware of the problem, and may simply report excessive daytime sleepiness because of poor quality of sleep. Movement disorders during sleep are often a very early symptom of another underlying movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, but may be overlooked unless specific enquiry is made during history taking. Table 12.1 lists causes of movement disorders which occur during sleep, and movement disorders which may be associated with sleep disturbance.",

Les procedures d’activation visent a augmenter cette sensibilite, en suscitant la survenue d’anomalies EEG specifiques ou d’evenements cliniques pertinents. La privation de sommeil prealable au recueil d’un EEG prolonge est l’une des techniques d’activation les plus utilisees. Cet article presente une revue des donnees publiees, et les resultats d’une enquete portant sur les pratiques en France. Dans notre service, nous avons montre que le moment de realisation de l’EEG prolonge apres privation de sommeil (matin ou apres-midi) n’influencait pas la rentabilite (y compris en terme d’obtention d’une activite de sommeil) et que, dans l’exploration de malaises suspects (epileptiques ou psychogenes), la rentabilite diagnostique dans une etude prospective avoisinait 55 %. Il est propose de faire converger les pratiques vers des procedures consensuelles, d’autant plus necessaires dans le contexte actuel de codification croissante des actes medicaux.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

The presence of cataplexy is strongly associated with a deficiency of the neuropeptide hypocretin.

Furthermore, shortened REM latency (less than or equal to 65.0 min) was observed with significantly more frequency in depressed PD patients (6 out of 8) compared to nondepressed PD patients (4 out of 18, p less than 0.02). The other sleep parameters studied did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients.

      "title": "Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in patients with narcolepsy is associated with hypocretin-1 deficiency",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is characterized by dream-enacting behaviour and impaired motor inhibition during rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but also reported in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Most narcolepsy with cataplexy patients lack the sleep–wake, and rapid eye movement sleep, motor-regulating hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and hypocretin deficiency are rare in narcolepsy without cataplexy. We hypothesized that rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder coexists with cataplexy in narcolepsy due to hypocretin deficiency. In our study, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder was diagnosed by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2nd edition) criteria in 63 narcolepsy patients with or without cataplexy. Main outcome measures were: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms; short and long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep; and periodic and non-periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Outcome variables were analysed in relation to cataplexy and hypocretin deficiency with uni- and multivariate logistic/linear regression models, controlling for possible rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder biasing factors (age, gender, disease duration, previous anti-cataplexy medication). Only hypocretin deficiency independently predicted rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms (relative risk = 3.69, P = 0.03), long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 0.81, P < 0.01), and short muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 1.01, P < 0.01). Likewise, periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep were only associated with hypocretin deficiency (P < 0.01). A significant association between hypocretin deficiency and cataplexy was confirmed (P < 0.01). In a sub-analysis, hypocretin deficiency suggested the association of periodic limb movements and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder outcomes (symptoms, non-periodic short and long muscle activity) in rapid eye movement sleep. Our results support the hypothesis that hypocretin deficiency is independently associated with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in narcolepsy. Thus, hypocretin deficiency is linked to the two major disturbances of rapid eye movement sleep motor regulation in narcolepsy: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and cataplexy. Hypocretin deficiency is also significantly associated with periodic limb movements in rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep, and provides a possible pathophysiological link between rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and periodic limb movements in narcolepsy. The study supports the hypothesis that an impaired hypocretin system causes a general instability of motor regulation during wakefulness, rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep in human narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "Drivers' sleepiness and falling asleep while driving account for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents (studies show different results from 1% to 30%). Sleepiness is rarely well recognised as a causing factor of traffic accidents. 2.5% up to 20% people suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with sleep deprivation as its most frequent cause. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and medical problems--especially sleep disturbances. The sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) has been identified as the most common cause of habitual drowsy driving. Patients with SAS (apart from other health problems) are 6 times more likely to have accidents. After adequate treatment of severe SAS with continuous positive airway pressure the risk of accident lowered 5 x. Other important sleep disturbances include chronic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement in sleep. Sleepiness was described in Parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy, in chronic cardiacs and in people with complex internal health problems. Regular or single intake of drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others) can itself induce sleep problems. Sleepiness in persons without sleep disorder may occur due to preventable causes such as poor sleep habits which lead to sleep deprivation.",

The most prevalent sleep disorder, insomnia, includes difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, waking up too early, and non-restorative or poor quality sleep. Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Sleep disturbances in palliative care can be due to either the advanced disease and/or its treatment. Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, as well as environmental factors, can also present contributing factors.

      "title": "Sleep-Promoting Material Extracted from Peritoneal Dialysate of Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease and Insomnia",
      "abstract": "We studied four patients with end stage renal disease treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) who complained of chronic insomnia and fatigue. Overnight polysomnography showed a disorder of sleep maintenance that was associated with nocturnal myoclonus. Sleeppromoting substance(s), Factor S-like material, that was extracted from the patient's dialysate effluent, was somnogenic and pyrogenic in a rabbit bioassay. Another proposed sleep substance, lnterleukin -I, isolated by gel filtration, also was present in the dialysate effluents of all patients. Altered metabolism and/or loss of these substances from the effluent may contribute to the chronic insomnia and fatigue of CAPD patients. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are restored to medical “health” by dialysis, but commonly they complain of depression, fatigue, and insomnia. Profound sleep disturbances have been described (1–4) and are associated with nocturnal myoclonus (5). These sleep-related, periodic, involuntary leg movements occur at intervals of 20 to 40 sec and disrupt the continuity of sleep (6). In their review of sleep-wakefulness disorders associated with nocturnal myoclonus Coleman et al (7), suggest that a chronic sleep-wake disturbance may lead to these periodic movements during sleep rather than the converse. However, the physiologic mechanism for the involuntary leg movements during sleep remains unknown. Endogenous substances that promote sleep -neuromodulators, hypnotoxins have been investigated for many years (8). One of these, Factor S, has been extracted from human urine (9) and rabbit brain (10). Factor S derived from urine has been identified as a muramyl tetrapeptide with a molecular size of 922 daltons (11). Picomole quantities of this substance administered intracerebroventricularly were sufficient to induce excess slow-wave sleep (SWS) in rabbits for 6 or more hours (11). Some chemical analogues to Factor S, such as NAc-Mur-L-ala-D-isogln -a synthetic adjuvant called muramyl dipeptide or MDP, also were found to be somnogenic (12, 13). MDP and other related muramyl peptides also are pyrogenic and immunostimulatory (14). These responses could be elicited either directly by these synthetic compounds or through the leukocytic monokine interleukin-l (IL-l) (15), whose synthesis and release can be stimulated by muramyl peptides (16). IL-l, a polypeptide of about 15,000 daltons (17, 18), has the capacity to promote SWS (19). Recently IL-l has been demonstrated in astrocytes exposed to endotoxin (20). Thus astrocyte-derived IL-l may mediate certain brain functions, such as sleep. This paper will show that the sleep physiology of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is severely disrupted with noctumal myoclonus, i.e., sleep-related, involuntary, periodic leg movements. Further, dialysis fluids obtained from these patients contain a Factor S-like material and IL-l. It is possible that, in ESRD patients, altered metabolism and/or loss of the above-mentioned sleep-promoting substances may contribute to chronic insomnia and daytime fatigue.",

In the hypercapnic group, they have an already blunted respiratory drive that is further reduced during sleep, resulting in central sleep apnea usually from syndromes such as central alveolar hypoventilation or neuromuscular weakness. In the nonhypercapnic group, central sleep apnea is induced when arterial PaCO2 levels are below the PaCO2 apnea threshold, leading to cessation in ventilatory effort, which can occur in such disorders as congestive heart failure (CHF), neurological diseases, and high-altitude periodic breathing (1). But it may also be seen in the absence of any underlying medical illness, which is called idiopathic central sleep apnea or primary central sleep apnea (1,3).",

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet well understood [2] and require future research to inform developments in the diagnosis and treatment (or management) of the disorder. The aim of this letter is to facilitate such work by highlighting recent findings and proposing a new nomenclature to become standard practice for describing this phenomenon. Insomnia is regarded as a “subjective” disorder, for which individuals’ perceptions of sleep and daytime functioning form the basis of its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. However, objective measurements of sleep may also hold an important role. Clinicians have anecdotally reported that discussing the discrepancy between perceived and objectively measured sleep can be therapeutic. Preliminary findings [10] support this anecdotal evidence, suggesting that personalized feedback about the discrepancy between self-report (sleep diary) and objectively measured (actigraphy) sleep reduced the discrepancy on subsequent nights in a group of 40 individuals with insomnia when compared to those who received no feedback [10]. However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon and the implications for the diagnosis and management of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, waking up at night to urinate, is a highly prevalent disorder in the elderly with a profound impact on life expectancy, health and quality of life. It interacts negatively with sleep and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness. In particular, waking up three or more times a night to void is related to a steep increase in sleep disturbances. Giddiness, both at night and during the day, is another common consequence, since in three out of four cases, nocturia can be attributed to nocturnal urine overproduction, causing a negative fluid balance. Fall injuries are the most important risk associated with nocturia. Nocturia may be attributable not only to nocturnal polyuria, but also to a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Treatment may include diuretics (taken in the afternoon instead of in the morning), vasopressin analogs (desmopressin) at bedtime or antimuscarinic drugs to improve nocturnal bladder capacity.",

Patients with sleep disorders often benefit from a general medical evaluation to investigate contributing factors. Fatigue and sleepiness may be associated with endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. The major symptom of Insomnia Disorder is dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep. Insomnia is associated with a wide variety of medical disorders, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorder.

The duration of the central events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation were both maximum at the beginning of each run and became progressively less prominent with the development of the sequences. Night episodes disappeared with bedtime clonazepam but behavioral problems occurred as a paradoxical response; thus, clonazepam was stopped. Sleep extension and melatonin were then started, which were followed by a reduction of night episode frequency and intensity. This observation appears to be the first report of central sleep apnea sequences triggered by parasomnia and, if confirmed by additional reports, it might be considered to be a possible new classification of \"complex parasomnia.\"",

We researched sleep habits and disturbances, as well as the consumption of hypnotics. We found that both groups had similar habits, although those with PD altered according to the stage of development of the disease, thus difficulty in staying sleep and parasomnia were more frequent in PD sufferers and worsened in the most advanced cases. On the other hand the quality of night sleep and the consumption of hypnotics interfered in the daytime efficiency of those suffering from Parkinson's Disease.",

REM sleep is often called dreaming (or D) sleep, because dreams are reported by about 70–80% of persons awakened during this period. REM sleep also is referred to as paradoxical sleep, because the brain paradoxically seems to be in an activated state that is similar to, but not identical to, the waking state. REM sleep is characterized by an activated electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (low‐voltage, fast‐frequency brain waves), muscular paralysis (with the exception of diaphragmatic and ocular muscles), periodic bursts of rapid eye movements, and autonomic nervous system instability (e.g., variable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration). Brain metabolism is normal or slightly increased during REM sleep.",

A peculiar phase other than p. p can be seen in human natural sleep, . which might be called reverse paradoxical phase (r. p. p), for the relation between EEG pattern and the activity level of many other physiological. functions is the reverse of that in p. p.2. P. p and r. p. p are two different manifestations of the dissociation between EEG and many other physiological activities, especially vegetative functions.3. The fact that p. p is apt to appear at the end of each single sleep cycleand r. p. p comes at the beginning or in the middle of each single sleep cycle could account for the phasic shift of changes in EEG and other physiological functions.4. The prominent occurrence of p. p in the latter half and r. p. p in the first half of the natural night sleep could be attributed to the difference in distribution pattern of activity level of each physiological function. For instance, more occurence of EEG III can be seen in the earlier period of the night sleep, while the depressed or minor activity of GSR, blood pressure is distributed more in the latter half of the night sleep.",

Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Primary insomnias develop due to the hyperarousal condition and sleep preventing practices. Diagnosis of the secondary insomnia is always difficult because the presence of the temporarily association between the causative disease and sleep disorder needs to be confirmed. Along with the general principles of treatment for the primary and secondary insomnia, the specific treatment modalities exist. It could be the correction of the primary disease or special techniques for the separate form of insomnia. From the sleep-related breathing disturbances the most common and clinically important form is the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. There are adult and pediatric forms of this disorder. Primary or secondary origin of these syndromes is discussed, but the most effective treatment by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is nonspecific.

      "title": "Syndrome of Transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL): A Case Report - Is there an Association with the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "abstract": "Bartleson, 1981 described the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL) for the first time.[1] HaNDL is classified as a \"headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorder\" and is included in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders.[2] HaNDL, a rare clinical entity, is diagnosed according to the following criteria: (1) episodes of migraine-like headache; (2) accompanied or shortly preceded by the onset of at least one transient neurological deficit lasting >4 h, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (>15 white cells/mL), with negative etiological studies; (3) development or significant worsening of headache and transient neurological deficits in temporal relation to the onset or worsening of the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis or led to its discovery, and/or have significantly improved in parallel with the improvement in the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; and (4) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. The syndrome resolves within 3 months.[2] Although the etiology of HaNDL is not precisely known, based on CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, it is assumed to be associated with an autoimmune or infectious inflammatory disease. Cortical spreading depression may also cause neurologic deficits.[3] CSF lymphocytosis may be accompanied by elevated CSF total protein and CSF pressure that supports possible inflammation. Electroencephalography (EEG) may demonstrate focally abnormal areas consistent with focal neurological deficits. The neurological manifestations include sensory symptoms in approximately three-quarters, aphasia in two-thirds, and motor deficits in a little more than half of the cases.[2] Neurologic adverse events such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are generally mild and transient. One of the most frequent neurological complaints reported after the COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Twenty-eight-year-old female patient with migraine reported to our outpatient clinic with severe headache, speech disturbances, and right-sided sensory symptoms. She had a throbbing pain localized to the left hemisphere, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The migraine attacks occurred once every 2 months and were responsive to simple analgesics. After the second dose of COVID-19 (BNT162b2-BioNTech) vaccination, the frequency and character of headache attacks changed. Distinct severe headaches were noted, and the frequency of headache attacks was increased to 15 days a month with a significantly reduced analgesic response. After 2 months of vaccination, severe headache attacks became chronic and right-sided hemi-hypesthesia and dysarthria appeared. There was no recent viral disease history except for the COVID-19 infection 8 months back during which she had mild symptoms. There was a minimal increase in the frequency of headaches without any change in character. However, dramatic changes occurred post-vaccination. Neurologic examination revealed mild dysarthria, and right hemi-hypesthesia with normoactive tendon reflexes, without any motor disturbance, neck stiffness, meningeal irritation signs, pathological reflexes, or cognitive dysfunction. A detailed blood work-up was performed, including vitamin B12 levels, and serological tests, all of which were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was weakly positive (1/100) in the vasculitis panel. Detailed autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody panels were all negative. Ophthalmological examination revealed no papilledema. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-contrast computerized tomography (CT), MR angiography (MRA), venography, and EEG were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed leukocytic pleocytosis with lymphocytic dominance (45 leukocytes-80% lymphocytes without erythrocytes). CSF opening pressure was 10 cm/CSF and analysis revealed normal protein (40 mg/dL) and normal glucose levels (61 mg/dL-serum: 79 mg/dL). The CSF viral panel, Gram stain, and culture were negative. After the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, HaNDL secondary to the COVID-19 vaccination was diagnosed and was followed closely with symptomatic treatment. The patient's clinical symptoms lasted for approximately 3 weeks and then disappeared spontaneously. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of neurologic deficits despite the occasional headache. There are different views on the etiology of HaNDL syndrome. The presence of inflammatory CSF findings suggests that infection and/or inflammation triggers the condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that viral infection may activate the immune system and cause HaNDL syndrome.[4] The most important finding in support of this hypothesis is that some patients had a viral infection before the onset of symptoms.[5] After infection with COVID-19, persistent or new symptoms may develop for weeks or months, called long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. The symptoms may exceed 12 weeks. Common symptoms in people with long COVID are fatigue, headache, breathlessness, cough, chest pain, myalgia and weakness, insomnia, memory and concentration problems, and worsened quality of life.[6] Although the frequency of the patient's headache increased post-COVID-19 infection, it was vaccine-related rather than infection since the main change in headache character was post-vaccination. A known adverse event of COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Patients with migraine-type headaches develop more headaches after COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls.[7] In BNT162b2 clinical trials (manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer), a higher incidence of headache was noted after the second dose than the first dose, with approximately 52% of patients reporting mild to moderate headaches.[8] In accordance with the literature data, headaches increased in our patients with a history of migraine, particularly after the second vaccination dose. Studies emphasize that the risk of headache after vaccination is increased twice and has a migrainous character in one-third of patients. Although the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced headaches are still unclear, it may be owing to a systemic inflammatory response.[9] Vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA may cause an immunomodulatory response. The immune system stimulation following vaccination induces a strong T-cell response and increases CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.[10] Although the neurological deficit developed in our patient 2 months after the vaccination, there was a significant and constant change in the frequency and character of the headaches immediately post-vaccination. Therefore, the neurological deficit added 2 months later was considered a continuation. In light of all these data and after excluding other differential diagnoses, the COVID-19 vaccination may be considered as a possible cause of HaNDL syndrome by triggering inflammation in our patient. HaNDL should be considered in the differential diagnosis after excluding other probable causes in patients with neurological deficits and headaches post-COVID-19 vaccination.

      "abstract": "All-night EEG records were obtained in 100 patients aged 14-48 years staying at a neurosurgical centre for various forms of focal epilepsy. In 84 cases discharges were observed during the nocturnal investigation. The morphology of the discharges depended on the phase of sleep during which they appeared. Discharges occurring in phases of light sleep had greater activity and more focal character in relation to the remaining NREM phases. On the other hand, discharges in deep sleep phases had a greater tendency for generalization. In half the cases focal discharges disappeared in the REM sleep phase. Intraseizure changes depended on the phase of sleep, focal or generalized character, and localization of pathological focus. Seiture activity during sleep was never observed in the REM phase of sleep.",

      "abstract": "Background: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a relatively common mitochondrial disorder. In addition to extraocular muscle weakness, various other organs can typically be affected, including laryngeal and limb muscles, cerebrum, cerebellum, and peripheral nerves. Given this multi‐organ involvement, patients are likely to be prone to sleep disturbances. Here, we determined the nature, prevalence, and determinants of sleep disturbances in CPEO. Methods: We used validated questionnaires for various sleep disorders and possible determinants such as mood and anxiety, and we performed ambulant polysomnography (PSG) in 20 patients with genetically confirmed CPEO. Results: Three quarters of patients reported nocturnal sleep dysfunction. Thirty‐five percent of patients fulfilled the criteria for restless legs syndrome, 30% excessive daytime sleepiness, and 70% significant periodic limb movements. PSG recordings revealed several indicators of a disrupted sleep architecture. Obstructive sleep disordered breathing was present in only one patient. However, four patients had an increased central sleep apnea index, all of whom had a polymerase gamma‐1 mutation and a SANDO phenotype (sensoric atactic neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia). Physical examination and questionnaire outcomes were poor predictors of PSG results. Conclusion: Several specific sleep disturbances are part of the phenotype of CPEO. Given that the disease is otherwise incurable, symptomatic treatment of sleep disturbances may be an important tool to improve quality of life. Therefore, patients with CPEO should be actively screened for sleep disorders, with a low threshold to perform PSG.",

      "abstract": "Background and purpose: Sleep disorders are increasingly implicated as risk factors for stroke, as well as a determinant of stroke outcome. They can also occur secondary to the stroke itself. In this review, we describe the variety of different sleep disorders associated with stroke and analyze their effect on stroke risk and outcome. Methods: A search term-based literature review (“sleep,” “insomnia,” “narcolepsy,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements during sleep,” “excessive daytime sleepiness” AND “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” in PubMed; “stroke” and “sleep” in ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed. English articles from 1990 to March 2023 were considered. Results: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke. In addition, sleep disturbance has been reported in half of all stroke sufferers; specifically, an increase is not only sleep-related breathing disorders but also periodic limb movements during sleep, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, sleep duration, and circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders. Poststroke sleep disturbance has been associated with worse outcome. Conclusion: Sleep disorders are risk factors for stroke and associated with worse stroke outcome. They are also a common consequence of stroke. Recent guidelines suggest screening for sleep disorders after stroke. It is possible that treatment of sleep disorders could both reduce stroke risk and improve stroke outcome, although further data from clinical trials are required.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most common autosomal recessive ataxia. This disorder is associated with progressive development of sensory and cerebellar ataxia, along with cardiomyopathy and scoliosis. In the pediatric population, FA can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypoventilation; REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is not well described in the pediatric literature. A 16 year old male with a history of FA, cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, and severe OSA treated with Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) therapy presented to the pediatric home ventilator clinic with symptoms of daytime fatigue and hypersomnolence with reported inability to tolerate bilevel PAP therapy with spontaneous –timed mode. By parent report, he consistently took off his mask at night after 2–3 hours of use, had vocalizations and excessive movements during sleep. Given concern for intolerance to NIPPV or suboptimal treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, the patient underwent a retitration polysomnogram (PSG) resulting in the initiation of Pressure Control / Average Volume Assured Pressure Support (PC/AVAPS) therapy. Notably, the patient was also seen on PSG to remove his mask several times during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep resulting in frequent awakenings and sleep fragmentation. The patient was sent to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders and was diagnosed with REM sleep behavior disorder. The patient was trialed on melatonin, both 5 and 10 mg, without benefit. He was then started on clonazepam with titration up to 1 mg at bedtime which effectively controlled his nocturnal movements. On clonazepam, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in compliance with NIPPV therapy and improvement in both daytime fatigue and hypersomnolence. Pediatric patients with Friedreich's Ataxia have high risk for OSA and hypoventilation often requiring NIPPV. In this population, RBD, although rare, should be considered as a potential cause for the NIPPV non-adherence.",

SRVAs typically involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle, with no braking beforehand. Because of a high impact speed these accidents are often serious. SRVAs peak around 02:00h-06:00h and 14:00h-16:00h, when daily sleepiness is naturally higher. Hence, time of day is a critical factor, as important as the duration of the drive. Most SRVAs are not due to sleep pathology. Many are work-related. Non-sleeping rest is no substitute for sleep. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning, and is preceded by feelings of increasing sleepiness of which drivers are quite aware. Driving impairment is usually worse than is realised by the sleepy driver. The best countermeasure is sleep, or even a short nap. Even more effective is the combination of a nap with caffeine.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "This study describes the clinical features, natural history and treatment of 100 patients with narcolepsy. Over half had one or more affected relatives. Symptoms commenced in adolescence or early adult life in most patients, and remissions were uncommon. Narcolepsy occurred several times each day, often in unusual circumstances and sometimes with little warning. The mean total sleep time of narcoleptics was a little over 9 hours in each 24 hour period, as compared with under 8 in normal subjects. Cataplexy occurred in 93 patients, most commonly when subjects were tired. Attacks were similar in nature to physiological weakness with laughter, although other sudden sensory or emotional stimuli did not cause paralysis of voluntary movement nor loss of muscle tone in normal subjects. Half these patients had frequent dreams before the onset of proper sleep, and 62 had sleep paralysis. This was often frightening, with feelings of suffocation, accompanied by dreams, and of uncertain length. A minority of patients with narcolepsy had muscle aches and jerks before sleep, double vision or loss of focus during cataplexy, went sleep-walking by day, and had daytime hallucinations. Amphetamines had been given to 71 patients for periods of up to 33 years with adequate, but rarely complete, control of narcolepsy. Side effects were common and almost half these patients became tolerant, needing higher dosage to control symptoms. Three patients had a cerebrovascular accident whilst taking amphetamines. Imipramine or clomipramine had ben given in combination with amphetamines to 33 patients for periods of up to 6 years with considerable improvement in both cataplexy and sleep paralysis, and few side effects. Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension as a result of amphetamines or combined treatment did not occur.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common and affect sleep quality and quantity, leading to increased morbidity. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized as those who cannot sleep, those who will not sleep, those with excessive daytime sleepiness, and those with increased movements during sleep. Insomnia, defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in daytime impairment, is diagnosed using history findings and treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without sleep hypnotics. Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an urge to move the legs that worsens with rest, is relieved by movement, and often occurs in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome is treated based on the frequency of symptoms. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. It is diagnosed using a sleep log or actigraphy, followed by overnight polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, such as modafinil; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate). Patients with snoring and witnessed apneas may have obstructive sleep apnea, which is diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Continuous positive airway pressure is the most common and effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in the patient acting out dreams with possible harmful consequences. It is diagnosed based on history and polysomnography findings, and treated with environmental safety measures and melatonin or clonazepam.",

      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology and treatment of enuresis: Focus on sleep",
      "abstract": "Currently, nocturnal polyuria as a result of desmopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal threshold is considered to be central to the pathogenesis of enuresis.1 The sleep of enuretic children might be deep, but possibly disturbed (by obstructed airways or by a distended or contracting bladder). Because both detrusor contractions and bladder distension are recognized as strong arousal stimuli,2 many investigators have speculated that there must be something amiss with the enuretic children's arousal mechanisms.1 A striking report came from Yeung et al., who demonstrated, using polysomnography and continuous cystometry, that the signals from an overactive bladder cause increased arousal during sleep, and that the sleep of enuretic children might in fact be disturbed by frequent, inefficient arousal reactions (an interaction between bladder overactivity and cortical arousability: a “bladder–brain dialogue”).3 They suggested that the transition from light sleep to awakening was suppressed by long-term overstimulation by signals from the bladder to the brain. Further studies had not been reported until Dhondt et al. found, using video-polysomnography, concomitant increased sleep fragmentation and abnormally increased “periodic limb movements” during sleep in treatment-resistant enuresis.4 In this issue of the Journal, Tsuji et al. report lower sleep efficiency assessed using a novel contactless biomotion sensor in enuretic children, and that this remained unchanged after successful treatment with enuresis alarm,5 although we might take into consideration the possibility that the Tsuji et al. patients were not polyuric at night-time (because those patients were treated with alarm, not by desmopressin). Recently, the Japanese Society on Enuresis issued clinical guidelines in which they proposed first-line therapy for monosymptomatic enuresis consisting of desmopressin and enuresis alarm,6 in accordance with the recommendation from the International Children's Continence Society.7 Desmopressin diminishes nocturnal polyuria, and the alarm can be presumed to act on sleep and arousal, but whether this occurs through some form of conditioning or resetting of the arousal thresholds is unclear.1 Nearly 15–20% of patients do not respond to the first-line therapy, and additional treatment involving anticholinergics or antidepressants is proposed for them. Anticholinergics can decrease detrusor overactivity, whereas antidepressants presumably have multiple noradrenergic and serotoninergic effects, acting on the central nervous system and/or the bladder.1 Still some enuretic patients are refractory to this second- or third-line treatment. Several preliminary anti-enuretic results have been reported recently for the following medications, which modulate the sleep condition of enuretic patients: melatonin,8-10 clonidine,11 and yokukansan.12 To clarify the mechanisms by which these drugs have a beneficial effect on enuresis, additional studies on patient sleep states using up-to-date methods, including the one reported by Tsuji et al.,5 are necessary.

      "title": "Exploring the connection between sleep disorders and neurological diseases: implications for diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

      "title": "1510 Unusual Presentation of Kleine-Levin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnolence associated with cognitive dysfunction, altered perception, hyperphagia, hypersexuality and disinhibited behaviors. Between episodes there is typically a return to normal alertness and cognitive function. Patients with chronic hypersomnia presentations in KLS are less common. Report of case We describe a 23 year old male with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and early-onset bipolar disorder (age 4). At age 16, he sought care after missing five months of school due to periods of severe somnolence sleeping 12-13 hours daily. He presented to the hospital on three occasions with episodes of hypersomnia, lethargy, bradycardia, and hypotension. Brain MRI, toxicology, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and an echocardiogram were unremarkable. Polysomnography (PSG) revealed mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI: 8 events/hr), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) showed a mean sleep latency of 5.8 min and 3 SOREMPs. He was unable to tolerate modafinil due to tremors, mood disturbance and, aggression. Eventually, he was diagnosed with KLS following a 3-day episode of hypersomnolence during which he was unarousable. Partial symptomatic improvement was achieved with clarithromycin and minocycline but residual hypersomnia was still debilitating. Due to inability to stay awake at school, he was enrolled in virtual high school. Despite this, he was unable to complete high school. He has become socially withdrawn and lost many of his friends. A year later, following the initiation of clarithromycin treatment, his wakefulness increased to 8 hours per day. However, symptoms worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic leading to an increased dosing with minimal effect. Despite treatment, he continued to experience episodes of hypersomnia lasting months at a time where he sleeps up to 18 hours daily. Severe weight loss (BMI: 17.0) has occurred due to limited wakeful hours and loss of appetite. Conclusion While still within the expected decade of symptom resolution in chronic KLS, he shows atypical features: persistence hypersomnolence in between episodes, significant weight loss causing failure to thrive, and social withdrawal leading to depression. Multidisciplinary management is crucial to address his complex clinical presentation of KLS and enhance his quality of life. Support (if any)",

      "title": "The Diagnostic Value of the Sleep EEG With and Without Sleep Deprivation in Patients With Atypical Absences",
      "abstract": "Summary: Hitherto it has not been known whether or not the sleep EEG after sleep deprivation is more effective than the simple or drug‐induced sleep EEG. To investigate this, we recorded for 32 patients both sleep EEGs without sleep deprivation and, on the following day, sleep EEGs after 24 h of sleep deprivation. All the patients had atypical absences which were almost exclusively combined with generalized seizures or some other seizure types. All patients were receiving antiepileptic therapy. Sleep without sleep deprivation was induced by oral administration of 2 mg/kg body weight Protactyl® (promazine hydrochloride). In patients showing no epileptic activity in the routine EEG, epileptic discharges could be provoked in 78% without sleep deprivation and in 72% after sleep deprivation. Epileptic activity was already seen in 28.1% of the cases in the awake EEG without sleep deprivation, recorded immediately before the sleep EEG, and in 50% of the cases in the awake EEG after sleep deprivation. It is unlikely that promazine hydrochloride in the dose used here has an additional inherent provocative effect. Generalized spike‐and‐wave complexes or sharp slow wave complexes which were combined twice with foci and runs of rapid spikes were recorded. In the sleep EEG without sleep deprivation, epileptic discharges were seen in the somewhat shallower stages (C → A→ B → D) and, in the sleep EEG after sleep deprivation, in the somewhat deeper stages (D → C → B → A). Fewer epileptic discharges were elicited in patients who were older at the time of their first seizure. The illness was mild in patients whose sleep EEGs showed no epileptic activity. It is concluded that, as a rule, it is not necessary to record an EEG after sleep deprivation in patients with atypical absences whose routine EEGs show no epileptic activity; the drug‐induced sleep EEG shows the same provocative effect.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterized by dream-enacting behaviours (e.g. punching, shouting, jumping out of bed, etc.) linked to unpleasant dreams (e.g. being attacked or robbed) and excessive electromyographic activity during REM sleep. Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy. Patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly when associated with dementia, had non-RBD episodes of sleep-enactment behaviours occurring upon arousals from either REM or non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "A relationship between neurovegetative symptoms and an increased risk of sudden infant death (SID) has been frequently described. Such symptoms are vomiting because of gastroesophageal reflux, breathing disorders while nutritive sucking, excessive sweating during sleep, prolonged apneas and apneas with associated symptoms, further unexplained episodes of cyanosis, pallor and loss of muscle tone. An acute decompensation of the cardiorespiratory autonomic system during sleep is currently discussed to be one of the causes of SID. Polysomnography investigations are used to diagnose sleep related cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunction. In this study, infants up to the age of 5 months were examined using polysomnography throughout their entire nocturnal sleep. The findings from 79 infants with neurovegetative symptoms were compared with the results from 163 healthy control children. Indications of an impaired respiratory regulation during sleep were shown to be significantly more frequent in infants with neurovegetative symptoms. In particular the occurrence of periodic breathing with a high frequency of periodic apnea plus a large number of acute decreases in oxygen saturation could be shown in infants with neurovegetative symptoms. The findings were most pronounced during the first 1.5 months after birth. The results of this investigations lead to the conclusion that, in the case of young infants with breathing abnormalities, neurovegetative symptoms can frequently be observed. The occurrence of such symptoms should therefore be a reason for a polysomnographic examination.",

On average, the screaming began 4.8 years after the onset signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease. In many cases, sleep talking started before the onset of Parkinson disease. All patients reported that the screaming disrupted the sleep of their families, and half of the patients reported that the screams disturbed their own sleep. The screams were incorporated into their dreams. Clonazepam was effective to alleviate this screaming in 8 out of 9 cases. We considered this screaming to be caused by similar mechanisms as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in which muscle atonia characterizing normal REM sleep is absent. The screams were not accompanied by other abnormal behaviors. We postulate that the screaming is a symptom closely related to that of mid or lower brainstem lesion in Parkinson disease because the neural activity of the locus ceruleus or the pudunculopontine nucleus are responsible for muscle atonia in REM sleep.",

Extrinsic sleep disorders are caused by transient stress or disruptions in the sleep environment. Jet lag and shift work that temporarily disrupt the normal sleep cycle also are considered to be extrinsic sleep disorders. Daytime sleepiness is a very common presenting symptom. It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur. Symptoms that seem bizarre and occur in association with nocturnal sleep or daytime napping should be considered as possible expressions of sleep pathology rather than psychopathology.",

Obstructive sleep apnea results in the absence (apnea) or reduction (hypopnea) of airflow lasting at least 10 s despite normal respiratory exertion. The apnea and hypopnea result in decreased oxygen saturation levels in the blood (hypoxemia). A number of consequences of OSAS can appear including: disruption of the sleep cycle, fragmentation of the sleep cycle, sleepiness, fatigue, headaches, cognitive impairments, irritability and mood disturbance, the higher risk of accidents at work and car accidents, the decrease of the quality of life and the higher risk of cardiovascular diseases.

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Recent insights into the pathophysiology of sleep disorders in PD points to a complex interaction between movement disorders, side-effects of dopamine agents and lesions in sleep-wake regulating systems. Treatment with dopamine agonists provides a twice higher risk of daytime sudden sleep episodes than levodopa, with no difference between ergotic and non ergotic compounds. Insomnia can be improved by a better control of night-time disability, restless legs syndrome and dystonia using subthalamic nucleus stimulation or night-time levodopa. A specific REM sleep disorder contributes to REM sleep behavior disorder and also to hallucinations (suggesting they could be awake dreams) and excessive daytime sleepiness. The management of sleep and alertness problems requires to analyze their potential causes, to monitor night-time and daytime sleep, and to subtly adjust psychotropic and dopaminergic treatment.",

Oxybate, an endogenous metabolite of GABA, acts through GABAB noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons. &amp;lt; 1% may experience suicidal ideations or psychosis. Report of case(s) A 17-year-old female with obesity, spina bifida occulta follows with sleep for idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep (TST 12.6 hours on polysomnography) and a delayed circadian rhythm. Her typical sleep zone is 11:00PM to 10:00AM, but she can easily sleep until 2:00PM. She started sodium oxybate to minimize her sleep burden and improve daytime wakefulness. She initially developed insomnia with concern for mania and migraines with photophobia and phonophobia. After 26 days, oxybate was discontinued. Her migraines persisted daily. Her sleep schedule and mood returned to baseline within 17 days thereafter. A 48-year-old female with anxiety/depression, PTSD has follows with sleep since age 42 for unspecified hypersomnia, either narcolepsy type 1 with long sleep versus idiopathic hypersomnia. Initial polysomnography/MSLT on fluoxetine revealed AHI 1.6, with a mean sleep latency of 6.4 minutes without SOREMPs. Her typical sleep zone was 8:00PM to 9:00AM. She was started on sodium oxybate for her cataplexy and daytime sleepiness. She had remarkable improvement in her symptoms after 4 days. After 35 days on 9 grams nightly she developed anxiety, extracorporeal sensations, and paranoia. The dose was decreased to 7.5 grams nightly. By 7 months of therapy her paranoia progressed to the point where she threatened her landlord and was facing legal consequences. Sodium oxybate was discontinued. At 53-years-old she was trial on mixed-salts oxybate. After three months of therapy, she became hypomanic with severe pressured speech despite a euthymic mood. She reported going without sleep entirely for 3-4 days at a time using this oxybate. Mixed-salts oxybate was discontinued and 36 days later with in addition to quetiapine, her hypomania was nearly resolved and she was able to get 8-9 hours of restful sleep. Conclusion Hypomania appears to be a rare but serious side effect of oxybate in long-sleepers. Discontinuing oxybate may not be sufficient therapy. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Beneficial effects on sleep architecture following nCPAP treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea patients Bozhidar Dimitrov1* 1 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria The Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients suffer, among many other deteriorative clinical signs, of severely disrupted and disorganized night sleep. In early stages of the illness symptoms of concentration and memory loss, fatigue and mood changes are mild and susceptible to overcome. The prolonged negligence in seeking timely help leads in behavioral terms to the appearance of the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) Syndrome, major cause of traffic accidents and occupational hazards, due to inability to sustain vigilance and alertness. We have treated patients with OSA by way of split-night titration, providing nasal Continuous Positive Air Pressure (nCPAP) during the second part of a testing night sleep. Full polysomnography was performed on an Alice3/Alice5, RespironicsTM equipment. Initially, patients with OSA have shown multiple episodes of arousals (up to 100 per hour) that varied from autonomous through cortical to behavioral arousal. They dwelt mostly in shallow early stages 1 or 2 of the sleep (Rechtschaffen & Kales scores) and have had many other concomitant features of the ailment: tachi/bradicardia, low blood oxygenation (down to below 70%), multiple apnea/hypopnea episodes (Respiratory Disturbance Index, RDI, up to 80 per hour). Severe cases were presented with just about an hour of total sleep time. Immediately following the application of a nasal mask and switching to the nCPAP apparatus, patients recovered their normal sleep architecture in the course of minutes. The proportion of slow wave sleep stages 3 and 4 reached 26% of the total sleep time, in many cases the REM-rebound phenomenon occurred: sudden appearance after lights-off of a REM sleep instead of reaching step-wise stage 1 through stage 5 and the duration of REM exceeded several-folds the usual amount. This gradually subsided in the course of nCPAP application for several nights. Arousal and respiratory disturbance indices were down to single-digit scores. All other measured parameters also recovered and the beneficial effect was observed immediately after awakening in the morning when headache, nausea, drowsiness and fatigue were miraculously abolished. Although the cognitive deficit - a characteristic feature of long-time OSA patients - was persistent to some degree for many more months, the quality of life was dramatically improved and these patients were further reintegrated into doing daily routines with flair and easiness. The frequently unappreciated cause of the excessive sleepiness, namely sleep structure disorganization, was relieved by the application of nCPAP apparatus. Since OSA patients in early stages do not really feel seriously treatened and obstinently refuse to turn in for consultation and help, we strongly suggest that a full night polysomnography be performed in any suspicious case of daytime sleepiness and personality aberrations like mood and temper tantrum changes, cognitive and memory deficits.

      "title": "THE EFFECTS OF INDUCED SLEEP FRAGMENTATION ON CARDIAC SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea (OSAH) is a prevalent disorder that occurs in about 5% of the middle-aged adult population. Comprised of repetitive episodes of complete and/or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep, OSAH results in cyclic oxyhemoglobin desaturation-resaturation (e.g. intermittent hypoxia) and arousal from sleep (sleep fragmentation). Consequences of OSAH include increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and elevated sympathetic activity (SA) during daytime wakefulness as well as sleep.This has potential clinical relevance because heightened SA is thought to be one mechanism explaining the association between OSAH and cardiovascular disease. Although OSAH is associated with increased sympathetic contribution to cardiac sympatho-vagal balance (SVB), the pathway mediating this effect (intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation (SF) or both) is unclear. Because obstructive upper airway events in OSAH patients precipitate both physiologic phenomena in a generally concomitant manner, it has been difficult to sort the individual contributions of each in clinical populations.The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SVB and experimentally induced SF including examination of the possible interaction with being overweight in a healthy non-OSAH population. Twenty-nine subjects entered into a 4 night / 3 day sleep study to evaluate the effect of experimentally induced SF. Subjects provided a spectrum of body mass index (BMI) ranging from normal to overweight. Subjects experienced two nights of undisturbed sleep followed by two nights of fragmented sleep. Awake SVB reflected by heart rate variability was measured during wakefulness before and after a night of undisturbed sleep and a night of fragmented sleep. Sleep duration and architecture were assessed under both sleep conditions. SVB was decreased by transient changes from awake to sleep. SVB was affected by SF on an undisturbed night, but not a disturbed night. BMI had no effect. The public health significance of this study was that both OSAH and increased SVB have increased risk of cardiovascular disease; through improved understanding of the relationship between particular components of OSAH (SF or oxygenation-reoxygenation cycle) and increased SVB could lead to improved treatment of OSAH and the reduction of cardiovascular disease in the population.",

      "abstract": "The major physiological consequences of sleep apnea include (excessive) daytime sleepiness and effects on the cardiovascular system. Daytime sleepiness is a typical complaint of sleep apnea patients and has generally been thought to result from the repeated arousals during nighttime sleep that are necessary to breathe, i.e., nighttime sleep of apneic patients is fragmented and not refreshing. Although the daytime sleepiness can occur at any time of the day, it most commonly occurs during the afternoon or early evening. The observation that naps do not usually provide relief from feelings of daytime sleepiness suggests that factors other than nighttime sleep fragmentation may be involved. In this chapter, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review data indicating that cytokines are involved in sleep regulation. We then present evidence that some effects of sleep apnea may include alterations in cytokine proﬁles. Finally, we conclude by speculating that alterations in cytokine concentrations/proﬁles may be one of several causal factors of the daytime sleepiness typically associated with sleep apnea.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children's sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child's period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

The disruption of normal ventilation can be associated with hypoxemia and abnormal sleep patterns. OSA occurs predominantly during REM-sleep. Most affected children present with snoring and breathing problems during sleep. The prevalence of OSA in children is approximately 4%. OSA can be associated with daytime sleepiness and cognitive/behavioral complications like poor school performance and hyperactivity. Cardiovascular complications include pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and systemic hypertension. There is a significant association between apnea-/hypopnea-index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index with raised daytime and nocturnal blood pressure. There is an increasing prevalence of obesity in children. Obesity can interfere with sleep in different ways. A lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk for obesity. On the other hand, obesity can have a negative influence on sleep. An increased soft tissue mass and altered mechanics lead to an increased airflow resistance, causing upper airway obstruction. With the current epidemic of obesity the incidence of OSA due to obesity in younger children may become remarkable. The risk for systemic hypertension caused by obesity is independent from the risk for hypertension caused by obstructive sleep apnea. Insofar, blood pressure and sleep-related breathing should be monitored beginning with an obstructive AHI of 3/hour sleep. Children with OSA should be treated early enough. Prevention and early treatment of obesity as a risk factor for OSA as well as for hypertension is becoming an important social challenge.",

      "title": "Upper airway resistance syndrome: still not recognized and not treated",
      "abstract": "The upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is a sleep breathing disorder described by Guilleminault et al., in 1993, to identify patients that present increased respiratory effort and airflow limitation during sleep associated with an increase in the upper airway resistance. Patients usually complain of daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, and difficulty to maintain sleep. Complains re lated to cognitive impairment, headache, anxiety, and irritability are also frequent. The physical examination shows nasal obstruction, increase in soft tissue and craniofacial abnormalities associated with decrease in the upper airway space. Nocturnal polysomnography does not show apneas or hyponeas for diagnostic criteria of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and respiratory abnormalities consist on periods of increase in respiratory effort, sleep fragmentation, presence of respiratory event related arousal (RERAs) and presence of flattening of respiratory curve, which indicates airflow limitation. Controversies exist regarding the characterization of upper airway resistance syndrome as part of a continuum with other sleep breathing disorders, or as a separate entity that may not progress to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Treatment of upper airway resistance syndrome is more challenging than obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, since patients have lower tolerance for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use. Other treatment modalities have been investigated, but they are still not established for clinical practice. Recognition of upper airway resistance syndrome is important, since it may prevent long-term consequences or progression to more severe forms of sleep-related breathing disorders.",

Light and social cues are important factors that help align the endogenous circadian rhythms to the 24 hour day. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders can be due to abnormalities in the endogenous circadian clock (“intrinsic disorders”) such as delayed sleep phase type, advanced sleep phase type, free running type, and irregular sleep wake rhythm type. Shift work or air travel leads to an artificial mismatch between the endogenous circadian clock and the external environment (“extrinsic disorders”) leading to shift work disorder and jet lag disorder. Individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorders are presented with insomnia or excessive sleepiness or both. These disorders are under recognized in the general population but they can affect a significant number of people if a the large number of shift workers and air travelers are considered. The symptoms may be misdiagnosed for other common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Meticulous history and sleep diary data are integral tools in diagnosing CRSD. Actigraphs (activity monitors) may supplement the sleep diary data. In the past two decades major advances have been made in understanding the genetic basis of these disorders. Understanding the circadian principles has led to various therapeutic options such as phototherapy and exogenous melatonin.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Convergent lines of evidence suggest that SUDEP occurs due to seizure induced perturbation of respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral function as well as potential predisposing factors. It has been consistently observed that SUDEP happens more during the night and the early hours of the morning. The aim of this review is to discuss evidence from patient cases, clinical studies, and animal research which is pertinent to the nocturnality of SUDEP. There are a number of factors which might contribute to the nighttime predilection of SUDEP. These factors fall into four categories: influences of (1) being unwitnessed, (2) lying prone in bed, (3) sleep-wake state, and (4) circadian rhythms. During the night, seizures are more likely to be unwitnessed; therefore, it is less likely that another person would be able to administer a lifesaving intervention. Patients are more likely to be prone on a bed following a nocturnal seizure. Being prone in the accoutrements of a bed during the postictal period might impair breathing and increase SUDEP risk. Sleep typically happens at night and seizures which emerge from sleep might be more dangerous. Lastly, there are circadian changes to physiology during the night which might facilitate SUDEP. These possible explanations for the nocturnality of SUDEP are not mutually exclusive. The increased rate of SUDEP during the night is likely multifactorial involving both situational factors, such as being without a witness and prone, and physiological changes due to the influence of sleep and circadian rhythms. Understanding the causal elements in the nocturnality of SUDEP may be critical to the development of effective preventive countermeasures.",

Case report We describe a patient with a longstanding episodic cluster headache who experienced, on two occasions, a period of nocturnal awakenings without pain or autonomic symptoms, lasting one week before the onset of a cluster bout. Awakenings occurred twice/night at the same hours of impending cluster attacks and had no apparent trigger, being unusual for this patient who had no previous sleep disturbances. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal. Discussion This case documents two new aspects of cluster headache. It suggests that repeated nocturnal awakenings can be a warning sign of an impending cluster period, a finding that may have therapeutic implications, and also that hypothalamic activation may begin several days before trigemino-autonomic symptoms, thus behaving as a true bout generator.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

This article discusses the epidemiology of comorbid OSA and cardiovascular disease, the pathophysiology of OSA, how it acts as a risk factor for cardiovascular problems, and how appropriate treatment of OSA ameliorates the consequences.

In a prospective study, 29 patients with sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome were assessed polysomnographically to determine the relationship of cognitive performance and daytime sleepiness with sleep disruption, hypoxemia, and mood. Deterioration of cognitive performance correlated significantly with increasing severity of nocturnal breathing irregularity, magnitude of nocturnal hypoxemia, and extent of sleep disruption. Multiple regression analysis identified frequency of apneas plus hypopneas and of arousal and the extent of nocturnal hypoxemia as the variables most strongly associated with cognitive deficits. Anxiety and depression also contributed to this impairment. Objective daytime sleepiness was not significantly associated with nocturnal variables. This study showed that the frequency of breathing irregularities and the extent of both sleep disruption and nocturnal hypoxemia are important in determining daytime function in patients with sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. All of these factors should be considered when deciding which patients require treatment.",

Sleep disorders, including vivid dreams and REM sleep with motor behaviors (RBD), are frequent in these patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The association of hallucinations and REM sleep both at night and during the day was examined in 10 consecutive nondemented patients with long-standing levodopa-responsive PD and hallucinations. Seven patients presented with paranoia and paranoid delusions. Overnight sleep recordings and standard multiple daytime sleep latency test were performed. The results were compared to those of 10 similar patients with PD not experiencing hallucinations. <b><i>Results:</i></b> RBD was detected in all 10 patients with hallucinations and in six without. Although nighttime sleep conditions were similar in both groups, hallucinators tended to be sleepier during the day. Delusions following nighttime REM period and daytime REM onsets were observed in three and eight of the hallucinators, and zero and two of the others. Daytime hallucinations, coincident with REM sleep intrusions during periods of wakefulness, were reported only by hallucinators. Postmortem examination of the brain of one patient showed numerous Lewy bodies in neurons of the subcoeruleus nucleus, a region that is involved in REM sleep control. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The visual hallucinations that coincide with daytime episodes of REM sleep in patients who also experience post-REM delusions at night may be dream imagery. Psychosis in patients with PD may therefore reflect a narcolepsy-like REM sleep disorder.",

A enxaqueca e os acufenos são as suas comorbilidades mais prevalentes. Relatamos o caso de um doente de 51 anos, com síndrome de Neve Visual de início recente com fenómenos entópticos realçados, fotofobia e nictalopia. O doente já sofria de enxaqueca sem aura, acufenos e episódios esporádicos de vertigem, tendo desenvolvido a presente síndrome na sequência de um episódio inaugural de aura visual. Relatava ainda fotopsia espoletada pela movimentação cefálica. A terapêutica com lamotrigina melhorou parcialmente os sintomas. Discute-se o caso com base na literatura atual, com o intuito de chamar a atenção para esta síndrome ainda pouco conhecida e muitas vezes interpretada como um quadro não orgânico.",

Sleep may be disturbed by the aging process, age-related medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. There are two common sleep disorders in this population: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome. Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

Ätiologie und 5. resultierende Einschränkungen). Die Beschreibung der iktalen Phänomenologie erfolgt mit Hilfe eines standardisierten Glossars deskriptiver Terminologie (im Internet verfügbar), diejenige der Anfallstypen anhand einer Liste epileptischer Anfallsformen. Sofern möglich, wird anhand einer weiteren Liste die Einordnung des Epilepsie-Syndroms vorgenommen. Auch bei der Ätiologie kann auf eine Liste von Krankheiten zurückgegriffen werden, die häufig mit epileptischen Anfällen oder Epilepsie-Syndromen verknüpft sind. Bei der (optionalen) Benennung resultierender Beeinträchtigungen dient eine Liste der WHO als Orientierung. Darüber hinaus werden einige diagnostische Begriffe gestrichen bzw. durch andere ersetzt (z. B. „einfache” und „komplexe” fokale Anfälle, „partielle” und „lokalisationsbezogene” Syndrome, „konvulsiv” und „Krampf”), bei anderen eine Klarstellung vorgenommen („kryptogen” = „wahrscheinlich symptomatisch”) und einige neue Konzepte vorgeschlagen (z. B. „Epilepsie-Krankheit” mit jeweils nur einer spezifischen Ätiologie oder „epileptische Enzephalopathie” als Zustand, bei dem die epileptischen Vorgänge selbst zu Störungen der zerebralen Funktion führen). Hervorzuheben ist, dass es sich bei diesem Vorschlag nicht um eine neue Klassifikation von Anfällen und Epilepsien bzw. Epilepsie-Syndromen handelt. Das vorgeschlagene Schema soll zunächst zu einer Aktualisierung und Vereinheitlichung des diagnostischen Vokabulars zur Vorbereitung einer zukünftigen neuen Klassifikation bzw. wahrscheinlich mehrerer Klassifikationen für unterschiedliche Bedürfnisse (z. B. für Lehre und Forschung oder klinische Studien) dienen. Es ist flexibel und soll neuen Erkenntnissen in der Zukunft bei Bedarf jeweils angepasst werden.",

      "title": "Women and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Several studies over the years have demonstrated that sleep complaints in general, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in particular, tend to be more prevalent among women. The 2007 Sleep in America poll of women age 40–60 years old found that 20% reported sleepiness that interfered with daily life (Chasens et al., Behav Sleep Med 8(3):157–71, 2010). This chapter discusses EDS due to primary sleep disorders other than Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) including Narcolepsy, Recurrent Hypersomnia, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Behaviorally Induced Insufficient Sleep Syndrome as well as Hypersomnia Due to Medical condition and Hypersomnia Due to Drug or Substance. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the tetrad of EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnapompic hallucinations. Recurrent hypersomnia is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia often associated with other symptoms that typically last weeks or months apart. Episodes usually last a few days to several weeks and appear one to ten times a year. Sleep and general behavior must be normal between episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) and Menstrual-related hypersomnia are two distinct clinical subtypes of recurrent hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by constant and severe excessive sleepiness. Naps are typically unrefreshing and post-awakening confusion (sleep drunkenness) is often reported. EDS is a very prevalent problem in developed societies. Women tend to complain more of EDS than men. This prevalence may partially be due to greater sleep deprivation, hormonal factors, and the higher incidence of some primary and secondary sleep disorders in women.",

      "abstract": "A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. \"parasomnia overlap disorder\") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, \"parasomnia overlap disorder\" is a treatable condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol during sleep.",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered breathing in children",
      "abstract": "The first series of children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome was reported in 1976. Later it became apparent that children may have breathing disorders during sleep without frank apnoea or 'hypopnoeas'. This pattern could be detected by measuring the oesophageal pressure. This led to the concept of sleep-disordered breathing as a spectrum that combines obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and the upper airway resistance syndrome. Studies that do not take into account this spectrum may misclassify symptomatic patients as 'primary snorers'. The exact prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in children is unknown but may be as high as 11%. There is a familial predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal obstruction and mouth breathing influence facial growth, which may further lead to difficulty in breathing while asleep. Symptoms include an increase in total sleep time, nonspecific behavioural difficulties, hyperactivity, irritability, bed-wetting and morning headaches. Clinical signs include failure to thrive, increased respiratory effort with nasal flaring and suprasternal or intercostal retractions. Also, abnormal paradoxical inward motion of the chest may occur during sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness and obesity are not always present. Untreated children may develop cardiovascular complications. The condition is treatable with continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure, and may be cured with surgery.",

Currently, the diagnosis for sleep apnea is established by performing a Polysomnography, which monitors the patient's vitals while asleep. This requires the presence of a medical expert to confirm the diagnosis. In this paper, a novel method of detecting the presence of sleep apnea is proposed from the patient's ECG and respiratory data. This can be used to develop a low cost diagnostic tool for smart devices using low cost sensors with Bluetooth connectivity, in an attempt to improve healthcare support and make it more accessible for the rural population.",

Both on the experimental and clinical plan sleep deprivation has been considered to be responsible for psychotic disorders. Over the past fifteen years these results have been controversial. Polygraphic study of sleep in eight patients hospitalized in a post-operative intensive care unit confirmed this nightly sleep deprivation; the deep slow wave sleep decreases and there is often a lack of paradoxical sleep. Analysis of these eight cases corroborates the latest experimental résults on sleep deprivation and current methodological considerations. Sleep deprivation in itself does not seem to lead to major psychiatric disorders but it is one of the factors, contributing to genesis of psychiatric troubles in an intensive care unit. The other ones that have been suggested (environment, somatic pathology, psychological ill effects due to the hospitalization) are also quite important.",

We review all Henoch–Schönlein cases published after 1969 with CNS dysfunction without severe hypertension and neuroimaging studies (n = 35), cranial or peripheral neuropathy (n = 15), both CNS and peripheral nervous system dysfunction without severe hypertension (n = 2) or nervous system dysfunction with severe hypertension (n = 2). Forty-four of the 54 patients were <20 years of age. Results. In patients with CNS dysfunction without or with severe hypertension the following presentations were observed in decreasing order of frequency: altered level of consciousness, convulsions, focal neurological deficits, visual abnormalities and verbal disability. Imaging studies disclosed the following lesions: vascular lesions almost always involving two or more vessels, intracerebral haemorrhage, posterior subcortical oedema, diffuse brain oedema and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Following lesions were noted in the subjects with cranial or peripheral neuropathy without severe hypertension: peroneal neuropathy, peripheral facial palsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, brachial plexopathy, posterior tibial nerve neuropathy, femoral neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex. Persisting signs of either CNS (n = 9) or peripheral (n = 1) nervous system dysfunction were sometimes reported. Conclusions. In Henoch–Schönlein syndrome, signs of nervous system dysfunction are uncommon but clinically relevant.

Chronic medication use, neurological or psychiatric disorders, and environmental factors can also contribute. This chapter discusses the diagnosis of sleep disturbances, and both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.",

      "title": "Relationship Between Sleep Disorders and Mental Health",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, indices/hour of arousals, awakenings, apnea/hypopnea, and periodic leg movements were similar in both groups. Age, but not dopaminergic medication, had a negative impact on sleep architecture in patients with IPD. There was no correlation between sleep efficiency assessed by PSG and sleep quality assessed by questionnaire.The results confirmed a reduction in muscle atonia during REM sleep as a characteristic finding in early IPD. However, there were no further disease-inherent or medication-induced changes in sleep architecture.

One polygraphic recording followed by a single multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to differentiate the causes of syndromes with complaints of daytime somnolence. Prospective investigations have demonstrated that patients with periodic leg movements or upper airway resistance syndrome may present abnormal sleep latencies and more than one sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP) during MSLT. On the other hand, investigations of patients with daytime sleepiness and cataplexy have shown that the MSLT may not show more than one SOREMP. The combination of history of cataplexy and more than one SOREMP during MSLT is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy. History of daytime sleepiness and presence of more than one SOREMP during MSLT, however, is a poorer discriminant of narcolepsy than history of cataplexy, particularly in an aging population.",

The nervous patient sleeps badly, but the nature of the insomnia varies in many ways. Some go to sleep the moment they lie down, only to awake an hour or two later, to toss throughout the night, and possibly to doze off at the hour when they should awake. Others sleep well till the first peep of day, rising ill-humored and cross, having lost two of their nine hours' sleep.

The poor correlation between symptoms and AHI complicates diagnosis and reports that mild OSAS is not significantly associated with comorbidity casts doubt on clinical significance. The diagnosis is complicated by night-to-night variability and by underestimation of AHI in ambulatory sleep studies that do not include sleep assessment. Active management of mild OSAS can be symptom-driven and offers a broad range of options. Lifestyle measures may be sufficient in many cases and mandibular advancement devices or positional therapy may be more effective in mild OSAS. Sleepy patients with low AHI may warrant a trial of continuous positive airway pressure therapy to establish the relationship between sleep disordered breathing and symptoms.Management of mild OSAS can focus on symptom relief to the individual patient.",

Although not constituting diagnostic criteria, sleep fragmentation events, such as brief awakenings (arousals), increased oscillations in the cyclic alternating pattern of sleep, and alpha-wave intrusion into non-rapid eye movement sleep, are common in individuals with sleep disorders. Among the various manifestations of fibromyalgia, nonrestorative sleep is an important aspect that necessitates the investigation of primary sleep disorders in the evaluation of affected patients. The association between fibromyalgia and sleep disordered breathing was first described in 1986 in a report stating that three out of eleven patients with sleep apnea met the criteria for fibromyalgia. In seven of those patients, polysomnography revealed a pattern of fragmented sleep similar to the alpha-delta pattern. (1) Subsequent studies can be divided into those that evaluated sleep disordered breathing in patients with fibromyalgia and those that evaluated the manifestations of fibromyalgia in patients with sleep apnea. Sleep disordered breathing in patients with fibromyalgia has been more widely studied. Among the various articles, one significant 1993 study was conducted with twenty fibromyalgia patient and ten healthy volunteers. The authors found no difference between the two groups in terms of the frequency of apnea-hypopnea indices higher than five events per hour of sleep (20% of the cases in each group). However, they also found that the patients with sleep apnea presented greater sleep fragmentation.

      "abstract": "Hypersomnia is a group of diseases that share the main symptom - excessive daytime sleepiness, not caused by disturbances in nocturnal sleep or circadian rhythms. Excessive daytime sleepiness is present in 15.6% of adults in the world, a Russian study showed a prevalence of 39.2%. It is associated with a wide range of comorbidities, including obesity and mental disorders, on the other hand, the presence of hypersomnia increases the likelihood of mental illness. People with hypersomnia are more likely to take medications, have a decreased quality of life, spend more health care resources, and more often receive social benefits. The heritability is estimated to be about 40% for sleep duration and 17% for excessive daytime sleepiness. Hypersomnia in mental disorders is secondary. It most often occurs in patients with depression or bipolar disorder. To assess the severity of daytime sleepiness, self-observation and objective methods, including the multiple sleep latency test, actigraphy, polysomnography, are used. In the differential diagnosis of hypersomnia in psychiatric disorders, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis with hypersomnia caused by taking medications or other substances and insufficient sleep syndrome. The etiology of prolonged sleep in psychiatric disorders is complex, and includes biological and psychological causes. The relationship between self-reported hypersomnia and sleep actually obtained is still unclear. Results of daily polysomnography show a significant increase in time in bed during the day and night (clinophilia). Therapy of hypersomniac syndromes should be done taking into account the etiology of the disease. In cases of secondary nature, the main efforts should be directed to the treatment of the underlying mental disorder causing somnolence.Гиперсомнии — это группа заболеваний, которые объединяет основной симптом — чрезмерная дневная сонливость (ЧДС), не обусловленная нарушением ночного сна или циркадианных ритмов. ЧДС присутствует у 15,6% взрослого населения в мире, в российском исследовании показана распространенность 39,2%. Она связана с широким спектром сопутствующих заболеваний, включая ожирение и психические расстройства, с другой стороны, наличие гиперсомнии повышает вероятность развития психических заболеваний. Люди с гиперсомнией чаще принимают лекарственные препараты, имеют сниженное качество жизни, тратят больший ресурс здравоохранения и чаще получают социальные выплаты. Наследуемость оценивается: примерно 40% для продолжительности сна и 17% для чрезмерной дневной сонливости. Гиперсомния при психических расстройствах носит вторичный характер. Наиболее часто она возникает на фоне депрессии и биполярного расстройства. Для оценки выраженности дневной сонливости используют методы самонаблюдения и объективные — множественный тест латентности сна, актиграфию, полисомнографию. При дифференциальной диагностике гиперсомнии при психических расстройствах необходимо проводить дифференциальный диагноз с гиперсомнией, вызванной приемом лекарственных препаратов или других веществ и синдромом недостаточного сна. Этиология длительного сна при психических расстройствах сложна и включает биологические и психологические причины. До сих пор остается неясной связь между самооценкой гиперсомнии и фактически полученным сном. Результаты суточной полисомнографии показывают значительное увеличение времени в постели в течение дня и ночи (клинофилия).

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Psychiatric illness is an important potential cause of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypersomnia, and narcolepsy-like symptoms. We report a case of hypersomnia and pseudo-cataplexy associated with schizoaffective disorder. Report of Case A 28-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and schizoaffective disorder presented to our sleep medicine clinic complaining of EDS, cataplexy-like attacks, sleep paralysis, depressed mood, and dream intrusion. Questions about cataplexy often provoked brief episodes of speech arrest, eye closure, and neck flexion lasting a few seconds. An MSLT with CPAP showed a mean sleep latency of 3 minutes and 3 sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs); however, actigraphy showed that the SOREMPs occurred during the patient’s habitual sleep period and the patient discontinued a REM-suppressing medication within a few days of the study. The HLA-DQB1*0602 allele was absent. Following circadian adjustment, a repeat MSLT with CPAP showed zero sleep and no SOREMPs. The preceding polysomnogram showed a total sleep time (TST) of 7.8 hours, no epileptiform activity, adequately-treated OSA, and a REM latency of 53 minutes. Prior to these studies, two weeks of sleep diary and actigraphy showed a TST greater than 10 hours. Ultimately, treatment of the patient’s psychiatric disorder resulted in a reduction of his EDS and TST. Conclusion Patients with psychiatric illness can present with hypersomnia, EDS, and narcolepsy-like symptoms such as pseudo-cataplexy. Misdiagnosing such a patient with narcolepsy can lead to treatments capable of worsening the primary underlying psychiatric disturbance. MSLT results must be interpreted in the context of a patient’s clinical history and sleep schedule; if there is concern for a false positive result, repeat testing should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by repetitive partial or complete upper airway obstruction that lead to hemodynamic changes, arousals from sleep and intermittent hypoxia. Obstructive sleep apnea activates multiple pathways that lead to vascular disease. The vascular risk imposed by obstructive sleep apnea may be mediated through the metabolic consequences of sleep-disordered breathing. There is increasing evidence that obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with dyslipidemia, a well known vascular risk factor. However, the role of obstructive sleep apnea in causality of dyslipidemia remains to be established. Current article focuses on possible mechanisms linking obstructive sleep apnea with the development of dyslipidemia. Possible role of obstructive sleep apnea as a therapeutic target to improve dyslipidemia is also discussed. Key words: dyslipidemia - obstructive sleep apnea.",

Diese werden durch vegetative Symptome, Kribbelsensationen und tiefgründiges \"Ewigkeitsgefühl\" eingeleitet. Sie sind gefolgt von entweder spontaner Erholung oder - in einem Drittel der Anfälle - von kurzzeitigem vollständigem Bewusstseinsverlust. Mittels eines implantierten EKG-Recorders gelingt es, eine Asystolie von 15 Sekunden zu dokumentieren. Mit der Einlage eines Schrittmachers verschwinden die Bewusstseinsverlustepisoden, die Anfälle mit den vegetativen Sensationen und \"Ewigkeitsgefühl\" persistieren. Erst mit einer antiepileptischen Therapie wird eine Kontrolle der letzteren Symptome erzielt, wobei eine vollständige Symptomfreiheit bis heute nicht erreicht werden kann. Handelt es sich primär um eine Asystolie mit konsekutiver hypoxischer zerebraler Symptomatik oder tritt die Asystolie in Folge eines epileptischen Leidens auf? Die beiden Hypothesen zu diesem Fall werden diskutiert.",

The interruption of synchrony between the patient and the ventilator has been reported to be a possible cause of nocturnal sleep disruption leaking to arousals, awakenings and reduced periods of stage 3 and REM sleep overnight. The cause of PVA is multi-factorial driven frequently by leak at the interface, changing respiratory breathing patterns and changes in sleep stages. It currently remains unclear as to whether the PVA is the cause of sleep fragmentation or if PVA is purely a marker of unsuccessful ventilatory control, patient discomfort and underlying sleep disruption.",

      "abstract": "Of all the forms of chronic insomnia, perhaps the most insidious is Psychophysiologic insomnia, also called Primary Insomnia in the DSM-IV. This sleep disorder is a final common pathway for many people who initially develop sleeplessness in the context of acute stressors (e.g., pain, job loss), but then acquire a form of \"learned\" sleeplessness as they become increasingly overconcerned about their unsatisfying sleep patterns. Patients report reduced total sleep time, with increased sleep latency (greater than 30 min), or increased wakeafter sleep onset time, though these findings are not always corroborated on PSG studies. Patients with this form of chronic insomnia are often vexed by its seemingly unpredictable nature from night to night, but to be diagnosed symptoms must be present on three or more nights per week, for more than 1 month (DSM-IV) or 6 months (ICSD-2). The essential feature of this form of insomnia is a pattern of sleep disturbance that evolves over time as a result of psychological distress that triggers unhelpful behaviors and physiological arousal. This chapter will summarize the current understanding of the development of this disorder, and the clinical approaches that may be useful to resolve it.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

This results in cessation (apnoea) or reduction (hypopnoea) of airflow, leading to oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. An individual's disposition to develop OSAHS depends on the collapsibility of a segment of the upper airway. The degree of collapsibility can be quantified by the balance between occluding or extraluminal pressures of the surrounding tissues. Patients can experience snoring, unrefreshing sleep, witnessed apnoeas, waking with a choking sensation and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSAHS has a broad range of consequences, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive sequelae. Treatment options include lifestyle measures, in particular weight loss, and strategies to maintain upper airway patency overnight, including continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement devices and positional modifiers.",

Case report we report the case of a 41-year-old female who has no psychiatric history. The patient went to emergency department because when she was starting to sleep, in the first state of sleep, she felts a sensation of paralysis in all her body, with incapacity for breathing, chest oppression and tactile hallucinations like something or someone was touching her entire body. Due to that, the patient awoke frightened, with high levels of anxiety, with heart palpitations, shortness of breath, trembling, choking feeling, sweating, nausea and fear of dying. When the patient arrived to the emergency department, she was suffering a panic attack, thinking that she could have some kind of neurological disease or she was suffering a heart attack. after treating the panic attack with 1 mg of lorazepam, all the symptoms subsided gradually. Discussion in this case report, we present a patient with a new-onset parasomnia, with hypnagogic hallucinations and a panic attack at the awakening. It is known that stress factors are closely associated with parasomnias, as we can see in this case because the patient was moving and she was sleeping in a new place. Conclusions Parasomnias are very frequently present in general population and they can trigger intense anxiety status that can lead to panic attacks.

      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal wheeze has been known for at least 300 years, but only recently widely recognised. Wakening between 3 and 4 a.m. with wheeze may be associated with a 'morning dip' in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), worse in REM sleep, and with a circadian rhythm. Earlier suggestions that plasma histamine rose with nocturnal bronchoconstriction cannot be confirmed, but circulating adrenaline may be reduced in asthmatics at night. Hypoxia at night is common in asthmatics, associated with hypoventilation in REM sleep. Increasing frequency of nocturnal wheeze may herald acute severe asthma. Beta<sub>2</sub> agonists inhaled on retiral do not last to prevent the 'morning dip' in PEFR, but slow-release theophyllines can prevent this, and also relieve symptoms. However, sleep is still disturbed (by EEG criteria), as is nocturnal hypoxaemia. Nocturnal wheeze and/or 'morning dip' in PEFR occur in both atopic and non-atopic asthmatics, and the mechanism of nocturnal wheeze remains to be determined. Recognition of this common symptom remains a major indication for oral slow-release theophyllines.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a frequent and disabling phenomenon among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Daytime sleepiness is a typical symptom of the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome due to nocturnal hypoxia and recurrent arousals causing sleep fragmentation. Since MS plaques are often found in the midbrain, brain stem and upper cervical cord on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we hypothesized that fatigue in MS patients might be caused by a central respiratory dysfunction. We investigated 10 patients with definite MS by oligography, two questionnaires assessing fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), MRI and pulmonary function tests. A total of six patients had either an elevated FSS and/or an elevated ESS. None of the six patients with an elevated FSS and/or ESS has an apnoea index &gt; 5/hour. CT 90 was normal in nine patients. We conclude that fatigue and daytime sleepiness in MS cannot be explained by nocturnal apnoeas or oxygen desaturations. The Fatigue Severity Scale should be integrated to the extended Barthel index, which is a new instrument for disability assessment in MS patients.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic central sleep apnea (ICSA) is categorized as a type of nonhypercapnic central sleep apnea (CSA). Recurrent cessation and resumption of respiration leads to sleep fragmentation, which causes excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or both. ICSA has been described in the adult population but there is limited information in children. The purpose of this study was to describe clinical manifestations and polysomnographic findings in children with ICSA.A retrospective review of medical records and polysomnograms was performed for 14 pediatric patients with ICSA, 9 from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and 5 from Antwerp University Hospital. Polysomnographic features of patients with ICSA were compared with those of nine age-matched control group subjects. Patients with CSA caused by medical or neurological disorders, medication use, or substance use were excluded.Sleep complaints were common in the 14 children with ICSA, including those with sleep-onset insomnia (7 children), frequent nighttime awakening (3 children), restless sleep (7 children), and daytime sleepiness (5 children). Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing were noted in 11 of 14 subjects. Compared to that of the control group, sleep latency in the ICSA group was significantly prolonged (P < .05). The percentage of stage 2 sleep was significantly higher (P < .05), and slow wave sleep was significantly lower in patients with ICSA (P < .05).Similar to adult patients, children with ICSA present with complaints of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Analysis of polysomnograms reveals prolonged sleep latency, increased stage 2 sleep, and decreased slow wave sleep. Further studies are needed to assess mechanisms and the role of hypercapnic response in the pathogenesis of children with ICSA.",

      "abstract": "Hypersomnia, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and prolonged nocturnal sleep, poses significant challenges to individuals' daily functioning. Afflicted individuals struggle to stay awake during waking hours despite extended periods of sleep, often experiencing difficulties waking up in the morning. Cognitive functions, including memory and concentration, may be impaired, leading to social and occupational hindrances. While short naps provide minimal relief, hypersomnia's impact on overall well-being necessitates timely diagnosis and intervention. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive assessment of medical history and, if required, polysomnography. Treatment strategies, ranging from lifestyle modifications to pharmacological interventions, aim to address the underlying causes, which may be primary or secondary to other medical conditions. Timely recognition and management of hypersomnia are crucial to mitigating its adverse effects on daily life and fostering improved sleep quality and daytime alertness.",

      "abstract": "Sleep structure is qualitatively and quantitatively changed by aging. The elderly usually go to bed in early evening and wake up in early morning, and they also take several naps in the day time. The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly. However, insomnia following the mental disturbance (depression), chronic use of drug or alcohol, dementia (vascular or Alzheimer type) are also important in the elderly. Sleep apnea syndrome is recently found as an important cause of insomnia. Concerning the treatment and prevention of insomnia, it is necessary to exclude the causes of insomnia, to improve the environmental conditions and to keep the regular rhythm of sleep-wake cycle. It is also important to carefully select and use the adequate hypnotics considering the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of the drugs in the elderly.",

Several REM parasomnias are consistent with sleep dissociations, where certain elements of the REM sleep pattern emerge in an inadequate time (sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations and cataplexy) or are absent/partial in their normal REM sleep time (REM sleep without atonia, underlying REM sleep behavior disorder). The rest of REM parasomnias (sleep related painful erection, catathrenia) may have other still unclear mechanisms. REM parasomnias deserve attention, because in addition to disturbing sleep and causing injuries, they may shed light on REM sleep functions as well as the heterogeneous etiologies of parasomnias. One of them, REM sleep behavior disorder has special importance as a warning sign of evolving neurodegenerative conditions mainly synucleinopathies (some cases synucleinopathies themselves) and it is a model parasomnia revealing that parasomnias may have by autoimmune, iatrogenic and even psychosomatic etiologies.",

All these 60 patients underwent clinical evaluation and video EEG polysomnography. In 8 out of 60 (13%) patients, sleep apnoea was documented. Five patients had obstructive sleep apnoea, 3 had mixed sleep apnoea and none had pure central sleep apnoea syndrome. Three-fourths of the patients were obese (mean weight 82kg) middle aged males (mean age 46.3 years). The main symptoms encountered were excessive daytime somnolence and snoring. The symptom severity was found to correspond directly with the duration of symptoms as well as obesity. Sleep apnoea syndromes must be seriously considered and documented in all patients complaining of excessive daytime somnolence.",

It is characterised by partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, causing intermittent hypoxia. Both anatomical (severe nasal obstruction, craniofacial anomalies, hypertrophy of the pharyngeal lymphoid tissue, laryngeal anomalies, etc.) and functional factors (neuromuscular diseases) predispose to OSAS during childhood. The main cause of OSAS in children in adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The most common clinical manifestations of OSAS are: nocturnal snoring, respiratory pauses, restless sleep and mouth breathing. Nocturnal pulse oximetry, nocturnal noise audio/videotape recording and nap polysomnography are useful tools for screening suspected cases of OSAS in children, and the gold-standard for diagnosis is overnight polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. On the contrary of SAOS adults, children usually present: less arousals associated to apnea events, more numerous apneas/hypopneas during REM sleep, and more significant oxihemoglobin dessaturation even in short apneas. The treatment of OSAS may be surgical (adenotonsillectomy, craniofacial abnormalities correction, tracheostomy) or clinical (sleep hygiene, continuous positive airway pressure – CPAP).",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are becoming more prevalent. There is an overlap of symptoms related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and many psychiatric conditions. Complaints of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and depressive symptoms can be related to both disease states. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by repetitive disruption of sleep by cessation of breathing and was first described in the 19th century by bedside observation during sleep. Physicians observed this cessation of breathing while the patient slept and postulated that these episodes were responsible for subsequent complaints of sleepiness. OSAS can coexist with major depressive disorder, exacerbate depressive symptoms, or be responsible for a large part of the symptom complex of depression. Additionally, in schizophrenia, sleep apnea may develop as a result of chronic neuroleptic treatment and its effect on gains in body weight, a major risk factor for the development of OSAS.It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Recognition of the existence of sleep apnea, prompt referral to a sleep specialist, and ultimately treatment of an underlying sleep disorder, such as OSAS, can ameliorate symptoms of psychiatric disease.",

Disorders of a physiological phenomenon such as sleep lead to important changes in state of quiescence of the cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic systems during the night. Consequences of SDB (microawakening, sleep fragmentation, hypoxemia) represent important harmful triggers on the cardiovascular system, above all in patients suffering by inability of the heart to provide an adequate output such as for heart failure (HF) patients.

Aural symptoms become permanent during the course of the disease. (2) Attacks of vestibular migraine may last anywhere from minutes to days. Most patients have a previous history of migraine headaches, and many experience migraine symptoms during the attack. (3) Vertebrobasilar TIAs affect older adults with vascular risk factors. Most attacks last less than 1 hour and are accompanied by other symptoms from the posterior circulation territory. (4) Vestibular paroxysmia is caused by vascular compression of the eighth cranial nerve. It manifests itself with brief attacks of vertigo that recur many times per day, sometimes with concomitant cochlear symptoms. (5) Orthostatic hypotension causes brief episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to a few minutes after standing up and is relieved by sitting or lying down. In older adults, it may be accompanied by supine hypertension. (6) Panic attacks usually last minutes, occur in specific situations, and are accompanied by choking, palpitations, tremor, heat, and anxiety. Less common causes of spontaneous recurrent vertigo and dizziness include perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence, autoimmune inner ear disease, otosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, and medication side effects.Neurologists need to venture into otolaryngology, internal medicine, and psychiatry to master the differential diagnosis of recurrent dizziness.",

Insomnia merupakan persepsi atau keluhan atas kualitas tidur yang buruk ditandai dengan kesulitan memulai tidur, mempertahankan tidur, dan terbangun terlalu dini di pagi hari yang dapat menyebabkan kelelahan, kecemasan, kurang konsentrasi, hingga depresi yang dapat mengganggu aktifitas harian. \r\nData prevalensi insomnia sangat beragam di indonesia 10% dari total penduduk mengalami gangguan sulit tidur atau insomnia dan 15% diantaranya adalah kasus insomnia kronis. Insomnia sendiri diklasifikasikan ke beberapa hal. Berdasarkan waktu insomnia terbagi menjadi insomnia transien, insomnia jangka pendek, dan insomnia kronis, sedangkan berdasarkan etiologinya insomnia dibedakan menjadi insomnia primer dan insomnia sekunder.\r\nDalam TCM insomnia dapat diakibatkan karena defisiensi Qi jantung dan kandung empedu yang bisa diakibatkan karena pola hidup yang kurang baik, terlalu lama menderita penyakit, atau mengkonsumsi obat terlalu sering sehingga dapat menguras Qi dan darah. Penanganan insomnia dapat dilakukan menggunakan terapi kombinasi pijat swedia, tuina dan nutrisi olahan daun kelor. Pemberian pijat kombinasi adalah untuk memberikan efek relaksasi dan memanipulasi langsung kedalam titik akupuntur sedangkan pemberian nutrisi olahan daun kelor sebagai asupan tambahan sehingga insomnia dapat berkurang. Terapi pijat dilakukan menggunakan teknik swedia pada seluruh tubuh dan teknik tuina pada beberapa titik akupuntur seperti Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Pishu (BL20), Weishu (BL21), Shenshu (BL23), Fengchi (GB20), Jianjing (GB 21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Shenting (GV24), Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), dan Sibai (ST2) yang dilakukan 21 kali terapi.

Approximately 10% of the general population and 20% of primary care attendees suffer from severe insomnia. Clinical hallmarks of sleeplessness are the patients' complaints about insufficient and non-restorative sleep, severe daytime consequences without any tendency to fall asleep and presence of symptoms on three days per week for more than one month. Insomniacs tend to suffer from psycho-physiologic hyperarousal that prevents physical and mental relaxation. They are more susceptible to stress and seem to have a high sympathetic drive. Insomnia therefore has been compared to chronic caffeine intoxication. It must he pointed out that insomnia is probably more a qualitative rather than a quantitative disorder of sleep. Neither doctors nor patients routinely talk about disturbed sleep during consultations which might he one reason why insomnia very often goes undiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should routinely inquire afoul their patients' sleep and sleeping habits and take, if appropriate, a full sleep history on the basis of which further investigational and therapeutic steps can be planned: well-established tools of proved efficacy are available to treat both primary and secondary insomnia. Acute or transient insomnia lasting less than four weeks can he treated with hypnotics.

      "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) varies throughout the day owing to interactions between the sympathetic nervous and the renin–angiotensin systems. When awake BP is controlled by sympathetic nervous system activity but during sleep the renin–angiotensin system becomes more important. The lower BP during sleep is a more powerful predictor of outcome than the awake BP. Certain individuals do not have the fall in BP with sleep and this worsens the outcome. Inadequate handling of sodium by the kidney is an important factor preventing this BP fall. The different drug classes have varying effects on BP during 24 h. Drugs that act independently of the two controlling systems have a similar effect at day and night. Drugs that act on the sympathetic nervous system have a greater effect during the day and little effect during sleep unless the sympathetic system is still active. Drugs that act via the renin–angiotensin system have a greater effect during sleep. Controlling BP during sleep may improve outcome.",

Am häufigsten ist die NT1 mit einer Prävalenz von 1/2000. Erste Symptome treten häufig vor dem 15. Geburtstag auf. Leitsymptome sind exzessive Tagesmüdigkeit, Kataplexie (affektiver Tonusverlust), hypnagoge Halluzinationen, Schlafparalyse und fragmentierter Nachtschlaf. Die Kataplexie kann bei Kindern durch eine anhaltende faziale Hypotonie und Zungen-Protrusion gekennzeichnet sein. Der Verlust des Neurotransmitters Hypocretin im Liquor gilt als spezifischer Biomarker. Die differenzialdiagnostische Einordnung der zentralen Hypersomnien gelingt in der Regel anhand der Anamnese und der Befunde von Polysomnografie (PSG) und multiplem Schlaflatenz-Test (MSLT). Frühe Diagnosestellung und Therapie führen zu einer Verbesserung der Lebensqualität und erleichtern die Eingliederung in das Berufsleben. Die Tagesmüdigkeit kann durch regelmäßigen Nachtschlaf und kurze Schlafpausen tagsüber gelindert werden, in der Regel werden zusätzlich Stimulanzien verabreicht. Das bei der NT1 häufig eingesetzte Natriumoxybat ist auch gegen die Kataplexie wirksam.",

In these idiopathic cases, gender did not affect the age distribution and age did not affect the range of most affected frequencies or the severity of hearing loss. Vertigo at onset of the disease was not a sign of poor prognosis. Cases in the idiopathic group could, generally, be distinguished into two groups: (1) cases with hearing loss affecting all (with one exception) or mainly the high frequencies and symptomatology reminiscent of known types of cranial (poly)neuritis; (2) cases with hearing loss affecting mainly the low frequencies and symptomatology reminiscent of Ménière's disease. These data suggest that there may be certain pathophysiologic similarities in these cases with: (a) cranial (poly)neuritis if all or mainly the high frequencies are affected; (b) Ménière's disease if the low frequencies are mainly affected.",

      "title": "1440 Fractured Sleep: Serious Injury Uncovers a Challenging Case of Abnormal Movements in Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Disorders of arousal (DoA) and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) are difficult to distinguish. Both involve abnormal movements in sleep that may lead to serious harm to the patient or others. We present a case of abnormal movements in sleep leading to serious injury and discuss diagnostic features of SHE. Report of case The patient is a 48-year-old male with severe OSA on CPAP. He presented after multiple falls from bed. One fall resulted in a right tibial-fibular fracture requiring surgical fixation. He described five to ten episodes of nightly rhythmic limb movements leading to falls out of bed. The episodes occurred in the first half of the night. After an event, he would experience full awakening with preserved memory of rhythmic body movements leading to fall. Events were not dream related and devoid of sleepwalking, sex-related behavior, or sleep eating. Comprehensive physical and neurologic exam was only notable for ecchymoses on the right forearm. In-lab polysomnography on CPAP showed successful control of OSA and simultaneously captured eight episodes of abrupt onset stereotyped motor activity arising out of N3 sleep. These 30-90 second episodes included rhythmic arm flapping, head bobbing and synchronized leg movements. EEG during episodes was obscured by muscle artifact. EEG following episodes showed wake rhythm. There were no epileptiform discharges, hypersynchronous activity or build up to the episodes. The patient was treated with one milligram of oral clonazepam nightly and the episodes improved. He has had no falls out of bed or injuries since starting medication. Conclusion Distinguishing SHE from DoA is challenging. EEG abnormalities are not found in the majority of cases of SHE and more than half of patients are reported to have a normal scalp EEG. This patient had stereotyped movements captured on video with no epileptiform discharges on EEG. Unrecognized and untreated SHE may lead to serious injury. Diagnostic and confidence level criteria have been described by Tinipur et al. to support this important diagnosis in the absence of EEG-confirmed epileptiform activity. Video recording of episodes is a critical contributor to accurate diagnostic assessment of patients with abnormal movements in sleep. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, electroencephalographic abnormalities during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement sleep (spindles) were found to be predictive biomarkers of dementia. Because rapid eye movement sleep is regulated by the cholinergic system, which shows early degeneration in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment, anomalies during this sleep stage might mirror dementia development. In this prospective study, we examined baseline electroencephalographic absolute spectral power across three states of consciousness (non-rapid eye movement sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, and wakefulness) in 68 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 44 healthy controls. All participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recordings and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Power spectral analyses were performed on standard frequency bands. Dominant occipital frequency during wakefulness and ratios of slow-to-fast frequencies during rapid eye movement sleep and wakefulness were also computed. At follow-up (an average 4.5 years after baseline), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease had developed dementia and 50 patients remained dementia-free. In rapid eye movement sleep, patients with Parkinson's disease who later developed dementia showed, at baseline, higher absolute power in delta and theta bands and a higher slowing ratio, especially in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions, compared to patients who remained dementia-free and controls. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, lower baseline sigma power in parietal cortical regions also predicted development of dementia. During wakefulness, patients with Parkinson's disease who later developed dementia showed lower dominant occipital frequency as well as higher delta and slowing ratio compared to patients who remained dementia-free and controls. At baseline, higher slowing ratios in temporo-occipital regions during rapid eye movement sleep were associated with poor performance on visuospatial tests in patients with Parkinson's disease. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we found that best predictors of dementia in Parkinson's disease were rapid eye movement sleep slowing ratios in posterior regions, wakefulness slowing ratios in temporal areas, and lower dominant occipital frequency. These results suggest that electroencephalographic slowing during sleep is a new promising predictive biomarker for Parkinson's disease dementia, perhaps as a marker of cholinergic denervation. REM sleep is regulated by the cholinergic system, which shows early degeneration in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment. Latreille et al . reveal that EEG abnormalities during REM sleep predict subsequent dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease. These prodromal biomarkers will aid early diagnosis and identification of patients for neuroprotective trials.",

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), whether obstructive or central sleep apnoea or nocturnal hypoventilation, is by far the most common cause of sleep dysfunction in patients with neuromuscular diseases. The chapter summarises the symptoms that should alert the clinician to possible underlying sleep dysfunction. Diurnal tests, and nocturnal tests are both employed in the evaluation of patients with neuromuscular diseases and suspected sleep dysfunction. The chapter lists available treatment modalities for sleep dysfunction in neuromuscular diseases. Maintenance of adequate alveolar ventilation improves sleep continuity, prevents the long-term cardiovascular effects of chronic hypoxaemia, and improves daytime symptoms such as fatigue, sleepiness, headaches and cognitive dysfunction. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) eliminates obstructive events, normalises oxygen saturation and improves sleep continuity.",

      "title": "Sleep Bruxism in Children: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": ": Sleep bruxism, characterized by involuntary grinding or clenching of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible during sleep, is common in children. Sleep bruxism occurs while the patient is asleep. As such, diagnosis can be difficult as the affected child is usually unaware of the tooth grinding sounds. : This article aims to familiarize physicians with the diagnosis and management of sleep bruxism in children. : A search was conducted in May 2023 in PubMed Clinical Queries using the key terms “Bruxism” OR “Teeth grinding” AND “sleep”. The search strategy included all observational studies, clinical trials, and reviews published within the past 10 years. Only papers published in the English literature were included in this review. : According to the International classification of sleep disorders, the minimum criteria for the diagnosis of sleep bruxism are (1) the presence of frequent or regular (at least three nights per week for at least three months) tooth grinding sounds during sleep and (2) at least one or more of the following (a) abnormal tooth wear; (b) transient morning jaw muscle fatigue or pain; (c) temporary headache; or (d) jaw locking on awaking. According to the International Consensus on the assessment of bruxism, “possible” sleep bruxism can be diagnosed based on self-report or report from family members of tooth-grinding sounds during sleep; “probable” sleep bruxism based on self-report or report from family members of tooth-grinding sounds during sleep plus clinical findings suggestive of bruxism (e.g., abnormal tooth wear, hypertrophy and/or tenderness of masseter muscles, or tongue/lip indentation); and “definite” sleep bruxism based on the history and clinical findings and confirmation by polysomnography, preferably combined with video and audio recording. Although polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep bruxism, because of the high cost, lengthy time involvement, and the need for high levels of technical competence, polysomnography is not available for use in most clinical settings. On the other hand, since sleep bruxism occurs while the patient is asleep, diagnosis can be difficult as the affected child is usually unaware of the tooth grinding sounds. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of sleep bruxism is often based on the history (e.g., reports of grinding noises during sleep) and clinical findings (e.g., tooth wear, hypertrophy and/or tenderness of masseter muscles). : In childhood, sleep-bruxism is typically self-limited and does not require specific treatment. Causative or triggering factors should be eliminated if possible. The importance of sleep hygiene cannot be over-emphasized. Bedtime should be relaxed and enjoyable. Mental stimulation and physical activity should be limited before going to bed. For adults with frequent and severe sleep bruxism who do not respond to the above measures, oral devices can be considered to protect teeth from further damage during bruxism episodes. As the orofacial structures are still developing in the pediatric age group, the benefits and risks of using oral devices should be taken into consideration. Pharmacotherapy is not a favorable option and is rarely used in children. Current evidence on the effective interventions for the management of sleep bruxism in children is inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for specific treatment at this time.",

Idiopathic RBD patients, especially those with abnormal dopamine transporter uptake imaging, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra, hyposmia and color vision damage are those with high risk to develop PD, DLB and MSA. RBD may not be considered as a parasomnia but rather as an integral part of a neurodegenerative disease. Clonazepam (0.5-4 mg) and melatonin (3-12 mg) at bed time improve the symptoms of RBD but does not prevent the conversion to a neurodegenerative disease.",

Sleeping disorders are reported in more than 50% of children with ADHD. On the other hand, symptoms of sleep disorder, inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness can imitate the symptoms of ADHD. We describe a 5(1/2)-year-old boy with symptoms of attention deficit and social withdrawal. His sleep was disturbed, with late sleep onset and frequent awakening during the night. After correction of his sleep pattern, the symptoms of attention deficit and social withdrawal disappeared.",

The results differentiated fibrositis patients from normal controls in terms of SCL-90R scores, with fibrositis patients showing significantly more psychopathology. Fibrositis patients had more alpha EEG sleep and less REM and Stage 1 sleep. They were better able to recall their behaviourally signalled awakenings the following morning and reported qualitatively less satisfying sleep than the normal controls. The alpha EEG sleep anomaly may reflect a vigilant arousal state during nocturnal sleep and result in the daytime experience of unrefreshing sleep, psychologic distress, that re-enforces the perpetuation of the sleep-related symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is one of the most common clinical syndromes of somnological disorders, including any sleep disorders under sufficient time and appropriate sleeping conditions. Significant sleep disturbances are common in children who enter the intensive care unit. Between 18 and 65 per cent of children aged between 2 and 18 hospitalized in the intensive care unit have a clinical condition of acute confusion, better known as delirium. Sleep fragmentation, reduction of total sleep time, lack of slow, deep sleep and rapid sleep, and shift of sleep time are changes that can also act as insomnia triggers. Their presence worsens the course of the disease in the patient, prolongs the hospital stay, and increases the risk of complications and lethality. Circadian sleep disorder is a condition that requires close monitoring. Although insomnia therapy approaches are not yet reliable, early diagnosis of insomnia can reduce the duration of the delirium. Sleep assessment includes questionnaires and diaries. However, it was recognized that, despite the difficulties in implementing and interpreting polysomnography, it was still a gold standard for more accurate detection of changes in sleep phases and the difference between normal and abnormal sleep. In the absence of a polysomnograph, it is permissible to use a prolonged video assisted EEG. The inventive multimodal video-assisted monitoring method makes it possible to diagnose sleep disorders, pain syndrome and differential diagnosis of apnoea with cardiac and conductivity disorders or abnormal brain activity, including the presence of sub-clinical convulsions in patients of high-risk groups using a safe and non-invasive method for analyzing trends in the total bioelectric activity of different biological structures of a child. The validation of questionnaires according to the age of the child is also an important step in the timely diagnosis of sleep disorders in older children.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6.

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

In this review, the focus will be a subgroup of patients: adult non-obese subjects with OSA and their specific features. In non-obese OSA patients (patients with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m 2 ), there are specific polysomnographic features which reflect specific pathophysiological traits. Previous authors identified an anatomical factor (cranial anatomical factors, retrognatia, etc.) in OSA non-obese. We have hypothesized that in this subgroup of patients, there could be a non-anatomical pathological prevalent trait. Little evidence exists regarding the role of low arousal threshold. This factor could explain the difficulty in treating OSA in non-obese patients and emphasizes the importance of a specific therapeutic approach for each patient.",

As such, they are a part of all contemporary sets of diagnostic criteria for major depression and of all major symptom-based rating scales for depression. Insomnia is a particularly frequent complaint, and it is reported by more than 90% of depressed patients. Although the \"kindling\" or \"illness transduction\" model of depression remains hypothetical, there is evidence that people with recurrent depression have more pronounced abnormalities of sleep neurophysiology than those experiencing a single or initial episode. Therefore, early relief of insomnia in a depressed patient, in addition to alleviating other symptoms, may increase adherence to treatment and increase daytime performance and overall functioning, while complete relief of insomnia may improve prognosis. Stimulation of serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors is thought to underlie insomnia and changes in sleep architecture seen with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). This is the reason why hypnotics or low-dose trazodone are commonly coprescribed at the initiation of the treatment with either the SSRIs or SNRIs. On the other hand, antidepressant drugs with 5-HT2 blocking properties, such as mirtazapine or nefazodone, alleviate insomnia and improve sleep architecture. In depressed patients, mirtazapine produces a significant shortening of sleep-onset latency, increases a total sleep time, and leads to a marked improvement in sleep efficiency. Antidepressants with preferential 5-HT2 blocking properties are therefore a good treatment option for depressed patients with marked insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Snoring is the audible consequence of the pharyngeal airway collapsing when one inspires. Snoring can disrupt sleep, cause a variety of important but nonspecific symptoms, and suggest the presence of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which can lead to cor pulmonale and sudden death. Therefore, the review of systems for a child at any age should include questions regarding snoring and breathing during sleep. Most normal children snore at one time or another, and many, particularly those who have nasal allergies, snore almost nightly. Pediatricians should be able to identify which snoring children do not require treatment or referral, which are candidates for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, and which should be referred for polysomnography (sleep study) or more specialized evaluation. Physiologic Sources of the Problem Snoring and obstructive sleep apnea do not represent structural upper airway narrowing alone, but rather an imbalance between the degree of airway narrowing and the ability of the respiratory centers in the brainstem to use the muscles of the pharynx and tongue to maintain airway patency. For each child who has tonsillar hypertrophy and who snores, there are many who have larger tonsils who do not snore because they use their pharyngeal muscles to keep the airway open during sleep.",

The pathophysiology of PLMS is still not understood, but recent studies indicate a hypoactivity of the dopaminergic system in subjects with PLMS. In the present study, we investigated the intrasubject variance of PLMS from one night to the other because a fluctuation in the number of PLMS may influence the outcome of pharmacologic and pathophysiologic studies.Retrospective observational study.Data collection occurred in the sleep disorders unit.Sleep electroencephalogram and PLMS data of 115 patients with PLMS monitoring over 2 consecutive nights were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were grouped into the following diagnostic categories: restless legs syndrome, insomnia secondary to a psychiatric disorder, primary insomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, and narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.N/A.In 27% of the entire patient population, we found a considerable variability of the PLMS index (difference between nights > 10/hour) and, in 19% of patients, variability of the PLMS arousal index (difference between nights > 5/hour) across the 2 investigated nights. The intraindividual variance occurred most frequently and to the highest extent in patients with RLS.The variability of PLMS indexes should considered if the PLMS recording is performed in support of the clinical diagnosis or in the interpretation of studies investigating drug efficacy. Furthermore, the variability of PLMS may be an indicator of an instability of the dopaminergic system that should be taken into account in studies investigating central nervous system dopaminergic activity.",

Describe the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of apnea.\n\n3. Characterize the findings of long-term follow-up of infants who have apnea.\n\nAlthough apnea typically results from immaturity of the respiratory control system (see accompanying article in this issue), it also may be the presenting sign of other diseases or pathophysiologic states that frequently affect preterm infants. A thorough consideration of possible causes is always warranted, especially when there is an unexpected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea or bradycardia (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \nMultiple etiologic factors that may contribute to apnea in preterm infants. IVH=intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n\n\nCentral nervous system problems, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, can precipitate apnea in the preterm infant. Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression. Other disease states that may precipitate apnea include metabolic disorders such as …",

      "abstract": "Summary Neurological involvement occurred in every one of a series of 30 patients with an insulinoma. The episodic nature of the hypoglycaemia caused symptoms and signs to fluctuate and often led to delay in diagnosis (mean length of history was 3 years). The commonest feature at first presentation was confusion (20 instances), but as the illness evolved, coma (16 instances) and convulsions (8 instances) became more frequent. Objective weakness was found in 7 patients, with 3 examples of hemiparesis and 2 each of paraparesis and monoparesis; in all, the weakness resolved over a period of 1 hr to 3 days when normoglycaemia was maintained. Other neurological features included subjective visual disturbances, headache, dysarthria and ataxia. 220 patients with an insulinoma from 7 series in the literature were reviewed. The high incidence of neurological features was confirmed, with confusion (152 cases), coma (82 cases) and convulsions (58 cases) predominating. Visual disturbances were common, though not accurately quantified in some series. Objective evidence of weakness on the other hand was reported in only 6 of the 222 patients. Other less common symptoms included headache (18 instances) and peripheral paraesthesiae (14 instances). In the 7 series reviewed, as in our own, it was found that in any one patient, each episode of hypoglycaemia was accompanied by the same symptom complex. The presence of an insulinoma should be considered in any patient with unusual, or inexplicable neurological features, particularly when they are intermittent. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating an inappropriately high circulating insulin level, for the ambient blood glucose concentration.",

      "abstract": "When sleep duration and mood were monitored longitudinally in a 59–year-old woman with bipolar illness, sleep loss appeared to mediate the triggering of mania by psychosocial and pharmacological precipitating factors. This interpretation was supported by observations that mania could repeatedly be induced experimentally by depriving her of sleep for one night. The patient's data illustrate how sleep-loss might be a preventable cause of mania in a variety of situations.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychological deficits have been documented in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSSA). Both nocturnal hypoxemia and impairment of daytime vigilance have been suggested as the pathogenesis of these deficits, yet it remains difficult to find good correlations between cognitive deficits and either of these physiological parameters. In the present study, 10 normal controls were compared to 10 moderately and 10 severely apneic patients, all recorded in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights, with a vigilance and neuropsychological assessment made during the intervening day. Relative to the controls, moderate and severe OSAS showed differences in many cognitive functions, although the severely affected showed the greater differences. Moreover, severe apneics were also worse than moderate apneics on tests that were found to be normal in the latter group. This suggests a discontinuity in the appearance of neuropsychological deficits as OSAS progresses. Further analyses revealed that reductions in general intellectual measures, as well as in executive and psychomotor tasks were all attributable to the severity of hypoxemia, while other attention and memory deficits were related to vigilance impairment. Therefore, both vigilance impairment and nocturnal hypoxemia may differentially contribute to the cognitive dysfunctions found in OSAS.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness are the most common sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease. This study aims at better understanding how severity of PD motor and non-motor features and dopaminergic treatments contribute to these sleep symptoms in the first decade of PD. Data from a community-based cohort of PD patients was used to model cross-sectional PD-related risk factors for insomnia and EDS sleep scores using linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, and PD duration. Longitudinal changes in sleep scores were assessed with paired t-tests. For 481 patients who completed the MOS-Sleep questionnaire at least once, high levodopa daily doses (500mg+) and severe autonomic and complex non-motor symptoms (depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations and dopamine dysregulation syndrome) were associated with both EDS and insomnia symptoms. Higher total motor UPDRS and especially tremor sub-scores and motor complications were associated only with insomnia, while axial/posture/gait and body bradykinesia UPDRS sub-scores were associated only with EDS. In 156 patients, with a second sleep measure on average after 2.2 years of follow-up, only EDS scores increased over time. Groups defined by worse PD features severity at first follow-up (UPDRS 35+, PD duration 6.5+ years, or LED 500mg+) had larger average increases in EDS score over time. These findings provide evidence that motor and non-motor dysfunction in PD are associated with insomnia and EDS symptoms, but specific features and level of severity affect sleep symptoms differently. Motor manifestations related to tremor and dyskinesia are associated with sleep quantity and quality, measured by insomnia symptoms, while axial motor features are related to EDS symptoms.",

      "title": "Oropharyngeal Airway Three-dimensional Changes after Treatment with Myobrace in Class II Retrognathic Children.",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor-in-ChiefSeveral scholars pointed out the relationship between the function of muscle and teeth (1). The effects of breathing on facial growth and occlusion of the bite have been identified in various papers (2, 3). A breathing disorder occurs after upper airway blockage during sleep, it has not only nighttime symptoms such as snoring or apnea but also daytime symptoms such as behavioral disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness, concentration issue, memory, and cognitive function. Sleep is a physiological phenomenon essential for performing basic human functions and is important for normal growth and development, and for maintaining emotional health and immunity. Among various sleep disorders, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common medical problem for children (4). Among the sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in Korean children and adolescents based on polysomnography, relative to other sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing can be prevented myofunctional therapy, the neuromuscular toning and re-education of oral, facial, and pharyngeal muscles (lips, tongue, cheeks, face, and throat) through a series of activities which helps normalize the developing or developed, head and neck structures and function, with orthodontic treatment (5,6). A recent research literature review shows myofunctional therapy for those whose tongues block their airway during sleep can reduce these choking events by approximately 50% in adults and 62% in children and those lowest blood oxygen saturations, snoring, and sleepiness outcomes improve in adults (7).We now have the evidence-based studies to validate the success of treating patients collaboratively with a variety of disorders (e.g., orthodontic disorders, sleep apnea, orofacial pain) but, until recently, there were not enough studies using oral appliance and myofunctional therapy of Korean children and adolescents. Since cephalometric radiography was introduced by Broadbent to evaluate the craniofacial morphology, as recently reported (8), to evaluate the size of the airways and tongue in patients with sleep apnea, it is widely used, but, not be evaluated in three dimensions.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful nondestructive method for 3D reconstruction that can be used to visualize and measure the morphological structures of hard and soft tissue on face. 3D models reconstructed from CBCT and tomographic images can display the precise anatomical structure of Oropharyngeal space. In addition, CBCT is useful for establishing realtime clinical diagnoses of patients and treatment plans (9). Programs that accurately measure complex structures of 3D models mathematically are available, but no studies have attempted to measure the Oropharyngeal space area using CBCT technology. So, our study was conducted to evaluate three dimensional changes after Myobrace (Myofunctional Research Co, Australia) appliance treatment for the children with OSAS symptoms (Fig. 1, 2). Our study confirmed the increase of oropharyneal airway dimension using Myobrace (Fig. 3). We excluded the sleep symptoms of the participating patients.Although the majority of childhood obstructive sleep apnea is due to hypertrophy of adnexaadenoid, there is no correlation between the magnitude of hypertrophy and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. …",

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A polygraphic study has been performed during the night‐and‐day spontaneous sleep in one case of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica. The various nyctemeral cycles proved to be greatly disorganized with a complete lack of the paradoxical sleep phase. During the night recordings two types of seizures have been recorded: (1) myoclonic generalized seizures with EEG multiple spike‐and‐waves, generally appearing at the end of each nyctemeral cycle; and (2) tonic seizures with a desynchronized EEG, appearing only in the first stages of sleep. On the basis of physio‐pathological considerations one may suppose that the lack of paradoxical sleep and the appearance of myoclonic generalized seizures are phenomena connected with one another and particularly that the seizures represent the equivalent of the paradoxical sleep. The existence of tonic seizures with a desynchronized EEG and the results of Amytal injection into the vertebral artery let one think that the epileptogenic focus is localized in the lower brain stem, likewise in the structures, still unknown in man, interested in the genesis of the paradoxical sleep. RÉSUMÉ Une étude polygraphique du sommeil spontané de jour et de nuit a été faite dans un cas de dyssynergie cérébelleuse myoclonique. Les différents cycles nycthémériques se sont montrés grandement désorganisés avec une absence complète de phase paradoxale du sommeil. Pendant les enregistrements nocturnes deux types de crises ont été enregistrés: crises myocloniques généralisées avec décharges de poly‐pointes‐ondes sur l'E.E.G., survenant généralement à la fin de chaque cycle nycthémérique, et crises toniques avec désynchronisation de l'E.E.G., survenant seulement dans les premieres phases du sommeil. Sur la base de considérations physio‐pathologiques on peut supposer que le manque de sommeil paradoxal et la survenue de crises myocloniques généralisées sont des phénomènes liés entre eux et, plus particulièrement, que les crises représentent l'équivalent du sommeil paradoxal. L'existence de crises toniques avec désynchronisation à l'E.E.G. et les effets de l'injection d'Amytal dans l'artère vertébrate font au surplus supposer que le foyer épileptogene est situé dans le tronc cérébral inférieur, c.‐à‐d. probablement dans des structures, encore inconnues chez l'homme, qui sont intéressées dans la genèse du sommeil paradoxal.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are important diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of many common psychiatric syndromes. Clinicians have to be content with the patients' own assessment of their sleep patterns, or at the best, those of a night nurse; both methods are known to be unreliable, particularly where insomnia is present (Kuper et al. , 1970). In a previous paper, Johnson and Kitching (1972) described a simple device for assessing the duration of sleep in ward situations. It depended upon the patient's ability to signal wakefulness by pressing a mechanical switch in response to an intermittent light stimulus throughout the night. This was considered to indicate a level of cerebral arousal compatible with wakefulness: failure to respond to the light stimulus indicated that the patient's level of cerebral arousal was lowered to the level of ‘sleep‘. A number of objections were anticipated, however, which might invalidate these assumptions. Most important of these were: (i) The intermittent occurrence of the light stimulus, every 15–20 minutes, limits the device to an approximation of the duration of sleep. The system of scoring was to assume a period of 10 minutes of sleep on either side of a missed stimulus. (ii) The possibility that the patient could press the mechanical switch in response to the light stimulus whilst in Stage I or even Stage II of sleep (Rechtschaffen et al. , 1968) without returning to wakefulness. (iii) The intermittent light stimulus might itself act as a disruptive stimulus to sleep, producing arousal and thus altering the sleep level.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the requirements for sleep do not appear to decline with aging, the ability to sleep and achieve consolidated sleep may decrease in some older adults. Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Disordered sleep affects daytime health and behavioral functioning in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric conditions, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are no exception. Treatment of sleep disorders in this population may not only improve sleep, but daytime behavior and autism symptoms as well. Furthermore, treatment of sleep problems in children with developmental disabilities and challenging daytime behavior may reduce parental stress and heighten their sense of control and ability to cope with their child's sleep. The causes of disrupted sleep in ASD are discussed in a separate chapter (chap. 24); this chapter will emphasize non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options to promote sleep. Two points should be emphasized. First, defining the cause of the sleep disturbance is critical to appropriate intervention. For example insomnia due to poor sleep hygiene may be responsive to behavioral interventions, insomnia due to impaired circadian control of sleep may be responsive to treatment with supplemental melatonin or light, daytime sleepiness due to obstructive sleep apnea should respond to treatment with adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and nocturnal events due to epileptic seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs. Second, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments often go hand-in-hand in the treatment of sleep disturbances in ASD. Whenever possible, behavioral treatments, which provide the foundation for proper sleep, should precede pharmacologic treatments to minimize adverse effects and maximize benefits achieved from pharmacologic treatments (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "Hypnic headache is an infrequent type of primary headache characterised by appearing almost exclusively during sleep and by waking the patient up. The pain is dull (generally bilateral), is not associated to autonomic signs and usually appears from the age of 50 onwards.A 10-year prospective study was conducted which describes the patients with hypnic headache who were attended in a specialised headache clinic. Data collected include demographic variables, the characteristics of the pain and response to treatment. Data from males and from females were compared.Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with hypnic headache: 15 females and 9 males. There were no differences between sexes as regards the age at onset of the pain, the time elapsed until diagnosis, the number of episodes per month or the amount of time the pain lasted. The males reported a more intense pain (measured by means of the analogical visual scale) than the females. Neither were there any differences in terms of the presence of arterial hypertension or obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Response to different symptomatic and preventive treatments was scarce and with no differences between sexes.The pain in hypnic headaches is more intense in males, although this needs to be corroborated in longer series. Further advances need to be made in the pathophysiology of this kind of headache so as to be able to find more efficient preventive pharmacological agents.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome is defined when five or more central apneas and/or hypopneas are present per hour of sleep, more than 50% of all respiratory events. CSA usually occur during NREM stage and rarely during REM. CSA is important to recognize because of complications ranging from frequent nighttime awakenings,sleepiness to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We present a 40 year old female patient with rare CSA during REM sleep and dream enactment. Report of Case 40yo African American female with history of loud snoring, witnessed sleep apnea, and daytime fatigue. She reported nightmares, sleep talking, and acting out her dreams without injury. Epworth sleepiness score was 5 /24. Her past medical history is significant for depression and anxiety. She has no history of head trauma, no neurologic or cardiovascular disorders. Her medications include fluoxetine and,quetiapine. She denied substance use, narcotic use, or alcohol use. Her level 1 sleep study showed predominantly REM-associated central sleep apneas which is rare. She also was observed to have loss of REM sleep muscle atonia suggestive of REM Behavior disorder. Her sleep architecture was atypical with decreased N3 sleep stage. REM sleep duration was adequate. She was noted to have loss of REM muscle atonia based on AASM guidelins elevated chin EMG, excessive transient muscle activity, and witnessed movement during REM stage via video monitoring. During the study, she had an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 13.1 per hour of sleep, Central apneas were predominantly noted during REM stage, 10 per hour, comprised of 50% of her respiratory events. The minimum SpO2 value with CSA was 94%. She had normal sinus rhythm. Her sleep was fragmented. A total arousals were 28.4/hour,and 7.9/hour were respiratory arousals, and the rest were spontaneous arousals. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 %. Her room air arterial blood gas was normal with PaC02 of 37 mmHg. MRI of the brain/brainstem was ordered given her atypical REM sleep. She had no acute intracranial abnormalities. There is a non specific finding of a low lying cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari I malformation. Conclusion Our patient has rare idiopathic central apnea in REM stage and is third case reported. She also has loss of muscle atonia during REM with dream enactment which is also rare in her age group. Injury precaution advised.",

      "abstract": "Shift work sleep disorder is a common problem in industrialized countries because of the need for occupations and services to continue to function 24 hours/day. Approximately 20% of employed adults in the United States are engaged in shift work. Shift work sleep disorder is diagnosed if there is a report of insomnia or excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. Shift work is associated with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, and it has been implicated in weight gain and cognitive impairment. There is evidence of increased absenteeism in night workers compared with day workers. A planned sleep schedule, timed bright light exposure, timed melatonin administration, and stimulants or drugs promoting alertness can be used to manage shift work sleep disorder. Jet lag is characterized by a misalignment between internal circadian rhythms and local time caused by rapid travel across at least two time zones. Not all travelers experience jet lag; risk factors include age, number of time zones crossed, and circadian preference. Management includes timed melatonin along with optional timed and dosed bright light exposure.",

      "title": "Jet Lag, Sleep Timing, and Sleep Inertia",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores the causes, consequences, and countermeasures of jet lag, mistimed sleep, and sleep inertia. Jet lag can occur when rapidly crossing multiple time zones (e.g., trans-meridian travel for long-haul pilots). The desynchrony between the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, and the new day-night cycle can lead to indigestion, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Mistimed sleep can also occur within a time zone. In the case of night shiftwork, sleep is displaced to the daytime which leads to poor sleep and increased fatigue at night due to the combination of pressures from the two-process model of sleep regulation: sleep loss (homeostatic pressure) and being awake when the body is promoting sleep (circadian pressure). There is also a third process of sleep regulation called sleep inertia, which refers to the brief period of fatigue and impaired cognitive performance experienced after waking. Sleep inertia can be a fatigue risk for transportation workers who work on-call (e.g., emergency services) or who nap on shift (e.g., long-haul truck drivers) and are required to perform a safety-critical task soon after waking. For each of these fatigue risks, strategic exposure to bright light can be used to help realign sleep timing and to promote alertness.",

Despite this, people sleep less and less due to different factors including economic activities, work stress, social demand, erroneous beliefs about sleep, excessive use of electronic devices, long hours of work or rotating shifts, and such circumstances generate conditions in which people sleep less than 7 hours a day, well, sleeping less than 7 hours a day is considered as sleep restriction and restricting sleep only a couple of hours per night can lead to deterioration in health and quality of life, producing a significant decrease in cognitive performance. When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons.Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis-nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

Limb movements or other behaviors during sleep are not always seizure-related. Some parasomnias such as sleep enuresis, somnambulism, and somniloquy are more common in children. Sleep terrors, nightmares and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder can be confused with seizures. A careful history can often help differentiate between seizures and parasomnias, but in many cases polysomnography and/or video-EEG is required for definitive characterization. As the approach to treatment can be different, it is important to correctly diagnose the condition.",

      "abstract": "A sindrome da apneia/hipoapneia obstrutiva do sono (SAHOS), ocorre devido a obstrucao total (apneia) e/ou parcial (hipoapneia) das vias aereas superiores por, no minimo dez segundos, durante o sono. Podendo estar associada a interrupcao do mesmo e a reducao da saturacao da oxihemoglobina. O proposito dessa revisao e conhecer melhor as causas relacionados a sindrome e suas associacoes com os fatores de risco. Por meio da analise 33 artigos sobre Sindrome da Apneia Obstrutiva do Sono no periodo de 2002 a 2015 retirados das bases de dados Lilacs,  SciELO, MedLine e Google Academico. Sua etiologia esta ligada a diversas causas como alteracoes anatomicas, endocrinas, neuromotoras e condicoes fisiologicas do individuo. Dentre os fatores predisponentes para a sindrome o mais significativo e a obesidade, alem disso, o sexo e a idade tambem interferem de maneira importante. Sendo que SAHOS e mais comum em homens e em pessoas de idade mais avancada, no entanto apos os 55 anos, enquanto os homens apresentam um discreto aumento, as mulheres praticamente dobram o Indice de Apneia e Hipoapneia. Conclui-se que a etiologia e multifatorial, sendo a obesidade a causa mais comum, a faixa etaria mais acometida e apos os 50 anos, assim como, sexo feminino.",

      "abstract": "Research addressing comorbid insomnia with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (COMISA) has been conducted in two different ways—firstly, looking for the insomnia among subjects with OSA and secondly, assessment of OSA among subjects with chronic insomnia. This research has shown that prevalence of insomnia among subjects with OSA is higher than the prevalence of OSA among subjects with insomnia. While investigated through polysomnography, subjects with pure insomnia and COMISA show shorter total sleep time, greater percentage of wake after sleep onset and, poorer sleep efficiency compared to subjects having OSA and normal controls. Patients with COMISA suffer from two disorders and this combination is likely to produce greater disability and poorer quality of life among them compared to patients with either disorders alone. Pathophysiological models based on the scientific evidences favor that (i) OSA may lead to insomnia, (ii) insomnia may also lead to OSA and both can work in feed forward manner to develop COMISA. Insomnia is difficult to be diagnosed in the presence of other sleep disorders including OSA. It needs to be remembered that overlap of symptoms between OSA and insomnia may have a positive influence the diagnosis of either disorders before and, even after the treatment of both the disorders making the diagnosis difficult. A number of other challenges also make diagnosis of COMISA difficult that include physician's knowledge of all versus selected sleep disorders and, methods of assessment of sleep disorders. In view of limited literature, no consensus exists on the management of cases having COMISA. However, available evidences suggest that concurrent therapy (CBTi with PAP) could be better than sequential therapies where management of one disorder is followed by other.",

      "title": "1218 REM Sleep Onset During Cataplexy: An Unusual Manifestation in a Patient with Narcolepsy and Intracranial Hypertension",
      "abstract": "Type 1 narcolepsy is a disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy, an abrupt and transient episode of muscle weakness in the setting of consciousness typically precipitated by emotions. Deficiency of the hypocretin-orexin axis is common in human type 1 narcolepsy. EDS typically precedes cataplexy by several years in type 1 narcolepsy. It is atypical for narcoleptics to enter sleep in the course of cataplexy. We present an unusual course of cataplexy where the muscle atonia of cataplexy evolves into physiologically documented REM sleep. A 20-year-old morbidly obese female (BMI 41.09kg/m2) seropositive for HLA DQB1*0602 presented to the sleep clinic with 3 to 5 daily episodes of muscle atonia/sleep attacks episodes provoked by emotions and excessive daytime sleepiness (sleeping 10 hours per day, Epworth 18), with onset 02/2016 and 2005, respectively. Past history is remarkable for postural orthostatic tachycardia, migraines, and intracranial hypertension (ICH) with functional ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted 08/23/16. She was not taking psychoactive agents. On examination she had abrupt loss of muscle tone followed shortly by visible REM. She was conscious for the initial portion of the seven minutes before restoration of muscle tone. A 16 lead EEG during an unprovoked atonia/sleep attack was negative for epilepsy. Overnight polysomnography revealed a total sleep time of 495.5 minutes, apnea hypopnea index 2.5, and respiratory disturbance index 2.8. Multiple sleep latency test had mean sleep latency of 2.25 minutes and sleep onset REM in 4 of 5 naps. Laughter provoked atonia was captured after the 5th nap with EEG prompt transition to REM sleep (video and EEG tracings available). Sodium Oxybate therapy proved effective in increasing alertness and reducing episodes of atonia/sleep attacks. Cataplexy evolving to REM sleep is an atypical feature of this case. ICH may have played a facilitating role in this case.",

      "title": "Non-24-Hour Sleep–Wake Rhythm Disorder in the Totally Blind: Diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Many aspects of human physiology and behaviour are dominated by 24-hour circadian rhythms that have a major impact on our health and well-being. These include the sleep-wake cycle, alertness and performance patterns, and many daily hormone profiles. The rhythms are spontaneously generated by an internal \"pacemaker\", the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the anterior hypothalamus. This master clock has, for most humans, an intrinsic rhythm slightly longer than 24 hours. Daily retinal light exposure is required to keep these circadian rhythms synchronized with the external 24-hour solar environment. This daily synchronization process generally poses no problems for sighted individuals although they experience some of the consequences of circadian desynchrony when \"jetlagged\" or working night shifts. However, many blind people with no perception of light experience periodical circadian desynchrony. This is due to the absence of light information to the hypothalamic circadian clock, resulting in poor synchronisationsynchronization of circadian rhythms. Affected patients experience cyclical or periodic episodes of poor sleep and daytime dysfunction, severely interfering with social, academic and professional life. The diagnosis of Non-24 Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder Syndrome, also named free-running disorder, non-entrained disorder or hypernycthemeral syndrome remains challenging from a clinical point of view due to the cyclical symptoms and should be confirmed by measurements of circadian biomarkers such as urinary melatonin to demonstrate a circadian period outside the normal range. Management includes behavioural modification and melatonin. Tasimelteon, a novel melatonin receptor 1 and 2 agonist, has demonstrated its effectiveness and safety with an evening dose of 20 mg in and is currently the only treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA.",

Reduced or completely absent central respiratory drive without upper airway obstruction is the common feature of central SRBD. Hypoventilation syndromes most often occur secondary in patients with neuromuscular, pulmonary or sceletal diseases or in patients with massive obesity. In patients with hypoventilation during sleep nocturnal and exertional dyspnea and headaches are frequently reported symptoms. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the key symptom in patients with central sleep apnea syndrome. Cheyne-Stokes Respiration is frequent in heart failure patients but in many cases does not cause symptoms specific for the breathing disorder. If there are symptoms or if ambulatory recording of breathing during sleep suggests a sleep related breathing disorder, polysomnography is then performed to definitively rule out or confirm the diagnosis and to initiate treatment, if needed. The indication for treatment in asymptomatic patients with central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes Respiration may be difficult, as there are very little data concerning the long-term benefit in these patients. Symptomatic patients and those with severe central sleep apnea should be treated. Oxygen and CPAP may be effective in 20-30% of patients each. If these treatment options are ineffective, non-invasive pressure support ventilaiton can be used. In patients suffering from hypoventilation syndromes the treatment of choice is non-invasive pressure support ventilaiton combined with supplemental oxygen, if required.",

      "title": "0863 A Unique case of sleep state misperception in an elderly patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Insomnia is a widespread condition, especially in the elderly population. While the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) third edition appropriately removed primary insomnia subtypes from the classification, our case illustrates the importance of these factors in considering a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis. We present a case of severe subjective insomnia with no apparent objective findings, instead with evidence of excellent sleep efficiency on the contrary. Report of Cases: A 76-year-old male with a past medical history of anxiety and a recent diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease presented to the Sleep medicine clinic with two years of insomnia which started after his retirement. The patient felt difficulty with falling asleep every night. He underwent a sleep study and was found to have sleep-disordered breathing, which responded well to Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy. However, insomnia symptoms persisted and were resistant to multiple medications, including Mirtazapine, Melatonin, and Suvorexant. He was referred for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with minimal to no improvement in his symptoms. Conversely, a one-week Actigraphy recording on Bipap therapy surprisingly revealed an excellent sleep efficiency with near-continuous seven to eight hours of sleep every night. The etiology of chronic insomnia is poorly understood but is typically multifactorial, as described in the second edition of ICSD. In this case, paradoxical insomnia played a significant role in the patient's clinical presentation. Paradoxical insomnia is defined as thoughts or perceptions of time asleep as wakefulness, with objective measures documenting normative amounts of sleep. Previous work suggests that alterations in the sleep/arousal system may contribute to this apparent mismatch between conventional objective sleep measures and subjective reports. Conclusion This case demonstrates the challenge of effectively diagnosing and managing chronic insomnia. While the new classification guidelines from the ICSD appropriately remove insomnia subtypes from the diagnostic paradigm, familiarity with these previously described subtypes may aid clinical decisions. Crucial to this discussion is that previously described \"secondary\" or \"subtypes\" of primary insomnia may develop an independent clinical course that may require further attention. Support (If Any) ICSD 2nd,3rd editions.",

      "title": "Understanding the pathophysiology of insomnia (Anidra) with special reference to primary insomnia using neurotransmitter sleep theories: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a primordial requirement for human sustenance and its role in health is inevitable. Despite its importance, inadequate sleep is one of the most common complaints across the globe. Ayurveda identifies Nidra (sleep) as one of the three supporting pillars of life and attributes its maintenance not only to health but also to longevity and prosperity; in contrast, Anidra (disturbed sleep) is one of the contributing factors for disease. Ayurveda clearly identifies the factors in Anidra which are vitiation of Pitta or Vata (fundamental humors of the body), Manasantapa (psycho-social stress), Kshaya (debilitating factors), or Abhighata (injury/trauma). Insomnia is characterized by reduced quality or quantity of sleep and has effects on the quality of life of the affected individual. It can be the difficulty of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening, which can have a significant impact on the daily activity of the individual. The contemporary science is yet to give a definite theory for the physiology of sleep and the pathophysiology of insomnia. The most widely accepted and researched concept is the role of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, melatonin and their effects in the regulation of sleep–wake cycle. These neurotransmitters and their effect on sleep physiology and pathology of insomnia need to be further explored in order to improve its management strategies. Hence, this review aims to determine the possible relation between the concepts of Nidra (sleep) and Anidra (disturbed sleep) mentioned in Ayurveda and these neurotransmitter sleep theories. This will help in improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia, developing Ayurveda management protocols for insomnia, and also in explaining the pharmacodynamics of Ayurveda drugs better. The method used for review is by sourcing and analyzing the available data from Ayurveda and contemporary literature on the topic in discussion.",

      "abstract": "The primary pathological event in the disorder obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the partial or complete closure of the pharyngeal airway during sleep in an individual with a widely patent airway during wakefulness. This yields an apnea or hypopnea with resulting hypoxia and hypercapnia, and most often requires an arousal to terminate the event. These events occur in a repetitive manner during sleep, yielding intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation with their associated adverse effects on the health and quality of life of the afflicted individual. Here, we focus on the events leading up to these apneas and hypopneas, primarily addressing pharyngeal anatomy, upper airway muscle control, the respiratory arousal threshold, and ventilatory control instability in OSA pathophysiology.",

They were met by five of ten trained, highly susceptible Ss. Normal sleep can apparently occur parallel with hypnosis, without interfering with it.

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "abstract": "LeGros TL, Murphy-Lavoie H. Hyperbaric Treatment of Air or Gas Embolism: Current Recommendations. Undersea Hyperb Med. 2024 Fourth Quarter; 51(4):425-448. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) presents as the abrupt onset of hearing loss. Approximately 88% of SSNHL has no identifiable etiology and is termed idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) [1]. Hearing specialists have investigated ISSHL since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, more than 800 articles, or one every two weeks, have been published in the English medical literature [2]. ISSHL is the abrupt onset of hearing loss, usually unilaterally and upon wakening, that involves a hearing loss of at least 30 decibels (dB) occurring within three days over at least three contiguous frequencies [3-4]. As most patients do not present with premorbid audiograms, the degree of hearing loss is usually defined by the presentation thresholds of the unaffected ear [4]. Other associated symptoms include tinnitus, aural fullness, dizziness and vertigo [4-5]. The historical incidence of ISSHL ranges from 5–20 cases/100,000 population, with approximately 4,000 new cases per annum in the United States [4,6]. The true incidence is thought to be higher, as ISSHL is thought to be underreported. Interestingly, 4,000 cases annually calculate to 1.3 cases/ 100,000 in the United States; therefore, an incidence of 5–20/100,000 would translate to &gt; 15,000 new ISSHL cases per annum in the United States. Recent literature has placed the annual ISSHL incidence in the United States as 27 cases/100,000, with a pediatric incidence of 11 cases/100,000 [7]. Other studies report that the incidence is increasing (160/100,000), especially in the elderly (77/100,000), and conclude that ISSHL is no longer rare [7-9]. In 1984, Byl reviewed the literature and found the mean age of ISSHL presentation to be 46–49 years, with variation of incidence with age and an equal gender distribution [6,10-13]. The presentation of ISSHL does not appear to have seasonal variations, uneven distributions of presentation throughout the year, or an association with upper respiratory infections, either prior to or following symptom onset [14]. The spontaneous recovery is currently thought to be 30–60% [15-17].",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on two main topics: the neuropsychological manifestations of mild hypoxia and the long-term consequences after an episode of severe hypoxia or of anoxia. In addition, it briefly discusses the mental status changes that may occur at high altitudes. With mild hypoxia, lowered levels of blood oxygen may produce symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, clumsiness, and poor judgment. Patients may behave as if they are intoxicated. When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death. Patients with chronic lung disorders are especially sensitive to inadequate ventilation during anesthesia. Individuals with sleep apnea are at risk for hypoxia during the night.",

      "title": "0817 Conquering Two Sleep Birds with One Iron stone: The Case of Resolved Restless Sleep Disorder and Parasomnia with Iron Therapy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) is characterized by frequent nocturnal movements of large muscle groups or a complaint of restless sleep by observers with associated daytime dysfunction.1 RSD, like other movement disorders of sleep, is associated with low iron stores.2 Children with RSD have increased NREM sleep instability and a propensity for parasomnia.2 No reports to date have demonstrated the use of iron therapy for parasomnia in patients with RSD. Furthermore, studies are limited in very young children with this disorder as they currently fall outside proposed diagnostic criteria.1 Report of Cases: A 2 year-old male presented to the sleep clinic with parental complaints of nightly sleep initiation and maintenance difficulty, mild snoring, restless sleep, episodes of sleepwalking and night terrors multiple times per week. Symptoms worsened over 6 months and were associated with daytime irritability and behavioral problems. Sleep quality measures assessed progress between visits: the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS SD) and Sleep Related Impairment (PROMIS SRI). Serum ferritin was initially 20ug/L. Polysmnogram demonstrated no significant sleep related breathing disorder, a large muscle group movement index of 14, periodic limb movement index of 3. Initial treatment included oral iron therapy, scheduled awakenings, and hypnotic dose melatonin. The sleep psychologist addressed limit setting and negative sleep associations with improved insomnia symptoms but parasomnia and restless sleep continued. The parent noted reduction in both movements and parasomnia frequency after one month of iron therapy. After a 3 month period on treatment, the parent reported complete cessation of the parasomnia, drastic reduction in restlessness, and near resolution of insomnia. Sleep quality measure PROMIS SD improved by 11, demonstrating reduced sleep disturbance. PROMIS SRI did not change. Ferritin level increased to 47ug/L. Conclusion RSD in a very young child with NREM parasomnia responded to oral iron therapy improving overall sleep quality. This case demonstrates the relationship between relative iron deficiency, RSD and associated parasomnia. Support (If Any) 1. DelRosso LM, Ferri R, Allen RP, et al.

      "title": "Acute Respiratory Failure from Abused Substances",
      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

From the day of deprivation – in the self-rating from the 4th day – up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

Common evening and night time disorders also include restless legs syndrome and associated periodic limb movements of sleep. Screening questions often help to identify the sleep problem that you are dealing with (box 1). Thereafter, sleep problems are best characterised on the basis of a thorough history. A collateral history from the bed partner is often helpful to define any restless legs, sleepwalking or parasomnia, snoring, and breathing abnormalities. Discussing the patient’s ideas about sleep, any concerns they might have, and their expectations of normal sleep is often worth while. #### Box 1: Sleep history questions",

      "title": "Headache and Sleep Disorders: Review and Clinical Implications for Headache Management",
      "abstract": "Review of epidemiological and clinical studies suggests that sleep disorders are disproportionately observed in specific headache diagnoses (eg, migraine, tension-type, cluster) and other nonspecific headache patterns (ie, chronic daily headache, \"awakening\" or morning headache). Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are of varied types, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. Headache, particularly morning headache and chronic headache, may be consequent to, or aggravated by, a sleep disorder, and management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache. Sleep-disordered breathing is the best example of this relationship. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Depression and anxiety are comorbid with both headache and sleep disorders (especially insomnia) and consideration of the full headache-sleep-affective symptom constellation may yield opportunities to maximize treatment. This paper reviews the comorbidity of headache and sleep disorders (including coexisting psychiatric symptoms where available). Clinical implications for headache evaluation are presented. Sleep screening strategies conducive to headache practice are described. Consideration of the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing is encouraged in the headache population, including awareness of potential upper airway resistance syndrome in headache patients lacking traditional risk factors for OSA. Pharmacologic and behavioral sleep regulation strategies are offered that are also compatible with treatment of primary headache.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

Moreover, in certain conditions, additional parameters may be included such as esophageal pH monitoring, esophageal manometry , and overnight blood pressure monitoring. The test is usually performed at a sleep disorders unit within a hospital or at a sleep disorders centre. Sleep architecture is largely divided into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM is further divided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3 : N3 being the deepest stage of sleep. REM sleep alternates with NREM sleep and a normal person usually has 4–6 cycles of REM and NREM sleep . Monitoring of the different sleep stages, sleep interruptions, movements, and the other respiratory and cardiac signals are clinically helpful for identifying the nature of patient’s sleep problems and assessing response to treatment.

      "abstract": "Nightmares can be defined as very disturbing dreams, the events or emotions of which cause the dreamer to wake up. In contrast, unpleasant dreams can be defined in terms of a negative emotional rating of a dream, irrespective of whether or not the emotions or events of the dream woke the dreamer. This study addresses whether frequency of unpleasant dreams is a better index of low well-being than is frequency of nightmares. A total of 147 participants reported their nightmare frequency retrospectively and then kept a log of all dreams, including nightmares, for 2 weeks, and rated each dream for pleasantness/unpleasantness. Anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and acute stress were found to be associated with nightmare distress (ND) (the trait-like general level of distress in waking-life caused by having nightmares) and prospective frequency of unpleasant dreams, and less so with the mean emotional tone of all dreams, or retrospective or prospective nightmare frequency. Correlations between low well-being and retrospective nightmare frequency became insignificant when trait ND was controlled for, but correlations with prospective unpleasant dream frequency were maintained. The reporting of nightmares may thus be confounded and modulated by trait ND: such confounding does not occur for the reporting of unpleasant dreams in general. Thus there may be attributional components to deciding that one has been awoken by a dream, which can affect estimated nightmare frequency and its relationship with well-being. Underestimation of nightmare frequency by the retrospective questionnaire compared with logs was found to be a function of mean dream unpleasantness and ND.",

      "abstract": "Sleep specialists are frequently referred adults with epilepsy to evaluate their sleep/wake complaints, sometimes to determine whether their paroxysmal nocturnal behaviors are epileptic or not. Many patients with epilepsy have at least one parasomnia (some more than one), and the sleep specialists are often asked to differentiate and treat these. Sleep specialists review which primary sleep disorders are more common in adults with epilepsy and how to evaluate and best treat these. The authors summarize (1) how to evaluate and differentiate parasomnias using video-polysomnography; (2) the value of sleep deprivation and loud auditory stimuli to increase the likelihood of provoking a non-rapid eye movement arousal parasomnia with a single night of video-polysomnography; and (3) how to score excessive muscle activity during rapid eye movement sleep to confirm a diagnosis of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The clinical semiology and video-polysomnography features of simple and complex sleep-related movement disorders and parasomnias are reviewed.",

This pattern differed between those with and without clinical diagnosis of PTSD/MDD. For those with PTSD/MDD, PTSD and depression symptoms but not sleep contributed to post-concussive symptoms. For those without PTSD/MDD, PTSD symptoms and sleep contributed specifically to somatosensory post-concussive symptoms. Daytime dysfunction and sleep disturbances were associated with post-concussive symptoms after PTSD and depression symptoms were controlled.PTSD symptom severity explained the most variance for post-concussive symptoms among service members with a history of mild TBI, while depression symptoms, daytime dysfunction, and sleep disturbances independently contributed small amounts of variance.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

Sleep is, in many ways, a time of vulnerability in respiratory illness. Changes in upper airway resistance and, at times, lower airway resistance, may exacerbate underlying pulmonary conditions. Sleep is also a time when hypoxemia may worsen, and this may impose its own associated health hazards. Since COPD and asthma are very common conditions, the burden of sleep-related physiological stress leads to a significant burden in terms of the number of people affected. Sleep in patients with less common lung diseases, such as restrictive disorders and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, show different patterns of physiological abnormalities during sleep.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but even so, it may still be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in current practice due to its non-specific manifestations. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in PD patients compared to healthy controls and to identify the main characteristics and associations of fatigue with other non-motor symptoms and the impact of fatigue on sleep disturbances in Parkinson’s disease. Materials and methods: case–control study in which 131 PD patients and 131 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Main characteristics of fatigue, sleep, and other non-motor symptoms were assessed using specific validated questionnaires. Results: According to the Chalder fatigue scale, fatigue is more prevalent in PD patients (38.16%) compared to healthy controls (26.71%). Fatigue was identified in 46.54% of the PD patients using the Parkinson’s Fatigue Scale (PFS-16). PD patients with fatigue presented a worse motor status, more sleep disturbances (insomnia, daytime sleepiness), a broader spectrum of non-motor symptoms (pain, anxiety, urinary disturbances), worse cognitive performances, a lower level of happiness, and worse quality of life compared to PD patients without fatigue. Conclusion: Fatigue is a common symptom of PD and needs to be assessed, considering its consequences on quality of life. Sleep disturbances have a great influence over fatigue in PD patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: major issues of differentiating epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysmal phenomena of sleep are presented in this article. Quality differentiation is possible in case of good knowledge of semiology of sleep-related epileptic seizure types and epileptic syndromes. Difficulties in identification can lead to further diagnostic mistakes. Parasomnias are the most frequently encountered non-epileptic paroxysmal events in sleep, which are related to both non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM-sleep parasomnias are otherwise referred to as arousal disorders. They could be mistaken for frontal lobe epilepsy seizures, which predominantly occur at night and are not readily accompanied by epileptiformabnormalities on EEG. Other sleep phenomena also should be considered in differentiating nocturnal epilepsies. Obstructive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements in sleep and some sleep episodes sometimes are expressed with a pattern hardly distinguishable from epileptic seizures. Complex approach and appropriate diagnostic algorithm would further help clinicians in this field to better assess any given situation.",

      "abstract": "ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Schlafstörungen gehen Demenzen häufig voran und können deren Verlauf verschlimmern. Die Interaktion ist bidirektional. Beide Erkrankungen haben gemeinsame Symptome wie kognitive Einschränkungen und Veränderungen von Schlafstruktur und Qualität. Wenn sich die Demenz einmal manifestiert hat, können Schlafstörungen wie obstruktive Schlafapnoe, Restless-legs-Syndrom und Parasomnien die Symptomatik verstärken. Die Schlafstruktur zeigt eine Verminderung von langsamwelligem Schlaf und häufiges nächtliches Erwachen mit längeren Wachzeiten. Schlaf ermöglicht es, mittels Aktivierung des glymphatischen Systems Aß- und Tau-Proteine, die sich im Wachen angesammelt haben, aus dem ZNS auszuschleusen. Wegen der bidirektionalen Interaktionen ist es erforderlich, Schlafstörungen vermehrte Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken und sie früh zu diagnostizieren und zu behandeln, um einer Verschlimmerung einer existierenden oder sich entwickelnden Demenz vorzubeugen. Eine Anzahl von subjektiven Fragebögen und objektiven Instrumenten wie Polysomnografie und Aktigrafie stehen für die Diagnostik zur Verfügung. Begleitende Schlafstörungen sollten immer mit behandelt werden (z. B. nasale Überdrucktherapie bei Schlafapnoe). Prävention oder Behandlung sollten immer Verhaltenstherapien wie körperliche Aktivierung, soziale Interaktion und ausreichende Exposition gegenüber Tageslicht beinhalten. Einige Antidepressiva, Melatonin, neue duale Orexinrezeptorantagonisten (in Deutschland nicht zugelassen) und wenige Hypnotika können zur Behandlung empfohlen werden. Die Schlafprobleme der betreuenden Personen sollten in den Behandlungsablauf eingeschlossen werden, um die Lebensqualität der Erkrankten zu optimieren.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most sleep‐related seizures occur during non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly during stage changes. Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a rare epileptic syndrome characterized by paroxysmal motor seizures, mainly arising from NREM sleep. Here, we report a patient with SHE who had seven seizures captured on video‐EEG‐polysomnography during REM sleep. Ictal semiology of this patient ranged from brief paroxysmal arousals to hypermotor seizures. On EEG‐polysomnography, the spontaneous arousals were more frequent during REM than NREM sleep, with a considerably higher arousal index in REM sleep (20/hour). While the reason for seizures during REM sleep in this patient is unclear, we speculate that the threshold and mechanisms of arousal during different sleep stages may be related to the occurrence of seizures.

The wide range of sleep disorders (e.g. delayed sleep onset or problems of sleep maintenance) and the added complication that the patient may be involved subsequently in skilled work demand that the pharmacokinetics of various hypnotics must be understood before the correct hypnotic can be chosen. Impaired performance is more severe and persists far longer with compounds that are slowly eliminated and with the use of higher doses. The particular situations of aircrew and mountaineers have been studied in detail. Caution must be exercised in the management of aircrew coping with irregularity of rest and work. Temazepam has been used for aircrew for over 10 years and the absence of adverse effects ensures that it remains the recommended hypnotic in this area of medical practice. The relationship of insomnia with the hypoxic environment is undetermined. To investigate this, sleep was studied in six individuals during an expedition to the Himalayas. At altitude, temazepam led to less wakefulness and to drowsy sleep ‐ there were no prolonged sleep latencies.",

      "abstract": "Резюме. Диагностика пароксизмальных состояний в неврологии — одна из самых сложных проблем. Особые трудности вызывает дифференциальная диагностика эпилептических и неэпилептических пароксизмальных нарушений ввиду отсутствия абсолютно достоверных клинических маркеров заболевания в межпароксизмальный период, не всегда достаточной информативности инструментальных методов исследования и недостаточной осведомленности врачей. Неэпилептические пароксизмальные нарушения ошибочно диагностируют как эпилепсию в 20–30% случаев даже в медицинских центрах третьего уровня. Ложная положительная диагностика эпилепсии имеет место в 2–71% случаев. Двигательные нарушения, характеризующиеся внезапными преходящими эпизодами патологической непроизвольной двигательной активности, такие как хорея, атетоз, неэпилептические миоклонии, дистония, пароксизмальная дискинезия, нарушение координации произвольных двигательных актов или сочетанные нарушения координации и непроизвольной двигательной активности (пароксизмальная атаксия), представляют значительные диагностические трудности даже для высококвалифицированных специалистов. Нет абсолютно патогномоничных признаков эпилептических и неэпилептических припадков. В статье приведены основные клинические и нейрофизиологические критерии дифференциальной диагностики эпилепсии и ряда двигательных нарушений. Лечебная тактика больных с эпилептическими приступами, которые должны быть дифференцированными с пароксизмальными двигательными нарушениями, имеет ряд особенностей. После установления диагноза «эпилепсия» назначают противоэпилептические препараты широкого спектра действия, не оказывающие негативного влияния на когнитивные функции и не требующие длительного титрования дозы. В таких случаях препаратом выбора может быть леветирацетам, который эффективен при большинстве эпилептических припадков, может эффективно применяться во взрослой и детской практике, не вызывает аггравации припадков, имеет минимальные побочные действия, может быть назначен сразу в терапевтической дозе, кроме того, эффективен при ряде двигательных нарушений и при сочетании эпилепсии с двигательными нарушениями.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

It was found that Stage I sleep and the phase of rapid sleep (PRS) were prolonged while delta-sleep was considerably shortened. This was accompanied by an increase in the latent periods of all stages of slow sleep and the shortening of the latent period of PRS. The patients displayed a tendency toward an increased number of sleep spindles and a considerable decrease in the delta-index. Patients with Huntington's chorea showed an increase in body movements during sleep. Dissociations were detected in polygraphic characteristics of individual phases of sleep.

      "title": "Annotation: Hyperlexia: disability or superability?",
      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

These seemed liable to occur in temporal lobe epilepsy. 2) Three of four patients in the hallucination and illusion group showed frequent epileptic discharges. However, no distinct relation existed between seizure discharges and psychotic episodes. 3) Eight of 11 patients in the dysphoria and excitement group were secondary generalized epilepsy. 4) In the dysphoria and excitement group, psychotic episodes occurred either as a result of the increase in epileptic discharges or conversely as a result of the suppression of epileptic discharges. The former was more frequent. Epileptic discharges tended to be suppressed in the Lennox syndrome and allied conditions relating to psychotic episodes. 5) A forced normalization-like phenomenon mostly resulted from the marked suppression of diffuse slow spike-waves. However, a complete suppression of epileptic discharges was not always noted.",

Complaints about sleep pattern changes may occur during any phase of the disease. These include frequent night-time awakenings, poor sleep quality, reduction of the total sleeping time (TST) and decreased latency and increased density of REM sleep. In the depressive phase, patients also reveal insomnia/hypersomnia, difficulty waking up and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep pattern fluctuations are frequent in bipolar disorders and have a great clinic implication as a symptom. The corrections of sleep disturbances observed in bipolar disorder should be considered a therapeutic priority, since they prevent symptoms recurrence and smooth the socio-professional integration, thus providing greater success in patient's rehabilitation and quality of life.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Laughter is a common emotion and may rarely be a manifestation of neurological illnesses. It has been associated with cataplexy as well. Cataplexy is usually triggered by strong emotions. Gelastic syncope is an uncommon phenomenon which may be mistaken for cataplexy. We summarize 3 cases referred to the Sleep Medicine clinic for evaluation for Narcolepsy. Report of Case 55 yo male comes with 2 episodes of blacking out and falling down relating to episodes of laughter in 3 months. Patient describes loss of consciousness and no episodes of freezing. Reported 15 years of snoring and witnessed apneas along with grinding his teeth while sleeping. Polysomnogram revealed Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with an AHI of 20. 60 yo male comes with episodes of loss of consciousness over the past 6 months, including sitting in a chair, laughing, urinating, washing dishes while standing, expressing strong emotions (father’s funeral), etc. Also reports bugs crawling over his legs when trying to sleep, loud snoring and waking up choking while sleeping. Polysomnogram revealed OSA with an AHI of 20. 43 yo male comes 3 episodes of loss of consciousness, 2 of them related to laughing and the last one related to stretching his arms out. He passes out for 5-10 seconds at a time and a period of 20-30 seconds before passing out where he feels dizzy when he is unable to respond at this time, no post episode confusion. Positive on the Cataplexy Emotional Trigger Questionairre. Reported witnessed apneas, snoring and sleep talking. Polysomnogram revealed OSA, hence the Multiple Sleep Latency Testing ordered was not completed. Conclusion While the first two episodes point towards Gelastic Syncope based on symptoms, the third did warrant MSLT if there was no OSA on PSG. It is important to recognize gelastic syncope as an entity and differentiate it from cataplexy.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder in which there is repeated collapse of the upper airway when the person is in sleep, which causes oxygen desaturation and interrupted sleep. While asleep, airway blockages and collapse are accompanied by awakenings with or without oxygen desaturation. OSA is a prevalent disorder, especially in people with known risk factors and other illnesses. Pathogenesis is variable, and the risk factors include low chest volume, erratic respiratory regulation, and muscular dysfunction in the upper airway dilators. The high-risk factors include overweight, male sex, aging, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, interruption of the menstrual cycle, preservation of liquids, and smoking. The signs are snoring, drowsiness, and apneas. A sleep history, assessment of symptoms, and physical examination are all part of the screening process for OSA, and the data can help determine which people need to be tested for the condition. The results of the polysomnogram or at-home sleep apnea test assist in determining the presence and severity of OSA. Still, it is seen many times that the accuracy of home sleep apnea tests is significantly less, so one should take an expert opinion for the same. OSA results in systemic hypertension, drowsiness, and driving accidents. It is additionally related to diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction, but the exact mechanism is not known. The preferred treatment is continuous positive airway pressure with 60-70% adherence. Other management options include reducing weight, therapy of oral appliances, and correcting any anatomical obstruction (narrow pharyngeal airway, adenoid hypertrophy, and mass in the pharynx). OSA indirectly causes headaches just after awakening and daytime sleepiness. However, there are no age boundaries in OSA as it can occur in any age group. Still, more prevalence is seen in individuals of more than 60 years of age.",

      "title": "Impact of nocturia on sleep and quality of life: A brief, selected review for the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI‐RS) nocturia think tank",
      "abstract": "Nocturia, the need to awaken at night to void, is a highly prevalent disorder that negatively affects nocturnal sleep, increases daytime tiredness, and adversely impacts quality of life. In this selective review, we provide the reader an overview of current work in this area. From the perspective of disturbed sleep, two divergent perspectives have emerged from the literature when discussing nocturia. The first is that a patient awakens because of an urge to urinate. The second is that a patient awakens during the night for some reason unrelated to urinary urge (e.g., an awakening from an environmental source or from intrinsic lightening of sleep) and then decides to void while awake. In the few studies that have inquired about nocturia as a cause of awakenings, nocturia often ranks above the traditional psychological or physical factors. Not only is nocturia likely to disrupt sleep, but it may impact waking quality of life as well. A number of generic and nocturia‐related questionnaires have been used to quantify the effect of nocturia on quality of life. In this short paper, we introduce the reader to several key studies in these important areas. Neurourol. Urodynam. 33:S15–S18, 2014 . © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

According to recent figures published by the WHO, sleep disturbance is one of the most deleterious non-auditory effects of environmental noise. A connection between noise exposure in the residential setting and detrimental effects on sleep and health is suggested by observational, experimental and epidemiological evidence that has been accumulated over the last decades. Maximum sound pressure levels as low as 33 dB have been shown to induce physiological reactions such as autonomic, motor, and cortical arousals (e.g., tachycardia, body movements, awakenings). Whether or not noise will induce such acute effects depends on the number of noise events and their acoustical properties, but also on situational moderators (e.g. momentary sleep stage) and individual noise sensitivity. Although clinical sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) have been shown to be associated with increased risks for cardiovascular diseases, only little is known about long-term effects of noise-disturbed sleep on cardiovascular health. In the past years, several hints have surfaced that undermine the suspicion that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of long term effects than daytime noise exposure. The paper reviews the present state of research in the domain of noise-induced sleep disturbances from transportation and other noise sources, compares exposure-effect functions, critically appraises methods for the assessment of noise effects on sleep, and reviews potential mechanisms of the genesis of long term health effects due to noise-induced sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "Parasomnias",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical and/or experiential phenomena accompanying sleep that involve skeletal muscle activity (movements, behaviours), autonomic nervous system changes, and/or emotional-perceptual events. Parasomnias can emerge during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of sleep; therefore, all of sleep carries a vulnerability for parasomnias. Parasomnias can be objectively diagnosed by means of polysomnography (i.e. the physiologic monitoring of sleep—figures 4.14.4.1, 4.14.4.2), and can be successfully treated in the majority of cases. Understanding of the parasomnias, based on polysomnographic documentation, has expanded greatly over the past two decades, as new disorders have been identified, and as known disorders have been recognized to occur more frequently, across a broader age group, and with more serious consequences than previously understood. Parasomnias demonstrate how our instinctual behaviours, such as locomotion, feeding, sex, and aggression, can be released during sleep, itself a basic instinct. There are at least eight reasons why parasomnias should be of interest and importance to psychiatrists: 1 Parasomnias can be misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as a psychiatric disorder. 2 Parasomnias can be a direct manifestation of a psychiatric disorder, e.g. dissociative disorder, nocturnal bulimia nervosa. 3 The emergence and/or recurrence of a parasomnia can be triggered by stress. 4 Psychotropic medications can induce the initial emergence of a parasomnia, or aggravate a preexisting parasomnia. 5 Parasomnias can cause psychological distress or can induce or reactivate a psychiatric disorder in the patient or bed partner on account of repeated loss of self-control during sleep and sleep-related injuries. 6 Familiarity with the parasomnias will allow psychiatrists to be more fully aware of the various medical and neuro-logical disorders, and their therapies, that can be associated with disturbed (sleep-related) behaviour and disturbed dreaming. 7 Parasomnias present a special opportunity for interlinking animal basic science research (including parasomnia animal models) with human (sleep) behavioural disorders. 8 Parasomnias carry forensic implications, as exemplified by the newly-recognized entity of ‘Parasomnia Pseudo-suicide.’ Also, psychiatrists are often asked to render an expert opinion in medicolegal cases pertaining to sleep-related violence.",

      "title": "Dynamics of recovery sleep from chronic sleep restriction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep loss is common in our 24/7 society with many people routinely sleeping less than they need. Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, “banking” sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

      "abstract": "Diurnal blood pressure (BP) fluctuations are superimposed by a 24-h rhythm with usually lower levels during the night and higher levels during the day. In contrast to other rhythmic bioparameters, the diurnal BP rhythm is largely dependent on activity and sleep rather than on clock time. This has been demonstrated by the BP characteristics after shifted sleeping and working phases, during transition from sleep to wakefulness, and by the influence of sleep and activities on the 24-h BP curve during normal daily routines. Whereas the circadian rhythm of BP is predominantly governed by external time triggers, endogenous rhythmicity can only be detected by time microscopic analysis or in conditions where effects of external time triggers are almost excluded.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia complaints increase with age and are frequently made by elderly people. Recently non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed more often, among which stimulus control. One of the stimulus control instructions is the advice not to nap in the daytime, based on the assumption that napping affects sleep quality the following night, due to a decrease of sleep need. This article discusses the function of napping and the impact of napping on sleep. The decline of sleep duration during aging is not due to a disturbance of the endogenous circadian rhythm but rather to a decrease of the physiological sleep need. Naps do not have the function to compensate for the decreased sleep duration but to meet an increased psychological sleep need. During daytime elderly people are physiologically less sleepy than young adults, who, nevertheless, sleep on average longer. Napping does not negatively affect sleep. Consequently, the assumption on which the advice against napping is based is wrong.",

      "title": "A Review of Scales to Evaluate Sleep Disturbances in Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Patients with movement disorders have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances that can be classified as 1) nocturnal sleep symptoms, such as insomnia, nocturia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements (PLM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and REM sleep behaviour disorder; and 2) diurnal problems that include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks. The objective of this review is to provide a practical overview of the most relevant scales that assess these disturbances in order to guide the choice of the most useful instrument/s depending on the line of research or clinical focus. For each scale, the reader will find a brief description of practicalities and psychometric properties, use in movement disorder cohorts and analysed strengths and limitations. To assess insomnia, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a generic scale, and three disease-specific scales: the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), the PDSS-2, and Scales for outcomes in PD-Sleep-Nocturnal Sleep subscale are discussed. To evaluate nocturia there are no specific tools, but some extensively validated generic urinary symptom scales (the Overall Bladder Questionnaire and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score) and some PD specific scales that include a nocturia item are available. To measure RLS severity, there are currently four domain specific generic scales: The International Restless Legs Scale, the Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Severity Scale, the RLS-6 measure, a Paediatric RLS Severity Scale, the Augmentation Severity Rating Scale (a scale to evaluate augmentation under treatment) and several instruments that assess impact on quality of sleep and health related quality of life. To evaluate the presence of PLM, no clinical scales have been developed to date. As far as OSA, commonly used instruments such as the Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, the STOP-Bang questionnaire and the Berlin Questionnaire are reviewed. Three scales have been extensively used to assess EDS: the generic Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the PD specific Scales for outcomes in PD-Sleep-Daytime sleepiness subscale. To date, only the Inappropriate Sleep Composite Score (ISCS) specifically evaluates propensity to sleep attacks.",

      "abstract": "Snoring is the audible consequence of the pharyngeal airway collapsing when one inspires. Snoring can disrupt sleep, cause a variety of important but nonspecific symptoms, and suggest the presence of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which can lead to cor pulmonale and sudden death. Therefore, the review of systems for a child at any age should include questions regarding snoring and breathing during sleep. Most normal children snore at one time or another, and many, particularly those who have nasal allergies, snore almost nightly. Pediatricians should be able to identify which snoring children do not require treatment or referral, which are candidates for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, and which should be referred for polysomnography (sleep study) or more specialized evaluation. Physiologic Sources of the Problem Snoring and obstructive sleep apnea do not represent structural upper airway narrowing alone, but rather an imbalance between the degree of airway narrowing and the ability of the respiratory centers in the brainstem to use the muscles of the pharynx and tongue to maintain airway patency. For each child who has tonsillar hypertrophy and who snores, there are many who have larger tonsils who do not snore because they use their pharyngeal muscles to keep the airway open during sleep.",

The authors submit two case-histories of middle aged women (30 and 37 years old) without disturbances of the day-time eating behaviour, without obvious psychopathology where the symptomatology of NES developed slowly from the age of 14 and 25 years resp. Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating.

      "title": "Ask About Daytime Sleepiness!",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is being recognized increasingly as a significant public health problem.1 Sleep loss or inadequate sleep time is the most common cause of EDS in the general population.1–3 Primary sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and periodic leg movements in sleep are prevalent, particularly among older persons, and can contribute to EDS.4 Other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, psychiatric illness, chronic pain syndromes, and several neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders, can disrupt sleep and lead to EDS. Moreover, widely prescribed medications, including diuretics, antihypertensives, sympathomimetic agents, corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, and certain antidepressants, can cause EDS by interfering with sleep continuity and/or by having a direct sedating effect in the daytime. The adverse consequences of EDS are numerous. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hypersomnolence is associated with neurocognitive deficits, including decrements in attention, vigilance, and memory.5 Evidence also supports a strong association between EDS and an increased risk for domestic, work-related, and motor vehicle accidents.6,7 Impaired general health status and limitations in activities of daily living are yet other common sequela.8,9 Furthermore, landmark epidemiologic studies such as the Honolulu Heart Program and the Cardiovascular Health Study have associated EDS with a higher prevalence of heart disease, congestive heart failure, and dementia.10,11 The important report by Newman et al. in this issue extends our understanding by documenting an independent association between EDS and incident cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. In addition, the gender differences noted in the current investigation are consistent with previous reports of the high prevalence of sleep complaints among women and with the association of sleep disordered breathing with increased mortality in women in the nursing home setting.12 The causal pathway between EDS and morbid events, including cognitive dysfunction, accidents, and impaired quality of life, is readily envisioned. The occurrence of brief “microsleeps” and even prolonged sleep episodes in the daytime can decrease vigilance and lead to compromised performance at home, work, or during safety-sensitive tasks such as driving. Moreover, the inability to maintain wakefulness during the day can have a deleterious influence on social functioning and can lower one's sense of well-being. See also p 115 Yet unresolved, however, are the mechanisms through which EDS relates independently to cardiovascular end-points and mortality. At least three different causal pathways are proposed. First, it is possible that the increased morbidity and mortality associated with EDS are a function of underlying sleep disorders that cause EDS. It is well established that sleep-disordered breathing is prevalent in the general population. In middle-aged adults the prevalence is estimated to be at least 2 to 4%, and in certain subgroups it may be much higher.13 Several investigators have shown that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing increases with age, with estimates that perhaps 30 to 40% of older individuals may have this chronic disorder.12,14,15 Recent work indicates that the frequency of disordered breathing events, severity of associated oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and degree of sleep fragmentation contribute independently to the occurrence of EDS.16 Clinic- and population-based studies have also shown an association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension and prevalent cardiovascular disease independent of the effects of age, gender, smoking, and obesity.17 Therefore, in this setting, morbidity and mortality caused by EDS reflect underlying primary sleep disorders that are, in turn, associated with cardiovascular end-points and mortality. Second, many of the chronic medical conditions that are prevalent in older people, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, emphysema, and depression, can be related indirectly to EDS through their interference with nocturnal sleep quality. It is now appreciated that congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can predispose to sleep-disordered breathing, which can potentially exacerbate the predisposing condition.18,19 As with the occurrence of a primary sleep disorder, EDS in this setting is merely a surrogate marker for these chronic ailments, Third, it is possible that EDS has a direct role, through an undefined mechanism, in increasing morbidity and mortality, independent of either underlying primary sleep disorders or other recognized chronic medical illnesses. Experimental sleep deprivation studies in normal volunteers demonstrate a heightened sympathetic drive with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines.20,21 Extensive data indicate that sleep deprivation is also linked with significant alterations in the neuroendocrine axis characterized by an increase in serum Cortisol levels and a slower rate of daylong decline following the early morning circadian elevation.21,22 In the context of multiple chronic illnesses that are common among older adults, such neurohumoral alterations can increase further the probability of precipitating adverse events and require further delineation. Daytime sleepiness is assessed either objectively or subjectively. Objective methods include the multiple sleep latency test and the maintenance of wakefulness test.21–24 The former is used commonly in the clinical setting and many consider it to be the gold standard for the assessment of sleepiness. Subjective methods utilize self-report to identify sleep propensity and include validated questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.24,25 Since patients often underestimate their own degree of sleepiness, validated questionnaires addressing the likelihood of feeling drowsy or falling asleep during specific activities are more effective than general inquiries regarding the presence or absence of EDS. Moreover, questions about specific sleep-wake habits and input from family members, bed partners, and/or caregivers can provide a more accurate estimate of the degree and functional impact of EDS. In their study, Newman et al. use a general inquiry for identifying sleep-related problems and daytime sleepiness, raising the possibility of some degree of misclassification in their exposure variable (i.e., daytime sleepiness). In another recent prospective population-based study, the presence of self-reported snoring and general EDS was associated with total death rate and cardiovascular mortality. This effect was age-dependent and persisted after adjustment for body mass index, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Interestingly, isolated snoring or hypersomnolence were not associated with increased mortality.26 In each of these investigations, the use of validated questionnaires to assess EDS and information regarding the presence of documented sleep-related disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) would have been invaluable in examining the true independent effect of EDS on cardiovascular endpoints and all-cause mortality and the pathogenesis of this relationship. Newer initiatives sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have addressed some of the limitations of these important initial studies. The Sleep Heart Health Study, a multi-site longitudinal cohort study, is investigating the links between sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular endpoints.27 Until such prospective data clarify these relationships, we believe that currently available evidence supports the simple, noninvasive measure of asking our patients about their sleep and, in particular, about the presence of inappropriate hypersomnolence. All healthcare professionals have an important role in recognizing EDS as a sign and symptom that is amenable to effective treatment, The time-honored notion that somnolence is an expected (and accepted) concomitant of normal aging requires reevaluation: EDS that intrudes on daytime function not only compromises the quality of life but may also threaten lifespan. Despite the high prevalence of primary and secondary sleep problems among older persons, health professionals have often not prioritized the sleep history essential to recognition of potentially treatable conditions, and an important opportunity for health promotion is lost.28 We can and must do better.",

There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to median age at onset of epilepsy or complex partial seizures, age, or duration of epilepsy at time of examination. The psychotic patients had a significant preponderance of temporal medio-basal spike foci, recorded on the sphenoidal electrode, indicating deep temporal lobe dysfunction as an important factor in the pathogenesis of psychosis. A significant higher frequency of bilateral and multiple spike foci, together with a significant frequency of slow-wave admixture to the waking background EEG activity, indicated more extensive and severe epileptogenic lesions in the psychotic patients. There was no correlation between psychosis and unilateral EEG-foci in either temporal lobe.",

He noted difficulty in writing when he was 57 years old because he could not remember Japanese characters well, and this was accompanied by severe insomnia. He frequently had VH both during the day and at night. Two typical hallucinations are described below.\n\n(1) The patient was at home when suddenly six people broke into his living room and started cooking silently. He asked them why they had come and what they were doing, but no one answered. He questioned them repeatedly and tried to tap one on the shoulder, but as soon as his hand touched the ghost’s shoulder, they all vanished instantaneously.\n\n(2) One night, when the patient went to the toilet, he found his wife lying …",

      "abstract": "Le trouble bipolaire (TB) est une maladie psychiatrique multifactorielle à hérédité complexe faisant intervenir des facteurs de risque génétiques et environnementaux [1]. Parmi ces facteurs de risque, des anomalies des rythmes circadiens et du sommeil ont été mises en évidence dans les TB et témoignent de l’implication d’anomalies de l’horloge circadienne dans la physiopathologie du TB [2]. En effet, Il existe une littérature importante sur les anomalies circadiennes observées dans le TB (sommeil, rythmes veille/sommeil, chronotypes, perturbations circadiennes biologiques et comportementales, etc.). Ces anomalies sont présentes, non seulement en phase aiguë, mais aussi au cours des phases de stabilité de l’humeur (ou euthymiques) constituant ainsi des anomalies « trait » du TB [2]. Ainsi, l’exploration du sommeil et des rythmes circadiens chez des patients euthymiques avec TB par des mesures objectives (actigraphie) et subjectives (questionnaires) démontre que les patients présentent un sommeil plus long, de moins bonne qualité, avec retard important à l’endormissement, plus de réveils nocturnes et un retentissement diurne plus important que des témoins sains [3]. Par ailleurs, certains variants de gènes circadiens associés au TB peuvent s’associer chez les patients à des modifications particulières de ces rythmes circadiens. Ainsi, dans une étude pilote, il a été observé qu’un variant commun associé au TB du gène ASMT (codant pour l’une des deux enzymes de synthèse de la mélatonine) était associé à une modification des rythmes circadiens marquée par une période de sommeil allongée, une plus grande activité nocturne et une plus grande stabilité des rythmes [4]. Ces résultats intéressants soulignent l’intérêt de l’exploration des anomalies circadiennes du TB dans un but étiopathogénique et diagnostique, mais aussi possiblement thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Snoring usually is trivial and unimportant, but it can turn into a social or medical problem. Obesity, hypertension and heart disease are more frequent among snorers than among nonsnorers, and especially snorers with hypersomnia during the day are at risk. Hypersomnia in association with snoring usually signifies obstructive sleep apnea. Increased resistance in the upper airways, together with negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure and muscular hypotonia during deep non-REM and REM sleep, lead to collapse of the pharynx, hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only after arousal from sleep does muscle tone return, pharyngeal obstruction reopen and airflow resume. Since this process can occur 300 or 400 times a night, repetitive alveolar hypoventilation leads to pulmonary-arterial hypertension and cor pulmonale, and the repetitive sympathetic activations can cause systemic hypertension or serious cardiac arrhythmias. The countless arousals deprive the sufferer of deep non-REM and REM sleep and their consequence is sleep fragmentation. The symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and personality and behavioral changes. Oronasomaxillofacial, endocrine and neuromuscular anomalies and diseases predispose to sleep apnea, and alcohol or CNS-depressant drugs can favour its occurrence. Diagnosis is made by nighttime oxymetry, and if this is abnormal, by polysomnography. After polysomnography it is possible to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive sleep apnea, and the decisions for an adequate treatment can be made.",

It is recognized as feelings of being worn-out, tired, lethargic, and irritable, with fuzzy thinking and difficulty in getting going. When it occurs, it tends to last for an average of 4.4 hr. This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great. These data suggest the testable hypothesis that optimal durations of sleep fall into a relatively narrow band and that disruptive psycho-physiological effects are sustained with both too much and too little sleep.",

      "abstract": "Thirty-five EEG patterns of grand mal seizures recorded under some conditions such as awake-rest, sleep activation, beme-gride activation and intermittent photic stimulation were studied in 31 epileptics and four non-epileptics. Preictal EEG's were generally variable in comparison with ictal EEG's. It was not till 10 sec before seizures that the incidence of seizure discharges changed in most all cases, of which six increased and four decreased. A paroxysmal extreme varied EEG abnormality often continued for several to several ten sec immediately before a tonic phase, associated with some clinical symptoms. EEG patterns of the “preconvulsive phase” were divided into six types with different clinical features. In most all cases of bamegride activation, poly-spike and wave discharges preceded on seizure activities and some of them related with absence or psychomotor epilepsies. In all cases of sleep activation and photic stimulation, high voltage slow bursts or poly spikes preceded. Seizure patterns recorded at awake-rest were indefinite. A few cases didn't show any preconvulsive EEG changes, and were closely related with grand mal epilepsies. While the grand mal seizure during sleep had a long tonic-clonic convulsive phase and a short pre- and postconvulsive phase, that induced by bemegride activation showed the opposite findings. The grand mal seizure at awake-rest had the middle tendency between the two. The differences among the effects of various recording conditions on seizure patterns present some suggestions as to the patho-physiological mechanism of epileptic seizures.",

The present study investigated whether subclinical levels of anxiety were associated with sleep disturbance and daytime functioning in older adults who met diagnostic criteria for primary insomnia, and therefore did not meet criteria for depression or an anxiety disorder. After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log). Elevated state and trait anxiety were associated with worse social functioning, and higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with worse role functioning. Thus, subclinical anxiety symptoms may be an important target for clinical intervention to improve sleep and functioning in older adults with primary insomnia.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders and dementia].",
      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

The results of polysomnography in these pathological states are presented, indicating a decrease in sleep efficiency, a change in its \"architecture\", and a longer waking time during the night with insomnia; a significant increase in the apnea/hypopnea index, a delay in the phase of fast sleep, a decrease in the duration of deep stages of sleep and a decrease in its effectiveness - in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

Patients with acute or chronic pain often complain of difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, shorter sleep duration, unrefreshing sleep, and poor sleep quality in general. According to the majority of the experimental human studies, sleep deprivation may produce hyperalgesic changes. The selective disruption of slow wave sleep has shown this effect more consistently, while results after selective REM sleep deprivation remain unclear. Patients with chronic pain have a marked alteration of sleep structure and continuity, such as frequent sleep-stage shifts, increased nocturnal awakenings, decreased slow wave sleep (SWS), decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and alpha-delta sleep. Many analgesic medications can alter sleep architecture in a manner similar to the effects of acute and chronic pain, suppressing SWS and REM sleep.",

The disease remains underdiagnosed in the general population but likely also in pregnancy, mostly because providers do not appropriately screen for the disorder. Sleep disordered breathing may manifest differently in women, since women report more fatigue and less snoring than men do. This paper discusses typical presentations of sleep disordered breathing but also reports some less obvious presentations to help providers recognise those manifestations and screen for the disorder when warranted. Our case series describes patients with diagnoses such as chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, nocturnal asthma and panic attacks, who were diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing and offered treatment with CPAP during pregnancy.",

The most common sleep disorders in schizophrenia are insomnia, restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm disorders. The relevance of insomnia should be emphasized, as it can be a prodromal signof schizophrenia, as well as an alarm sign of an incipient psychotic decompensation. Additionally, the clinical recovery of a psychotic process is usually correlated with sleep normalization. Multiple polysomnographic disturbances on sleep architecture have been found in patients with schizophrenia, including increased sleep latency, awakenings during sleep, sleep-wake cycle inversion, as well as poor sleep efficiency. These objective disturbances have been correlated to subjective poor sleep quality and other main clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

A differential sensitivity of various cognitive processes to sleep inertia may be a significant contributing factor to these complaints such as working memory. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=37; Age=36.42 ± 14.14; 81.09% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=17), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=7), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=3) and Type 2 (n=2), KLS(n=1) and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=7) were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4 and 0-back and 3-back N-Back tasks before and after nap 3. Accuracy on the N-Back was defined as correct classification rate of targets and non-targets. PVT and N-back performance was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. For Nap 4, lapses, RRT, and S-RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.47 ± 19.29(pre) vs 15.01 ± 21.15(post),t=2.02,p=0.05); (3.36±.85(pre) vs 2.93 ± 1.01(post),t=-3.97,p=0.0003); (2.03±.79(pre) vs 1.73±.80(post),t=-3.27,t=0.0018), respectively. Nap 4 sleep time, sleep efficiency and accumulated sleep through 4 naps (except for lapses) was significantly associated with lapses, Mean RRT and Mean S-RRT. Accuracy on the 3-Back demonstrated significant improvement post-nap relative to pre-nap, (.61±.25(pre)vs.71±.21(post),t=3.92,p=.0004), and associated with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.13,SE=.05,p=.011). Similar results for 0-Back accuracy (.78±.27(pre)vs.88±.18(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), and association with Nap 3 sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Reaction Times(ms) for 3 and 0-back demonstrated similar improvement, (1143.36 ± 452.52(pre)vs.1091.06 ± 470.83(post),t=-2.90,p=.006) and (840.11 ± 366.5(pre)vs 832.15 ± 383.3(post),t=3.93,p=.0004), respectively; with 0-back associated with sleep efficiency (B=-.14,SE=.04,p=.0008). Depreciation of psychomotor vigilance is consistent with previous findings, while improvements in working memory performance suggests discriminating the effects and sensitivities of sleep inertia from benefits of sleep-consolidation requires multiple WM tasks in addition to the N-back.

      "title": "Practical Consequences of Fatigue-Related Performance Failures",
      "abstract": "THE FACT THAT TIRED PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM AS WELL AS WELL-RESTED PEOPLE DO IS A TRUISM THAT HAS BEEN LONG CONFIRMED BY CAREFUL EMPIRIC study in the laboratory.1 What is less obvious is the way in which fatigue manifests itself in performance changes. At one extreme, the fatigued subject may be in a microsleep (or, indeed, full sleep), in which case there will be a missed or tardy response. Such effects are often best detected by measuring lapses (unduly slow responses), for example, in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. This was shown nicely in a study of repeated sleep restriction,2 in which the number of lapses increased as the week of restricted sleep progressed. However, even without microsleeps, there can be a general slowing in information-processing speed.3 Others4 have argued that sleep loss results in a loss of cognitive creativity, as indicated by a tendency to use old information processing strategies, even though they are no longer optimal or even practical. Certainly, from all viewpoints, the more extreme (and/or chronic) the sleep loss and the longer and more boring the task, the more likely performance decrements are to occur.5\r\n\r\nIn most real-world situations, the worst consequences of fatigue result not from a response slowing from 200 milliseconds to 750 milliseconds, for example, but from a major cognitive or attention failure—something many in the field refer to as a loss of situational awareness.6,7 This loss manifests itself in the operator no longer responding appropriately, or perhaps even responding completely inappropriately, to the situation. Thus, in hindsight, it is clear to the individual concerned that an error was made or that an important feature of the situation was missed. Sometimes this loss of situational awareness results in a catastrophe such as Three Mile Island or Exxon Valdez8; at other times, the situation is saved by additional levels of safety control, resulting in only a near miss. A recent (4/10/2007) public letter from Mark Rosenker, the chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), to Marion Blakely, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and to the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATC) union gives a useful insight into such real-world examples. The letter discusses one recent catastrophe and four recent near misses in the field of commercial aviation that may have resulted from a loss of situational awareness related to fatigue. It also gives the sleep community a compelling case for continuing their public campaign against chronic sleep loss and in furthering the study of the performance consequences of such loss. The full text of the letter is available on the NTSB public website at http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2007/A07_30_32.pdf.\r\n\r\nIn his letter, NTSB Chairman Rosenker expressed concern about accidents and near misses perhaps attributable to ATC personnel working while fatigued. He noted that the NTSB had long been concerned with the effects of fatigue in persons involved in critical functions and the dangers to safety that arose as a consequence. He also documented the large number of suggestions that the NTSB had made to the FAA over the years with the aim of improving the situation and noted that few of them appeared to have been acted upon. In the beginning of his letter, Chairman Rosenker discussed a recent (8/27/2006) fatal air crash at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe airplane had been cleared by air traffic control (ATC) for takeoff on runway 22, which is 7,003 feet long and equipped with high-intensity runway lights; however, the crew mistakenly taxied onto runway 26, which is 3,500 feet long and unlighted, and attempted to take off. The airplane ran off the end of runway 26, impacted the airport perimeter fence and trees, and crashed. Of the 47 passengers and 3 crew members on board the airplane, 49 were killed, and one received serious injuries… During its ongoing investigation of this accident, the Safety Board has learned that the air traffic controller who cleared the accident airplane for takeoff had worked a shift from 0630 to 1430 the day before the accident, then returned 9 hours later to work the accident shift from 2330 until the time of the accident at 0607 the next morning. The controller stated that his only sleep in the 24 hours before the accident was a 2-hour nap the previous afternoon between these 2 shifts.\r\n\r\nThe NTSB chairman also gave four examples of near misses from Chicago (3/23/2006), Los Angeles (8/19/2004), Denver (9/25/2001), and Seattle (7/8/2001), all potentially involving fatigued ATCs. In all four cases, a loss of situational awareness may have been to blame. In three cases, the ATC put two planes on a collision course on the same runway; in the fourth, the controller failed to notice that the pilot had selected the wrong runway (which was closed for repair). Here is the Los Angeles example.\r\n\r\nA controller cleared a Boeing 737 passenger airplane to taxi onto and take off from runway 24L at the same time that another passenger airplane, a Boeing 747, had been cleared to land on the same runway and was on a short final approach. The pilots in the landing airplane saw the 737 taxi onto the runway and discontinued their approach about 12 seconds before the impending collision would have occurred, passing approximately 200 feet above the 737 during the go-around. The investigation determined that when the controller began working the local control position, he received a correct position-relief briefing that the 747 was approaching runway 24L. The controller later indicated that he subsequently developed a mistaken belief that the 747 was landing on the adjacent parallel runway 24R. The investigation determined that the controller had worked a shift the previous evening from 1530 until 2330, then went home and slept between 5 and 6 hours before returning to work the incident shift, which began at 0730. The controller described the portion of his shift before the incident as a “hard day” and attributed his error, in part, to fatigue.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may concern shift work and overtime, both of which can have a potentially negative impact on the amount of sleep obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that all 5 incidents occurred immediately after a short return, i.e., a break of only 9 hours between the end of one shift and the start of another. Short returns have been cited as the major problem with regard to backward (phase advance) rotating shifts.9 Such issues can often be worsened by a shortage of qualified personnel to fill positions and an aging workforce. Many in the FAA undoubtedly care deeply about the ATC fatigue issue, and there has been some FAA research activity in this regard and have been a few attempts at employee education. However, as the NTSB letter notes, “The findings that controllers have minimal recollection of the FAA's previously disseminated fatigue-related information and poor awareness of fatigue-related issues and that they inconsistently apply personal strategies for maximizing restorative sleep suggest that safety could be improved by providing more intensive training to controllers on shift-work and fatigue-related issues.”\r\n\r\nThe examples given in the NTSB letter reinforce the need for the sleep community to continue to study the issue of insufficient sleep leading to a loss of situational awareness, even though such experiments may be difficult to design and execute. The NTSB letter also suggests a useful roadmap by which elected officials, the FAA, their employees, other government agencies and the traveling public can be better educated regarding the negative consequences of fatigue and the various ways in which such negative consequences can be ameliorated or avoided. The sleep community is ideally suited to take an active role in this endeavor by ensuring the development and implementation of scientifically accurate education and outreach tools.",

La valutazione clinica (anamnesi ed esame obiettivo) e la polisonnografia sono fondamentali per la diagnosi di OSAS. La registrazione polisonnografica può avere differenti gradi di complessità, che permettono la registrazione non solo dei parametri cardiorespiratori durante il sonno ma anche di altri bio-parametri utili nella diagnosi differenziale con altri disturbi del sonno. L’eccessiva sonnolenza diurna è il più comune sintomo diurno associato ad OSAS. La sua valutazione è di fondamentale importanza soprattutto nei pazienti con sospetta OSAS che ricoprano attività lavorative a rischio per sonnolenza (es. autisti professionisti). La valutazione della sonnolenza può essere effettuata attraverso la somministrazione di questionari in ambulatorio, o attraverso test polisonnografici o di performance in laboratorio. Questi ultimi hanno il vantaggio di fornire al medico una quantificazione oggettiva della sonnolenza, utile soprattutto in caso di accertamenti medico-legali, ma richiedono tempo e dotazioni strumentali per cui attualmente sono effettuabili solo presso pochi centri altamente specializzati. Sono in fase di studio test oggettivi di valutazione della sonnolenza di facile e rapida somministrazione.",

Snoring which is often loud and habitual accompanied with daytime sleepiness tiredness are common manifestations. OSA often exhibit mood swings. Studies suggest a close association of OSA depression and anxiety. The management of OSA chiefly rests on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure CPAP while sleeping. The results have been rewarding. Its regular usage not only corrects the sleep disorder but also shows benefits in the consequences. Reports suggest that depression in OSA gradually resolves with CPAP usage. The association of OSA depression and anxiety needs to be explored further.nbsp",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

The major cause of the hyperhidrosis is sympathetic overactivity and, in the case of narcolepsy type 1, orexin deficiency may also contribute. In this narrative review, we will provide an outline of the possible mechanisms underlying sudomotor dysfunction and the resulting nocturnal hyperhidrosis in these different sleep disorders and explore its clinical relevance.",

      "abstract": "Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder of breathing but is probably underappreciated as a perioperative risk factor.Methods: This review is based on pertinent articles, published up to 15 August 2015, that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed based on the terms \"sleep apnea AND anesthesia\" OR \"sleep apnea AND pathophysiology.\"The guidelines of multiple specialty societies were considered as well.Results: OSA is characterized by phases of upper airway obstruction accompanied by apnea/hypoventilation, with hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and recurrent overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system.It has been reported that 22% to 82% of all adults who are about to undergo surgery have OSA.The causes of OSA are multifactorial and include, among others, an anatomical predisposition and /or a reduced inspiratory activation of the bronchodilator muscles, particularly when the patient is sleeping or has taken a sedative drug, anesthetic agent, or muscle relaxant.OSA is associated with arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure.It can be assessed before the planned intervention with polysomnography and structured questionnaires (STOP/STOP-BANG), with sensitivities of 62% and 88%.The utility of miniaturized screening devices is debated.Patients with OSA are at risk for perioperative problems including difficult or ineffective mask ventilation and/or intubation, postoperative airway obstruction, and complications arising from other comorbid conditions.They should be appropriately monitored postoperatively depending on the type of intervention they have undergone, and depending on individually varying, patient-related factors; postoperative management in an intensive care unit may be indicated, although no validated data on this topic are yet available.Conclusion: OSA patients need care by specialists from multiple disciplines, including anesthesiologists with experience in recognizing OSA, securing the airway of OSA patients, and managing them postoperatively.No randomized trials have yet compared the modalities of general anesthesia for OSA patients with respect to postoperative complications or phases of apnea or hypopnea.►Cite this as:",

      "title": "Utilizing Multi-Class Classification Methods for Automated Sleep Disorder Prediction",
      "abstract": "Even from infancy, a human’s day-life alternates from a period of wakefulness to a period of sleep at night, during the 24-hour cycle. Sleep is a normal process necessary for human physical and mental health. A lack of sleep makes it difficult to control emotions and behaviour, reduces productivity at work, and can even increase stress or depression. In addition, poor sleep affects health; when sleep is insufficient, the chances of developing serious diseases greatly increase. Researchers in sleep medicine have identified an extensive list of sleep disorders, and thus leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate their analysis and gain a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and related disorders. In this research, we seek a Machine Learning (ML) solution that will allow for efficient classification of unlabeled instances as being Sleep Apnea, Insomnia or Normal (subjects without a specific sleep disorder) by assessing the performance of two well-established strategies for multi-class classification tasks: the One-Vs-All (OVA) and One-Vs-One (OVO). In the context of the specific strategies, two well-known binary classification models were assumed, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Both strategies’ validity was verified upon a dataset of diverse information related to the profiles (anthropometric data, sleep metrics, lifestyle and cardiovascular health factors) of potential patients or individuals not exhibiting any specific sleep disorder. Performance evaluation was carried out by comparing the weighted average results in all involved classes that represent these two specific sleep disorders and no-disorder occurrence; accuracy, kappa score, precision, recall, f-measure, and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) were recorded and compared to identify an effective and robust model and strategy, both class-wise and on average. The experimental evaluation unveiled that after feature selection, 2-degree polynomial SVM under both strategies was the least complex and most efficient, recording an accuracy of 91.44%, a kappa score of 84.97%, precision, recall and f-measure equal to 0.914, and an AUC of 0.927.",

Mainly two facts stress the importance of psychological/ psychotherapeutical strategies for insomnia: (1) Concepts for non-drug treatment aim at improvement of the symptoms and the underlying cause of the disease and (2) disadvantages of hypnotic therapy such as substance abuse or addiction are avoided. Effective treatment techniques such as patients education and counseling, sleep hygiene, stimulus control and relaxation techniques should be known to every therapist, especially general practitioners who treat the majority of patients haring difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Several other effective behavioural techniques, e.g. sleep restriction, or cognitive therapy, and psychotherapy should be used only by skilled and trained experts. Insomniacs with chronic and severe complaints should be treated by therapists with experience in sleep medicine. Multimodal treatment strategies are provided for by sleep disorder centres and combine effective treatment elements in structured therapeutic concepts. There is absolute consensus of opinion that every hypnotic treatment of an insomniac patient should be combined with basal elements of non-drug treatment strategies.",

Neuromuscular diseases include neuronopathies, neuropathies, myasthenic syndromes, and myopathies. An accurate neurological examination and complementary investigations are necessary for both diagnosis and for evaluating the severity of the disease. Assessment of respiratory muscle function is a key step in deciding the need for mechanical ventilation and subsequently its weaning. Hypercapnia often indicates an impending respiratory arrest, but normocapnia, which can be seen in a patient with severe reduction in vital capacity is not reassuring. Hypoxaemia can be due to hypercapnia, pulmonary injury (atelectasis or pneumonia), or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac evaluation is important as cardiomyopathies are frequent in myopathies.",

Sleep-related eating disorder, a parasomnia associated with binge eating during the sleep period, typically with minimal recollection or conscious control, is also associated with weight gain. In some instances, sleep eating episodes may be induced by arousals related to untreated OSA that occur during sleep. A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

A clear and detailed history is important in differential diagnosis of sleepiness because symptoms of sleepiness may be expressed in terms of 'tiredness' or 'fatigue' that do not directly denote sleepiness.

While the prevalence of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome has a pronounced increase across the lifespan (1-3), the prevalence of psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders remains somewhat constant frommiddle to old age (4). Sleep disturbance is a symptom criterion across a number of psychiatric illnesses, including many of the mood and anxiety disorders as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th revision (DSM) (5). Most commonly, the sleep disturbance is in the form of an insomnia complaint and to a lesser extent it relates to hypersomnia and other common disorders of sleep such as sleep apnea. Alterations in sleep architecture are evidenced across a variety of mood and anxiety disorders when sleep is subjected to polysomnographic evaluation. It is also the case that a host of psychotropic medications either alter sleep architecture and/or contribute to subjective sleep complaints.",

      "title": "Apnea",
      "abstract": "Apnea, from the Greek \"absence of breath,\" refers clinically to the partial or complete cessation of respiratory flow. Three types of apnea differ in their underlying pathophysiology as well as in their clinical presentations. Central apnea is the absence of respiratory effort from failure of brainstem neurons to generate an excitatory impulse and subsequently stimulate respiratory muscles. Obstructive apnea results from partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway despite normal brainstem excitation. Mixed apnea is characterized by both central and obstructive components. Understanding the differences among central, obstructive, and mixed apnea is essential for selecting appropriate and effective treatment.Central apnea can affect term neonates and infants as a consequence of their relatively immature brainstem respiratory centers. Clinically, central apneic episodes are characterized by a lack of chest wall motion and the absence of air flow. Brief episodes of apnea, which are fairly common, simply reflect the immaturity of the neural regulatory system, but an episode lasting more than 20 seconds usually is considered pathologic and may be accompanied by cyanosis, hypotonia, bradycardia, or pallor.Preterm neonates can present with idiopathic apnea of prematurity or with apnea from a variety of serious underlying conditions. The apneic episodes may be central, obstructive, or mixed. Idiopathic apnea, which typically has an onset from the second to the seventh day after birth, results from an immature brainstem in association with an underdeveloped upper airway, giving it a mixed clinical picture. It is the most common type of apnea seen in preterm neonates, with the risk varying inversely to gestational age. Resolution usually occurs by 37 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, but rarely may persist up to 48 weeks.When not idiopathic, apnea in a preterm neonate can be the consequence of a multitude of disease processes, including sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypoglycemia. It is critical to differentiate between a stable preterm neonate who has self-limited idiopathic apnea and one whose apneic episodes signal a serious, potentially fatal illness. Markers that suggest high risk for underlying pathology include apnea on the first day after birth, apnea in infants older than 36 weeks of gestation, episodes associated with cyanosis, and severe episodes requiring intense resuscitation. Any of these factors is a signal for further evaluation and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.Obstructive apnea typically occurs in older children, although it can affect infants. The upper airway may be obstructed in the nose (polyps, hypertrophied adenoids), in the oropharynx (enlarged tonsils, macroglossia), or in the larynx (subglottic stenosis, laryngomalacia). Clinically, children may present with a broad spectrum of findings, including snoring, respiratory distress while sleeping, behavioral problems, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not a benign condition and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and death.Because it can be so diverse in its presentation, OSA is not always easy to diagnose. Frequently, a child does not have obvious symptoms while awake or behaviors resulting from sleep disturbance may be attributed erroneously to another condition, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Failing to take a sleep history is one mistake; not giving serious credence to parental reports of snoring and restless sleep is another. Even when parents are questioned properly about their child's sleep, they may not be aware of habitual snoring. Children may not snore as loudly as adults or the parents may be deeply asleep when their child's snoring is most likely to occur (in the last third of the night, when the body's tone is most relaxed during REM sleep).Overall, 2% to 3% of children have sleep disorders, but a thorough sleep history is particularly important in children at special risk: those who have trisomy 21, craniofacial anomalies (Crouzon or Apert syndromes), or neuromuscular disorders (myotonic dystrophy). The following mnemonic tool created at Brown University's Child Development Center can guide an appropriate sleep history: Between 75% and 100% of children who have OSA snore. A comprehensive sleep history also should include questions about enuresis, which has a strong predictive value for OSA, as well as diaphoresis and hyperextension of the head during sleep.The physical examination findings may be entirely normal in children who have OSA. Careful measurement of weight and height is important; affected children may lose weight and fail to grow because of interrelated difficulties with eating and chronic hypoxemia. The association of obesity with OSA is more prevalent in the adult population; almost 30% of children who have OSA are underweight.The presence of dysmorphic facies, mouth breathing, hyponasal speech, or cleft palate should raise the physician's suspicion for OSA. A careful examination of the nose may reveal obstruction from polyps, septal deviation, hypertrophied adenoids, or even a foreign body. In the oropharynx, the size of the tonsils should be noted on a scale of 0 to 4; macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hypothyroidism), micrognathia (Pierre Robin or Goldenhar sequence), or retrognathia may predispose a child to OSA. A complete neurologic examination is indicated because OSA can be associated with cerebral palsy or hypotonia.Most children who have OSA have no laboratory evidence of their disorder. Polycythemia, respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography are present only in the most severe cases. Radiographs may be useful in determining the cause of OSA. Among children who do not have tonsillar hypertrophy, a lateral neck radiograph can assess the size of the adenoids. In the absence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy, nasopharyngoscopy may assist in determining the cause of OSA.Several different strategies are available for confirming the diagnosis of OSA. Overnight pulse oximetry with in-hospital observation has a high positive predictive value in confirming OSA. At home, parents can record a sleep audiotape, although one limitation of this technique is the inability to identify a component of central apnea. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) can provide additional information when results of a sleep history and audiotape are inconclusive. It evaluates daytime sleepiness by measuring how long it takes a patient to fall asleep at different times. Having a short mean sleep latency (<10 min) during the day is abnormal, but the MSLT is of limited use in pediatrics because excessive daytime sleepiness is more common with obesity, which is not the usual finding among children who have OSA.The gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains polysomnography (PSG). The four essential components of a polysomnogram are a chest wall motion detector, nasal air flow meter, heart rate monitor, and a pulse oximeter. More complex instruments may have a pH probe and provide electroencephalographic monitoring. In 1996, criteria were set to standardize PSG interpretation in children. An abnormal study is defined by an apnea index (AI) greater than 1, an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, blood carbon dioxide levels of 45 mEq/L (45 mmol/L) for more than 60% of sleep time or 50 mEq/L (50 mmol/L) for more than 10% of sleep time, and a minimum oxygen saturation lower than 92%.Not all children suspected of having OSA require PSG, particularly when the indication for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is already clear. PSG can provide critical information when there is uncertainty about the severity of OSA, in the presence of severe neurologic disease, with a very young child, and with a medical condition that might complicate surgical intervention. The major disadvantages of PSG are its expense and the time required for the study.As Drs. Matiz and Roman point out, the association between OSA and obesity is not as strong in children as it is in adults. About one third of children who have OSA actually are underweight, which makes sense, considering how failure to thrive might well be the consequence of poor sleep and chronic hypoxemia in a growing organism. The association of massive obesity with hypoventilation, daytime somnolence, and OSA has been called the Pickwickian syndrome. In fact, the syndrome is misnamed. In Dickens' Pickwick Papers, the hero, although portly, is neither obese nor somnolent, and he is not remarkable for his snoring. Mr. Wardle's young servant, known as \"the fat boy, Joe,\" has all the appropriate characteristics, but \"Joe's syndrome\" doesn't have much of a ring.",

The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

      "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder with several clinical features, such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). However, it is difficult to delineate which sleep disorder causes EDS in patients with PWS because they have several risks of EDS, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), narcolepsy, and manifestation of PWS. We present the case of an obese 11-year-old boy with PWS who experienced EDS and excessive weight gain concurrently. He was diagnosed with PWS at the age of 5 months. At the age of 10 years, he gradually gained weight and developed symptoms of EDS. His attending family doctor referred him to our clinic to assess OSA using nocturnal polysomnography; however, there were no signs of sleep apnea. Results of the multiple sleep latency test did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. We concluded that the EDS in this patient was due to a direct symptom of PWS.",

(OSA) is a respiratory disorder related to common sleep, characterized by repetitive obstruction of the upper airway, intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent awakenings during sleep. The absence of this stimulus generates a lack of respiratory effort, because the diaphragm muscle is not being stimulated. People with this disorder increase the risk of suffering fatigue, daytime sleepiness, psychological disorders, cardiovascular problems and respiratory and physical weakness, among many others. For this reason, the present project presents an electronic device that allows the measurement and / or detection of physical variables related to the diagnosis of OSA, using LabVIEW software. The developed device is non-invasive, designed to measure the distance of the thoracic cavity, the nasal temperature, the respiratory flow and the sound produced by the snoring originated mainly in the trachea.",

The diagnosis of sleeplessness, or insomnia, is primarily based upon a careful, detailed medical and psychiatric history. Clinicians have sought an objective means to measure this symptom and have, therefore, turned to polysomnography. The American Sleep Disorders Association has assessed the available data and produced guidelines for the use of polysomnography in evaluating the symptoms of insomnia. Polysomnography is not required for the routine evaluation of transient or chronic insomnia. Polysomnography is, however, indicated in the evaluation of suspected sleep-related breathing disorders and periodic limb movement disorder, which may occasionally contribute to a complaint of insomnia, particularly in middle-aged or elderly patients. In addition, when the cause of insomnia is uncertain or when behavioral or pharmacologic therapy is unsuccessful, polysomnography may be helpful.",

Quality differentiation is possible in case of good knowledge of semiology of sleep-related epileptic seizure types and epileptic syndromes. Difficulties in identification can lead to further diagnostic mistakes. Parasomnias are the most frequently encountered non-epileptic paroxysmal events in sleep, which are related to both non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM-sleep parasomnias are otherwise referred to as arousal disorders. They could be mistaken for frontal lobe epilepsy seizures, which predominantly occur at night and are not readily accompanied by epileptiform abnormalities on EEG. Other sleep phenomena also should be considered in differentiating nocturnal epilepsies. Obstructive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements in sleep and some sleep episodes sometimes are expressed with a pattern hardly distinguishable from epileptic seizures. Complex approach and appropriate diagnostic algorithm would further help clinicians in this field to better assess any given situation.",

Ictus emeticus has not been reported in Rolandic epilepsy. Out of a population of 1340 children with focal afebrile seizures we studied 24 children who had emetic manifestations in at least one seizure and centrotemporal spikes in at least one EEG. They were of normal neurological status and had a follow-up of at least two years after the last seizure. All children had sleep EEG following sleep deprivation. Two groups of patients were identified. Group A (12 patients) with EEG centrotemporal spikes only and group B (12 patients) with centrotemporal spikes and spikes in other locations. In 21 patients, ictal emetic manifestations culminated in vomiting and in three only nausea or retching occurred. The commonest presentation was ictus emeticus at onset followed by deviation of the eyes or staring, loss of contact and floppiness. In 79%, seizures occurred during sleep. Autonomic status epilepticus occurred in 37.5%. The mean age at onset was 5.3 years. Overall analysis of the clinical and EEG data points out that the vast majority of these patients primarily suffer from Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Twenty patients (83%) had ictal semiology typical of Panayiotopoulos syndrome, but five also had concurrent Rolandic symptoms and four later developed pure Rolandic seizures. The other four patients (17%) had typical Rolandic seizures with concurrent ictus emeticus. These findings suggest a link between Rolandic epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome, the two most important phenotypes of the benign childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome.",

Patients frequently had family histories of some disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness.

      "title": "Hipersonolência diurna e variáveis polissonográficas em doentes com síndroma de apneia do sono",
      "abstract": "A síndroma de apneia obstrutiva do sono (SAOS) caracteriza-se por episódios repetidos de obstrução da via aérea superior, hipoxemia nocturna e fragmentação do sono. A hipersonolência diurna constitui um sintoma frequente nos doentes com esta síndroma, embora possa estar ausente. A sua presença representa uma limitação significativa da qualidade de vida do indivíduo, bem como um aumento da morbilidade e mortalidade da SAOS, visto ser um importante factor de risco para acidentes de viação e laborais, podendo originar alterações cognitivo-comportamentais relevantes. O mecanismo desencadeante de hipersonolência diurna não é claro. Alguns autores relacionaram esta com a arquitectura anormal do sono, o que, no entanto, não foi confirmado por outros investigadores. Alguns estudos salientaram a relação entre a hipersonolência diurna e os níveis de dessaturação nocturna da oxi-hemoglobina, mas este facto não foi comprovado cientificamente. O objectivo do presente trabalho foi analisar quais os mecanismos responsáveis pela sonolência diurna nos doentes com SAOS. Assim, numerosas variáveis registadas no estudo polissonográfico foram compara das em dois grupos de indivíduos com esta patologia, apresentando um deles hipersonolência diurna inequívoca e o outro a total ausência da mesma. Foram avaliados 65 indivíduos seguidos no Departamento Respiratório do Hospital Universitário do Son Dureta (Palma de Maiorca) que possuíam no registo poligráfico nocturno um índice de apneia/hipopneia (IAH) > 20/h. A sonolência excessiva foi determinada utilizando a escala de sono de Epworth (ESE) e o teste de latência múltipla. A sua presença foi considerada sempre que o score de ESE > 10 e o score do teste de latência múltipla < 5 min. A ausência da mesma era determinada por um score de ESE < 10 e um teste de latência > 10 min. Cerca de 25 indivíduos foram excluídos devido a discrepância entre os resultados das referidas determinações. Dos 40 doentes restantes, 23 apresentavam hipersonolência diurna e 17 não. Nenhum dos indivíduos sofria de doença crónica, nomeadamente DPOC, cirrose hepática, disfunção tiroideia, artrite reumatóide, insuficiência renal crónica ou fazia qualquer tipo de medicação. O diagnóstico de SAOS foi estabelecido por polissonografia nocturna com registo de múltiplas variáveis, como sejam electroencefalograma (EEG), electromiograma (EMG) mentoniano, electrooculograma, fluxo oronasal, movimentos toracoabdominais e oximetria de fluxo. Apneia foi definida como a interrupção de fluxo oronasal > 10s e hipopneia como uma redução > 50% do fluxo por um período > 10s associado a uma descida > 4% da SaO2 ou despertar. O índice de apneia/hipopneia (IAH) consiste no somatório do número de apneias e hipopneias por hora de sono. Os estádios do sono foram classificados de acordo com os critérios de Rechtschoffen e Kales. A latência do sono foi definida como o período compreendido entre o acto de deitar e os primeiros 30s do estádio I e a eficiência do sono como a duração do sono nocturno expressa como percentagem do tempo total de permanência no leito. De acordo com os critérios da American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force, os despertares foram definidos como despertares de origem respiratória quando ocorriam 3 s após uma apneia, hipopneia ou ressonar, sabendo que existem outros tipos de despertares (espontâneos, relacionados com os movimentos periódicos dos membros e técnicos). O total de despertares foi determinado pela soma de cada tipo dos mesmos. A hipersonolência subjectiva foi avaliada utilizando a ESE constituída por 8 itens a que são atribuídos um score de 0 a 3. A avaliação objectiva é obtida através do teste de latência múltipla de acordo com as guidelines internacionais. Um score < 5 min traduz hipersonolência diurna e > 10 min a sua ausência. Foram estudados, no total, 23 indivíduos do sexo masculino com hipersonolência diurna (ESE: 17 ± 3; teste latência múltipla: 4 ± 1 min) e 17 sem sonolência excessiva (ESE: 5 ± 2 e teste latência: 16 ± 3 min). Ambos os grupos presentaram um IAH similar (62 ± 18/h versus 60 ± 20/h). Os doentes com hipersonolência possuíam um tempo de latência inferior (11 ± 16 versus 18 ± 18 min) e uma maior eficiência do sono (90 ± 7 versus 82 ± 13%) do que os indivíduos sem sonolência excessiva. Os primeiros apresentavam uma menor oxigenação (Sat O2 mínima 69 ± 12 versus 79 ± 8%; Sat O2 média 87 ± 6 versus 90 ± 5%). A distribuição dos estádios do sono e o índice de despertar não diferiu entre os grupos. Verificou-se, assim, que doentes com SAOS e sonolência diurna excessiva se caracterizavam por um tempo de latência do sono inferior, uma maior eficiência do sono e uma oxigenação nocturna pior em relação aos indivíduos sem hipersonolência diurna. A hipoxemia nocturna parece ser o factor determinante major da hipersonolência diurna dos doentes com SAOS.",

METHODS: Twelve adult patients (aged 21 to 56 years) with idiopathic generalised epilepsy featuring typical absences as the prominent clinical feature were studied.

RESULTS: Neurological examination and neuroradiological investigations were normal in all cases. Clinical findings included a median age at onset of absences of 14 (range 4-32) years, almost constant tonic-clonic seizures (in 83% of patients), frequent episodes of absence status (in 33% of patients), and associated cognitive or psychiatric disturbances. Interictal EEG findings showed normal background activity, generalised paroxysms of spike waves or polyspike waves, and inconstant focal spikes (in five patients); runs of polyspikes were seen during non-REM sleep. Ictal EEG findings showed generalised spike waves at 3 Hz, sometimes preceded by multiple spikes, or more complex EEG patterns with sequences of polyspikes intermingled with spike waves or polyspike waves, showing discharge fragmentation or variation of intradischarge frequency. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that absences persisting in adult life may show particular clinical and EEG patterns, distinct from those in childhood or adolescence.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequently associated with neurological disorders. Sleep disorders interfere with rehabilitation of patients with neurological disorders such as stroke and may increase the severity of their symptoms and recurrence rate of stroke. The treatment of sleep apnea syndrome is particularly important in managing patients with cerebral infarction of whom 50-80% have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Sleep apnea produces not only poor quality sleep but also excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and lack of energy. Sleep problems frequently found in patients with dementia are sleep-wake cycle abnormality, fragmentation of sleep, nocturnal insomnia, decreased slow wave sleep and REM sleep, and sleep disordered breathing. The management of sleep disturbances is very important for controlling symptoms such as nocturnal wandering and sundowning syndrome in patients with dementia. Parkinson's disease and epilepsy are other neurological disorders that may have sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "The distinction between epileptic and nonepileptic events out of sleep may represent a significant challenge to the pediatrician. It is known that sleep can facilitate epileptic activity and that seizures in sleep tend to occur during specific sleep stages. Certain epilepsy syndromes have a well-documented and strong association with sleepand these can present with a variety of bizarre behaviors and motor activity. Disorders that may present with nocturnal nonepileptic paroxysmal events may include not only sleep-related disorders per se but also psychiatric/behavioral conditions\"benign\" paroxysmal phenomena with unrelated etiology, and nonneurologic disorders. These phenomena, especially when involving complex motor activity, such as that observed in parasomnias, nocturnal panic attacks, and rapid eye movement behavior disorders may be difficult to differentiate from seizures. Moreover, there is increasing awareness that certain sleep disorders, such as sleep-disordered breathing, may coexist with epilepsy. There are several clinical and electrographical features that allow an accurate diagnosis, and diagnostic tools such as video-EEG polysomnography may be essential.",

In addition, persistence of muscle tone by electromyographic criteria or excessive muscle twitching during REM sleep or both have been reported in treated and untreated narcoleptic patients. We report that another previously described abnormality of REM sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder, may also be a symptom of narcolepsy. This disorder was found in 10 narcoleptic patients during routine clinical evaluations involving polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests. During REM sleep, 7 additional narcoleptic patients displayed persistent muscle tone and/or excessive twitching, which we believe to be subclinical components of REM sleep behavior disorder. These 17 patients, diagnosed by established criteria for narcolepsy and for REM sleep behavior disorder, ranged in age from 8 to 74 years. Seventy-one percent were male. Narcolepsy and REM sleep behavior disorder most commonly emerged in tandem. In 3 patients, treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy with stimulants and tricyclics either induced or exacerbated REM sleep behavior disorder.",

From the day of deprivation - in the self-rating from the 4th day - up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

Research has shown that as many as 50% of older adults complain about difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Elderly with varieties of sleep complaints are differentially affected by 'age-related cognitive decline'. Normal developmental processes have been affected with changes in sleep, which can be further compromised by sleep disturbances secondary to medical or psychiatric diseases such as chronic pain, depression, dementia or age-related primary sleep disorders (e.g., sleep disordered breathing and periodic limb movements during sleep), or certain combinations of these high-risk factors. Sleep serves as a protective mechanism to keep the organism out of danger; therefore, it is imperative to consider sleep disorders for quality life.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by repetitive episodes of narrowing or complete closure of the upper respiratory tract during sleep, leading to sleep disruption and lowering of blood oxygen levels. OSA is the most common sleep breathing disorder that impacts many facets of health-related quality of life and increases risk of comorbidities. At a societal level, OSA leads to a reduced productivity levels caused by impaired cognitive functions and absenteeism and an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. Purpose of research: This review provides a comprehensive overview on current state of knowledge regarding OSA, its impact on work economics and available treatment. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature review based on publicly available Google Scholar, Scopus and PubMed databases from 2010 to 2024 using the following phases: “obstructive sleep apnea”, “daytime sleepiness”, “absenteeism in obstructive sleep apnea”, “economic costs of obstructive sleep apnea”, “treatment of obstructive sleep apnea”. Results and conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is becoming an increasingly common disorder contributing to a number of comorbidities, as well as negatively affecting work productivity and economics. The link between OSA and motor vehicle accidents highlights the importance of screening tests for OSA, especially among the population of professional drivers. Existing treatment methods, especially CPAP treatment, help alleviate OSA symptoms as well as its negative impact on work productivity, which makes it crucial for improving quality of life of patients suffering from OSA.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

      "abstract": "Asphyxia describes any condition that results in oxygen deprivation and, in the unborn or soon-to-be-born infant, may occur prenatally in utero, during delivery or postnatally [1]. In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "abstract": "Snoring is a common phenomenon and a primary symptom in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a sleep-related breathing disorder in which neuropsychological function is reported to be impaired. The first purpose of the present study was to compare cognitive and motor function in 25 heavy nonapneic snorers and 26 sleep apneics. As the basis for impairments in heavy nonapneic snorers is still unclear, the influence of nighttime breathing disturbances and morning alertness, respectively, on daytime performance was evaluated too. Nonapneic snorers exhibit more slow wave sleep and tend to have fewer changes in sleep stage than sleep apnea patients, but values for other sleep variables are similar. Snorers also show comparable alertness. Deficits in immediate visual memory and in visuospatial reasoning are not found. However, there are some indications that snorers show decreased manual dexterity and eye-hand coordination for the nonpreferred hand and that they have deficits in focused attention. In addition, snorers may show difficulties in finger-tapping speed. These performance measures tend to be associated with reduced morning alertness, except for the score on focused attention which has a tendency to be related to the nocturnal breathing disturbances.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in childhood: a review.",
      "abstract": "Several studies in the last ten years have been directed towards a better understanding of sleep disorders in childhood. Defining sleep disorders in this age is difficult in dependence of relevant differences in sleep patterns at subsequent developmental stages. In new-borns total sleep time is fairly equal during night and day. Normally, day-time sleep gradually decreases over the first three years of life, such that night-time sleep progressively increases till the age of four, and similar to adult sleep-time by adolescence. The most frequent sleep disorders observed in childhood are parasomnias, that, thought to be a CNS sign of immaturity, tend to be quite predictable, recurring in the same families and not even influenced by environmental stimuli. These disorders included: a) arousal disorders, that generally emerge from delta sleep or relate to arousals occurring during NREM sleep, very common in childhood and fairly common in adulthood either; b) somnambulism and somniloquy, that have many common characteristics: first of all, they have the potential to generate a great sense of discomfort and fear in parents watching a child who suddenly sits up in bed eyes-opened but 'unseeing'; c) nocturnal enuresis, that is substantially not a problem of depth of sleep, despite many parents believe. Although narcolepsy is more common in adolescence, many studies have demonstrated that narcoleptic symptoms may begin in childhood. Narcoleptic symptoms in children are similar in their appearance to those predominant in adults, but their expression may be different because of CNS maturational factors. Historical descriptions of the OSAS evidenced since the beginning the importance of neurobehavioral complications associated with the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth accompanied by respiratory effort, deriving from upper airway obstruction which occurs during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

All-night polysomnographic recordings with video monitoring showed episodes of teeth grinding or clenching occurring exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which were often associated with movements of the hands and fingers and/or brief vocalization. Throughout REM sleep, there was excessive phasic chin electromyographic twitching, without increased tone, and also excessive phasic electromyographic twitching in multiple muscle sites. The patient maintained a normal nonrapid eye movement-REM cycle, but showed increased REM density. Polysomnographic characteristics suggested that there may be a common pathophysiology in a certain type of sleep bruxism and the REM sleep behavior disorder. Sleep bruxism seen in this case is concluded to be a manifestation of subclinical REM sleep behavior disorder.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is common: its cardinal symptoms can give rise to confusion with epilepsy \n\nNarcolepsy is a distinctive but underdiagnosed disorder of sleep and waking. Its cardinal manifestations are: ( a ) excessive daytime sleepiness, with a tendency to nap repeatedly through the day; ( b ) cataplexy, a loss of muscle tone triggered by emotion, causing immobility for seconds to minutes; ( c ) hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid visual or auditory phenomena, experienced at the onset of sleep; and ( d ) sleep paralysis, an inability to move on first awakening.1\n\nWhen a patient describes all these symptoms the diagnosis should be straightforward. Diagnostic difficulty arises when patients present with isolated symptoms, or if their story suggests some more familiar diagnosis. We report on three patients recently encountered in whom narcolepsy was initially mistaken for epilepsy. Indeed, Gelineau, the French physician who coined the term “narcolepsy” in 1880, was at pains to distinguish his novel disorder of sleep (narco from the Greek for “sleep” and “lepsy” for taken hold by) from epilepsy, with which he thought it might be confused. 2 3\n\nCase 1— A 26 year old woman was found in the bath “unable to move, speak, or get out.” Her husband reported flickering of the eyelids and muscle twitching. Her speech was slurred as she recovered, over minutes. The referral letter noted a history of short periods of apparent daytime sleep, sometimes at inappropriate moments—for example, during meals—and a tendency to “go weak and limp … if she is having a carry-on or laughing heartily.” The diagnosis at referral was of complex partial seizures; sodium valproate had been prescribed. It emerged that she had clear recall of her period of immobility in the bath: it resembled her episodes of weakness on laughing. On direct questioning she described sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. She tended to sleep …",

      "abstract": "Summary Epilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures &gt;24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring &gt;24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age‐dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure‐free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. “Resolved” is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of “remission or “cure.” Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use.

As of June 2020, given the terminology \"post COVID-19\". Reported studies are related to complications of the female patient, including effects on the immune system, physiology, or psychological health, and effects on pre-existing diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and tuberculosis (TB). However, six months after recovery from COVID-19, complications arise, including cough, fever, breathlessness, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, dyspepsia, sleep difficulties, anxiety or depression, higher stress levels, physical decline, post-activity polypnea, alopecia, chest tightness, palpitations, intestinal blockages, impaired respiratory functions, neurological issues, olfactory dysfunction, cognition, dexterity, conversation, disabilities of sight, or listening. Along with other miscellaneous complications such as Miller-Fisher syndrome. Overall, these reviews summarise studies conducted on pre-existing diseases in female patients after COVID-19, complications in female patients with immune dysfunction, including hormonal imbalances, and CSF-insufficiency in female patients with neurodegeneration complications. It observed high levels of molecular markers such as tau protein (t-tau, p-tau), plasma amyloid-beta (A42), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament light chain protein. In Female patients with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2) complications reported higher levels of sCr, C-reactive protein, TN-I, white blood cell, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels, enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation factors, and female patients with tuberculosis (TB) complications had lower aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) and E2 hormone levels.",

      "title": "Excessive daytime sleepiness in sleep disorders.",
      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a significant public health problem, with prevalence in the community estimated to be as high as 18%. Sleepiness is caused by abnormal sleep quantity or sleep quality. Amongst others, multiple neurological, psychological, cardiac and pulmonary disorders may contribute. Risk factors for excessive sleepiness include obesity, depression, extremes of age and insufficient sleep. In the clinical setting, two of the most commonly encountered causes are obstructive sleep apnoea and periodic limb movement disorder. There is continuing discussion of the mechanisms by which these disorders cause daytime symptoms, with intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and autonomic dysregulation identified as important factors. The increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in obese subjects does not fully account for the increased rates of daytime sleepiness in this population and there is evidence to suggest that it is caused by metabolic factors and chronic inflammation in obese individuals. Sleepiness is also more common in those reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders and significantly impacts their quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of factors which put their patients at high risk of daytime sleepiness, as it is a debilitating and potentially dangerous symptom with medico-legal implications. Treatment option should address underlying contributors and promote sleep quantity and sleep quality by ensuring good sleep hygiene. However, stimulant medication may be indicated in some cases to allow for more normal daytime functioning.",

However, sleep phenotypes in the non-Alzheimer dementias remain poorly characterised. Here we describe an analysis of sleep symptoms in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We administered a questionnaire assessing sleep quantity and quality and related hypnic symptoms to primary caregivers of 40 patients representing all major syndromes of FTD in relation to patients with typical AD and logopenic aphasia. Sleep symptoms of variable severity were reported for all patient groups, with frequency varying between syndromes (progressive nonfluent aphasia 82%, behavioural variant FTD 54%, semantic dementia 44%, logopenic aphasia 33%, typical AD 33%). Symptoms reported included vivid or disturbing dreams, nocturnal restlessness and spending significant time in bed not sleeping (particularly in behavioural variant FTD) and daytime sleepiness (particularly in progressive nonfluent aphasia). Sleep disturbance is a significant clinical issue in FTD and may be more frequent and severe than in AD. FTD syndromes may be further stratified by the features of their hypnic phenotype. The findings suggest that a more detailed longitudinal and electrophysiological analysis of sleep in FTD is warranted.",

Features that are typical of both narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are daytime naps, insomnia, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations.

The prevalence of narcolepsy with cataplexy in USA and the countries of Western Europe is from 0.05-0.067%. Its presence is significantly higher in Japan and lower in Israel. Most of the symptoms of narcolepsy represent the abnormal manifestations of dissociated REM sleep process. Excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks and cataplexy are the most frequent symptoms. The diagnosis of narcolepsy should be confirmed by a whole-night polysomnographic recording followed by a Multiple sleep latency test. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a rare disease (ten times as rare as narcolepsy) with the diagnostic procedure similar to that of narcolepsy. Treatment of hypersomnias is symptomatic with the aimed to reduce the most frequent symptoms (excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, cataplexy and hypnagogic/hypnapompic sleep paralyses).",

      "abstract": "Since the first description of narcolepsy at the end of the 19th Century, great progress has been made. The disease is nowadays distinguished as narcolepsy type 1 and type 2. In the 1960s, the discovery of rapid eye movement sleep at sleep onset led to improved understanding of core sleep-related disease symptoms of the disease (excessive daytime sleepiness with early occurrence of rapid eye movement sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement parasomnia), as possible dysregulation of rapid eye movement sleep, and cataplexy resembling an intrusion of rapid eye movement atonia during wake. The relevance of non-sleep-related symptoms, such as obesity, precocious puberty, psychiatric and cardiovascular morbidities, has subsequently been recognized. The diagnostic tools have been improved, but sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods on polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test remain key criteria. The pathogenic mechanisms of narcolepsy type 1 have been partly elucidated after the discovery of strong HLA class II association and orexin/hypocretin deficiency, a neurotransmitter that is involved in altered rapid eye movement sleep regulation. Conversely, the causes of narcolepsy type 2, where cataplexy and orexin deficiency are absent, remain unknown. Symptomatic medications to treat patients with narcolepsy have been developed, and management has been codified with guidelines, until the recent promising orexin-receptor agonists. The present review retraces the steps of the research on narcolepsy that linked the features of the disease with rapid eye movement sleep abnormality, and those that do not appear associated with rapid eye movement sleep.",

There are other disorders such as shift work disorder and jet lag disorder in which the circadian clock timekeeping mechanism is normal but the problems arise due to mismatch caused by extrinsic factors (night or early morning shift work and air travel across multiple time zones).

Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as difficulty staying awake during the usual waking hours. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to be 18–20% in the United States. EDS may occur as a result of numerous conditions, including insufficient sleep or other central disorders of hypersomnolence, sleep-related breathing disorders, medications or substances, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, psychiatric or neurological disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, pregnancy, and various metabolic disorders and medical conditions. True sleepiness is the propensity to fall asleep and is not synonymous with fatigue or always associated with decreased vigilance. Excessive self-reported subjective sleepiness on validated scales such as the ESS may be useful for suggesting the presence of a possible sleep disorder requiring evaluation. However, patients may misinterpret fatigue associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as sleepiness or have an inaccurate perception of the degree of their sleepiness. Objective tests of sleepiness may be helpful to determine whether an abnormal propensity to fall asleep is present. The assessment and diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is usually made based on a combination of sleep history, past medical, psychiatric, surgical, and family history, a physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

Dreams frequently accompanied the onset of sleep. The EEG correlated with the clinical picture in that the normal alpha-rhythm underwent flattening and then a typical paradoxical sleep pattern occurred. All-night sleep EEG showed immediate onset of REM sleep with zero latency. In addition there was instability with prevalence of the light sleep phase over deep sleep, prolonged awakening and an increase in the amount of REM sleep. Under medication with imipramine (30 mg/day) the patient experienced no cataplectic attacks and could return to work.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Report a relation between idiopathic Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder and periventricular nodular heterotopic gray matter in a patient with partial epilepsy. Background: Heterotopic gray matter has been associated with epilepsy, there are no reports of gray matter heterotopia in association with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. Design/Methods: Case report Results: We followed a 41 year old man with history of focal seizures with dyscognitive features since age of 15 years and REM sleep behavior disorder for the past 10 years. He is on Lamotrigine and Clonazepam. His seizures were initially controlled on Lamotrigine then became more frequent. His neurological exam revealed no features of Parkinson’s disease including rigidity, bradykinesia or rest tremor. His gait was normal. He was admitted to our epilepsy monitoring unit for evaluation of his seizures and we recorded REM sleep behavior disorder. MRI brain revealed bilateral periventricular nodules of heterotopic gray matter. There was no hippocampal abnormalities. The pathophysiology of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is due to dysfunction of brainstem nuclei that regulate REM sleep. While it is proven that iRBD is associated with gray matter volume reduction in pontine tegmentum one study revealed that both hippocampi of patients with iRBD show increase in gray matter density as measured by Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM). This reflects a possible neuronal reorganization in this area. Relationship between epilepsy and iRBD exists. iRBD can occur in patients with epilepsy and epileptiform discharges can be recorded in patient with iRBD. Heterotopic gray matter is associated with epilepsy but no reports have associated it with iRBD. Further studies are needed to expand the spectrum of MRI abnormalities in REM sleep behavior. Conclusions: Epilepsy and structural MRI abnormalities were reported to exist with iRBD. To our knowledge this is the first case reporting a co-existence of iRBD with heterotopic gray matter.

S disturbances have been shown to increase risk and/or exacerbate psychiatric and physical health problems in many different populations. However, few studies have examined the relationships among sleep, psychiatric, and cognitive functioning in Veterans with TBI.\r\nMethods: Retrospective chart reviews of 137 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI referred for cognitive rehabilitation at the Veteran Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.\r\nResults: 100% of Veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory [PSQI] global scores >5). Veterans also reported clinically relevant impairments in sleep latency (50 minutes), total sleep time (5.5 hours), and sleep efficiency (77%). More severe sleep problems were related to greater endorsement of depressive, post-concussive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Conversely, sleep disturbance showed limited associations with objective neuropsychological assessment. Overall measures of affective functioning were significantly associated with global measures of sleep quality, though such relationships were not observed for quantitative measures of sleep.\r\nConclusions: Veterans with mild to moderate TBI exhibit very high rates of sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with higher levels of comorbid psychiatric symptomatology, particularly affective complaints. The high prevalence of sleep problems in Veterans with a history of TBI underscores a need to develop both a better understanding of etiologic mechanisms relating brain injury and sleep and a better clinical appreciation of the ramifications of sleep disturbance on daily functioning and recovery in individuals who experience TBI.",

      "title": "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants",
      "abstract": "The amount, timing, and structure of REM sleep are regulated. Three major determinants in REM sleep regulation have been identified: (1) the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which through its outputs generates daily cycles in REM sleep propensity; (2) a homeostatic (i.e., need-based) drive for REM sleep that increases in the absence of REM sleep and decreases during its presence; (3) the inhibition of REM sleep by non-REM (NREM) sleep. In humans, the circadian modulation of REM sleep shows a maximum shortly after the nadir of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature. A sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep (i.e., a gradual increase of REM sleep in the course of a sleep episode that is distinct from a circadian influence) is also evident and attributed primarily to the decrease in NREM sleep intensity. The circadian rhythm and the sleep-dependent disinhibition of REM sleep are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of REM sleep within a sleep episode. In humans that are normally entrained to the 24-hour day, the interaction of these two factors results in maximal REM sleep propensity in the morning, coinciding with habitual wake time. The homeostatic regulation counteracts deviations from a reference level of REM sleep need such that loss of REM sleep results in increased REM sleep propensity. However, rebounds in REM sleep following selective deprivation often remain partial suggesting that the homeostatic drive is relatively weak. On the other hand, recent studies have emphasized that REM sleep can undergo changes in its quality that may compensate for its loss in duration. In the present chapter, the evidence for circadian and homeostatic regulation of REM sleep will be reviewed, the physiological markers that are indicative of such regulation will be presented, and the interdependence of REM sleep and NREM sleep regulation will be examined.",

On the other hand, very common conditions such as insomnia or restless legs syndrome are still neglected or ignored by the vast majority of the medical community. Thus, expanding the knowledge on both respiratory and nonrespiratory sleep disorders may contribute to improve sleep medicine quality amongst respiratory physicians. In this overview, sleep disorders have been described according to the 2nd International Classification of Sleep Disorders published in 2005, i.e. insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, hypersomnias, parasomnias, circadian disorders and movement disorders. Lastly, excessive daytime sleepiness being a major concern for the respiratory physicians dealing with sleep, the differential diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness has been further detailed.",

Based on the medical literature and expert clinical experience, the task force developed a consensus diagnostic criteria for RSD and scoring large muscle group movements in children aged 6–18 years. Eight essential criteria of RSD include a complaint of restless sleep, observed large body movements during sleep, video-polysomnographic documentation of ≥5 large body movements/hour, occurrence at least thrice weekly for at least 3 months, clinically significant impairment, and differentiation from other conditions that may secondarily cause restless sleep. There is evidence to support a pathophysiology based on iron deficiency, sleep instability, and increased sympathetic activation, and treatment options include oral or intravenous iron supplementation. This review describes the key features of RSD, potential pathophysiology, and current treatment options to help diagnose patients with RSD, which has been overlooked.",

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Additionally, decreased sleep duration proved to be the best predictor of a manic state the following day in patients afflicted with rapid cycling bipolar disorder [6]. Since mania in turn causes insomnia, the development of mania is potentially self-reinforcing and could become autonomous after being initiated by precipitating factors [11]. Repeatedly, the importance of adequate treatment of sleep disturbance has been underscored over the centuries [4] [8].",

The application of selective and total PSD techniques caused no noticeable changes in the functional state and integrative activity of the brain, the latter warranting its successful use for treatment of some psychoneurological disturbances in clinics.

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

Hypersomnia reduces the quality of life, complicates socialization, can provoke insomnia, impulsive behaviour, and even depression or suicidal tendencies. The causes of increased daytime sleepiness may be non-compliance with sleep hygiene, nighttime sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, etc.). If these conditions are excluded, you need to pay attention to rare forms of sleep pathology included in the group of central hypersomnia. Aim of the review: to determine the prevalence, pathogenesis, clinic, diagnosis, and treatment of hypersomnia in children. Among the central hypersomnia, narcolepsy is more common than the rest in the population. Idiopathic hypersomnia and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more rare forms of pathology. The pathogenesis of central hypersomnia has not yet been sufficiently studied, disorders of the immune system are of key importance, but there may be other causes. The leading clinical manifestation is daytime sleepiness, which worsens the child’s quality of life. In the diagnosis of hypersomnia, polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MTLS) are of key importance, in some cases other diagnostic methods (MRI) should be used. Pharmacotherapy relieves the condition in sick children, but does not completely eliminate the symptoms. New medicines are being developed. Treatment of hypertension should be comprehensive, not limited to drug therapy.",

Inadequate sleep may impact children's development, mood and behaviour and in consequence the wellbeing of their parents and caregivers. In a prospective, randomised, multicenter, open, comparative clinical trial the effectiveness of homeopathic ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (Cypripedium pubescens D4, Magnesium carbonicum D10, Zincum valerianicum D12) in children with sleep disorders and restlessness was evaluated. <h3>Methods</h3> Children aged≤6 years, suffering from sleep disorders for≥1 month, were randomised to receive either ZinCyp-3–02 tablets (intervention) or the aminoacetic acid glycine (control) for 28 days. Effectiveness endpoints included the change of 7 sleep related complaints (SRC; time to sleep onset, difficulties maintaining sleep, sleep duration, troubled sleep (somniloquism), physical inactivity after awakening, restlessness for unknown reason, sleep disorders frequency; total score = maximum 11 points) and parent's treatment satisfaction. Safety parameters were the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the tolerability of the treatments. <h3>Results</h3> The SRC total score decreased from baseline median 7.0 points in both groups to 2.0 points in the intervention group (n=89 children) and 4.0 points in the control group (n=90 children) after 28 days of treatment. Children of the intervention group had overall significant higher odds of getting lower SRC total score (odds ratio: 4.45 (95%-CI: 2.77–7.14), p&lt;0.0001; ITT). First clinical differences between both groups were seen already after 14 days. At day 28 significantly more children in the intervention group showed absence of individual complaints (Chi<sup>2</sup>-test: all P values≤0.0475; ITT). More parents were either 'very satisfied' (n=33) or 'satisfied' (n=49) with ZinCyp-3–02 treatment compared to the number of parents with 'very satisfied' (n=10) and 'satisfied' (n=28) ratings in the control group. Only few ADRs occurred (ZinCyp-3–02: n=2 (nervousness, excitability); control: n=1 (excitement)) and almost all parents and physician (&gt;93% out of 179) rated the tolerability of both treatments as 'very good' or 'good'. <h3>Conclusions</h3> ZinCyp-3–02 showed to be a safe and effective treatment option for paediatric sleep disorders and restlessness.",

      "abstract": "Perspectivesver long periods oftime, months and years, arterial Pco2 and P02 are closely regulated, but over shorter periods, constancy of arterial blood gas tensions is perhaps an impractical or even an undesirable objective.It is now appreciated that fluctuation within limits is an inherent feature ofnormal function and that there are cycles of activity and rest that modify re- spiratory regulation as well as other regulatory processes (1, 2).Many of these cycles, like the sleep-waking cycle, are circadian, with a period of -24 h, and seem to be keyed to the revolution of the earth.Sleep, like breathing, seems to be essential to health, and adverse physiological and psychological consequences occur with sleep deprivation (3, 4).However, the need to adjust breathing to physiological requirements during both sleep and wakefulness complicates the task of the respiratory control system because sleep alters the response characteristics of the respiratory con- troller and the performance of the respiratory muscles.There may be a hierarchy of neurological organization that governs physiological regulations that determines priorities and arbitrates among conflicting demands as activity levels change.In some individuals with the sleep apnea syndrome, adequate sleep and sufficiently stable breathing, both necessary to prevent dangerous fluctuations in blood gas tensions, seem to be in- compatible (5,6).Sleep is interspersed with periods when airflow stops and profound hypoxemia develops.Sometimes it seems as if death is averted only by arousal and the termination of sleep.While the biochemical basis of neither sleep nor breathing are known, much has been learned in recent years about sleep and about the mechanisms by which it affects respiratory control.Several effective methods of treatment of the sleep apnea syn- drome have been developed based on our understanding of the effects of sleep on breathing.Breathing during sleep.Neither sleep nor wakefulness are uniform states.Even in awake individuals, cyclic changes in breathing with both long and short periods can be obvious at altitude and can be discerned at sea level by sophisticated math-",

      "title": "Defining obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a failure of semantic rules",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is one of the most ubiquitous medical conditions in industrialised society. Since the recognition that symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence, problems with concentration, mood and cognitive impairment, as well as cardiometabolic abnormalities can arise as a consequence of obstructed breathing during sleep, it has been subject to variation in its definition. Over the past five decades, attempts have been made to standardise the definitions and scoring criteria used for apnoeas and hypopnoea, which are the hallmarks of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, applying these definitions in clinical and research practice has resulted in over- and under-estimation of the severity and prevalence of OSAS. Furthermore, the definitions may eventually become redundant in the context of rapid technological advances in breathing measurement and other signal acquisition. Increased efforts towards precision medicine have led to a focus on the pathophysiology of obstructed breathing during sleep. However, the same degree of effort has not been focused on how and why the latter does or does not result in diurnal symptoms, integral to the definition of OSAS. This review focuses on OSAS in adults and discusses some of the difficulties with current definitions and the possible reasons behind them.",

      "abstract": "Summary Restless sleep disorder (RSD) is an important sleep disorder characterised by the presence of frequent large muscle movements (LMM) during sleep, which may be comorbid to other conditions/diseases. In this study, we investigated the frequency and the characteristics of RSD among children who were evaluated by polysomnography (PSG) due to epileptic and non‐epileptic nocturnal attacks. We analysed consecutively children younger than 18 years who were referred for PSG recording due to abnormal motor activities during sleep. The diagnosis of nocturnal events as sleep‐related epilepsy was made based on the current consensus. Patients who were referred with suspicion of sleep‐related epilepsy, but who were diagnosed to have non‐epileptic nocturnal events and children with a definitive diagnosis of NREM sleep parasomnias were also enrolled. Sixty‐two children were analysed in this study (17 children with sleep‐related epilepsy, 20 children with NREM parasomnia, and 25 children with nocturnal events not otherwise classified [neNOS]). The mean number of LMM, LMM index, LMM‐associated with arousal and its index were all significantly higher in children with sleep‐related epilepsy. Restless sleep disorder was present in 47.1% of patients with epilepsy, 25% of patients with parasomnia, and in 20% of patients with neNOS. The mean A3 duration and the A3 index were higher in children with sleep‐related epilepsy and RSD compared with those with parasomnia and restless sleep disorder. Patients with RSD had lower ferritin levels than those without RSD in all subgroups. Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of restless sleep disorder in children with sleep‐related epilepsy, associated with an increased cyclic alternating pattern.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Sleep medicine has a relatively short history compared to other medical fields, thus, many sleep disorders are not familiar to the general public and even to physicians. In this small review about various sleep disorders, I will briefly introduce basic concepts about insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorder, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, parasomnia and sleep-related movement disorders. These sleep disorders are frequently encountered in clinical settings, and understanding them will give us insight about the basic mechanism of sleep-wake states.",

Symptoms of N1 commonly include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Ethnic differences have been observed, but they have not been reported in an Ethiopian patient to date.CASE DETAIL: We report a 39-year-old Ethiopian patient with type 1 narcolepsy whose diagnosis was delayed for three decades despite severe symptoms. Her quality of life was significantly impaired and included EDS, sleep fragmentation, and depression. The mean sleep latency (MSL) for five naps was 1.3 minutes. Sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) were present in all five nap periods. HLA-typing and a CSF hypocretin level testing were not performed. Modafinil 300mg was prescribed, which improved her quality of life.CONCLUSION: In developing countries where diagnostic studies are not available, practitioners should pay special attention to a detailed history and look for classic symptoms of narcolepsy to establish an early diagnosis and improve quality of life.",

One notes a predilection for certain types of epilepsy to occur in sleep, such as benign focal epilepsy of childhood, or to occur shortly after awakening (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Epilepsy may disrupt the sleep architecture with an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep sleep, and an increase in awake time after sleep onset.

Attacks can be precipitated or made worse by cold, rest after exercise, anesthesia, potassium loading, hunger, emotional stress, pregnancy and glucocorticoids (2). Sleep has not been well described as one of the triggers for paralysis. HPP can be confused with sleep paralysis and in some cases with cataplexy. Many patients go undiagnosed for decades. Neurology and sleep literature is lacking in sleep associated periodic paralysis.\n DESIGN/METHODS: Case report\n RESULTS: \nRS is a 61 year old woman with life long sleep onset associated paralysis which has resulted in chronic insomnia and fear of falling asleep. Her paralysis can also be precipitated by eating salted peanuts. She comes from a large family where many members suffer from the same condition (maternal grandmother, mother, sister, two brothers, and daughter) and only one of her brothers has been formally diagnosed. She was referred to sleep medicine clinic to evaluate for “narcolepsy variant” and was diagnosed there with HPP. Genetic testing is pending.\n CONCLUSIONS: \nHPP has varied presentations and should be considered in patients with sleep onset paralysis thus preventing prolonged time to appropriate diagnosis and treatment which can last for decades.\n Study Supported by: Disclosure: Dr. Gorfinkel Pyatkevich has nothing to disclose.",

      "abstract": "Parental concerns about their young children9s sleep are among the most frequent behavior problems discussed with pediatricians. In view of this high prevalence, it is important to review the origins of these problems and emerging information about how best to manage them. Definition Sleep disorders among children can be classified as dyssomnias, parasomnias, and disruptions secondary to other conditions. The dyssomnias are disturbances in the amount or timing of the sleep. They include intrinsic sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea, interactional sleep disorders such as excessive night waking, and sleep phase disorders, when the time the parents assign for sleep and the child9s period of needing it are not synchronous. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as night terrors, nightmares, sleep walking, and sleep talking. Sleep also can be disturbed as the result of various mental and physical conditions, including asthma, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. The dyssomnias (sleep refusal and night waking) and parasomnias (night terrors and nightmares) of infancy and early childhood are the most common complaints of parents to pediatricians. Sometimes, however, parents may not seek help for these problems; at other times, they may be concerned by what actually is normal sleep behavior.",

      "title": "0855 A challenging case of nocturnal visual hallucinations in an elderly woman",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Nocturnal hallucinations can be part of a wide array of different disorders, like sleep disorders (e.g. narcolepsy), visual impairment (e.g. Charles-Bonnet syndrome), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Lewy Body Dementia) and psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). We explore the differential diagnosis, the challenging diagnostic workup and the limited therapeutic options in this patient with complex visual nocturnal hallucinations. Report of Cases: A 64 year old woman was referred with detailed and vivid visual nocturnal hallucinations (seeing her dog smoking a cigar, seeing someone in the room moving her bed, etc.). The hallucinations started 1-2 months ago, were mainly present at night (both when falling asleep and during the night) but occasionally also during the day. She had also been suffering from worsening daytime sleepiness for 3-4 months, and from memory problems for 1 year. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis were absent. Clinical neurological examination was normal. The patient had been diagnosed in the past with OSAS. She had been treated with CPAP for 3 years and recent polysomnography showed good control of her apnea. She had also been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, COPD and cardiomyopathy. Because of her age, the vivid hallucinations, and the memory problems, we first wanted to rule out Lewy Body Dementia. Neuropsychological testing ruled out dementia. MRI of the brain showed some white matter lesions, without substantial atrophy. At a subsequent multidisciplinary consultation, her cardiologist considered her cardiomyopathy as a contraindication for stimulants. Therefore, and because we believed the a priori probability for narcolepsy to be low, an additional MSLT was not considered useful. Based on further pulmonary tests, we hypothesized that hypoxia could play a role in the hallucinations and hypersomnolence. The hallucinations improved over time, the hypersomnolence remained, but we found there were no good treatment options available, considering the cardiac contraindications for stimulants. Conclusion There is a wide-ranging differential diagnosis for nocturnal visual hallucinations. The specific patient characteristics are important both for further diagnosis and treatment options.

      "abstract": "Many patients suffering from the majority of anxiety disorders complain about their sleep by reporting difficulties in initiating and maintaining it. Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in REM sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-REM-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in REM sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep. The early reports of shortened REM latency in OCD could not be replicated by recent studies. A dysregulation of the REM sleep control system has been reported for patients with PTSD. Finally, no significant differences were found in all sleep parameters between social phobia patients and controls.",

      "abstract": "Le lien entre sommeil et épilepsie est fort. L’insuffisance de sommeil ou les pathologies du sommeil peuvent aggraver l’épilepsie mais l’épilepsie elle-même, soit par une action directe soit par le biais des traitements anti-épileptiques, peut perturber le sommeil. De plus, les anomalies épileptiques peuvent être présentes sur les enregistrements polysomnographiques. Dans cette fiche pratique, nous proposons au praticien de médecine du sommeil une mise au point pour identifier les anomalies intercritiques et les crises d’épilepsie qui peuvent poser le problème de diagnostic différentiel avec des parasomnies, pour connaître la prise en charge spécifique du syndrome d’apnées du sommeil chez le patient épileptique et enfin pour comprendre le rôle des anti-épileptiques sur le sommeil. Sleep and epilepsy have a strong mutual relationship. Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders may impair epilepsy but epilepsy may also directly or indirectly disturb sleep (role of the antiepileptic drugs). Furthermore, epileptic discharges may be seen in polysomnographic recordings. In this fact sheet, we propose to provide to sleep medicine practitioners some practical tools to: (1) identify interictal spikes and epileptic seizures, commonly misdiagnosed as parasomnias; (2) know the specific management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in patients with epilepsy, and; (3) understand the role of anti-epileptic drugs on sleep.",

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

In patients with suspected circadian rhythm sleep disorder, continuous temperature monitoring together with sleep log and actigraphy may establish the phase relationship between sleep-wake rhythms and other biological rhythms.

      "title": "0653 WORSENING PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE AFTER BRIEF NAPS IN HYPERSOMNOLENT PATIENTS: MSLT NAP CORRELATES",
      "abstract": "Physiologic sleep inertia is operationalized as cognitive impairments upon awakening. Markedly pronounced sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, is common in idiopathic hypersomnia and may exist on a continuum with physiologic sleep inertia or may represent a distinct entity. Previous work has demonstrated significant worsening of vigilance on Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses (reaction times >500ms) and reciprocal of reaction time (RRT) following brief naps among hypersomnolent patients, but the MSLT correlates of these changes in vigilance are unknown. Patients undergoing PSG/MSLT (N=118; Age=37.38 ± 14.39; 62.71% women), with diagnoses of Idiopathic hypersomnia (n=37), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (n=29), Narcolepsy Type 1 (n=8) and Type 2 (n=6), and subjective sleepiness with normal MSLT (n=30), were administered PVT before and after MSLT naps 2 and 4. PVT performance was analyzed with paired t-tests, mixed-effects, and general linear models. For nap 2, lapses and RRT demonstrated significant worsening post-nap relative to pre-nap, (10.31 ± 18.56 [pre] vs 13.42 ± 20.65 [post]; t= -2.98, p=0.0035 and 3.24 ± 0.87[pre] vs 3.05 ± 0.91[post]; t=5.06, p= <.0001), respectively. Similar results were seen for nap 4 for lapses (t=-3.35, p=0.0011) and RRT (t=3.24, p=0.0016). Sleep duration on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=.80, S.E.=0.22, p=0.001) and worsened RRT (B=.03, S.E.=0.01, p=0.001) post-nap, but not on nap 4. Sleep efficiency on nap 2 was significantly associated with increased lapses (B=-8.57, S.E.=3.96, p=0.032) and worsened RRT (B=.38, S.E.=.14, p=0.006), but not on nap 4. Nocturnal PSG variables (sleep time, sleep efficiency, %N3 sleep, %REM sleep) and PSG/MSLT-based diagnoses were unrelated to PVT change in performance. Despite the generally short amount of accrued sleep time, psychomotor vigilance worsens immediately upon awakening from a morning MSLT nap in hypersomnolent patients, and this worsening is strongly related to amount of sleep obtained/sleep efficiency. This finding has implications for napping recommendations among those with excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

Sie sind meistens klinisch diagnostizierbar, sollten aber im Schlaflabor untersucht werden, wenn die Standardtherapien nicht erfolgreich sind, selbstoder fremdgefährdende nächtliche Verhaltensweisen oder vermehrte Tagesschläfrigkeit auftreten. Während die schlafbezogenen Bewegungsstörungen wie Restless Legs Syndrom und Bruxismus sehr häufig in der Bevölkerung auftreten, handelt es sich bei den Parasomnien um weniger häufig auftretende Erkrankungen, die zudem in ihrer medizinischen Bedeutung oft unterschätzt werden. Die Erforschung der REM Schlafverhaltensstörung, die zu mehr als 70% neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen jahrelang vorausgeht, hat dazu geführt, die Parasomnien in der Neurologie wieder stärker zu beachten.",

      "abstract": "It is estimated that about 25% of children have sleep disorders, from short problems with falling asleep to severe including primary sleep disorders. Majority of these problems are transitory and self-limiting and usually are not recognized by first care physicians and need education.Analysis of sleep structure at the developmental age and of sleep disorders associated with different sleep phases on the basis of video/polysomnography results.Literature review and illustration of fundamental problems associated with sleep physiology and pathology, with special attention to paroxysmal disorders. Additionally 4 cases from our own experience were presented with neurophysiological and clinical aspects.Discussion on REM and NREM sleep, its phases and alternating share according to child's age was conducted. Sleep disorders were in accordance with their international classification. Parasomnias, occupying most of the space, were divided in two groups: primary and secondary. Among primary parasomnias disorders associated with falling asleep (sleep myoclonus, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rhythmic movement disorder, restless legs syndrome) are important. Another disorders are parasomians associated with light NREM sleep (bruxism, periodic limb movement disorder) and with deeper NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnabulism, night terrors), with REM sleep (nightmares, REM sleep behavior disorder) and associated with NREM and REM sleep (catathrenia, sleep enuresis, sleep talking). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and epileptic seizures occurring during sleep also play an important role. Frontal lobe epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome should be considered in the first place in such cases. Our 4 cases document these diagnostic difficulties, requiring video/polysomnography examination 2 of them illustrate frontal lobe epilepsy and single ones myoclonic epilepsy graphy in children is a difficult technique and requires special device, local and trained personnel. It is crucial in gathering objective data about sleep disorders.Correct diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders during sleep in children is possible thanks to video/polysomnography, and enables proper management and pharmacotherpy. It enables improvement or cure disorders during the sleep and moreover enables the obtainment of positive changes in child's every day life.",

Extensive evaluations, including electrophysiologic studies in two patients, were normal. It is therefore suggested that the underlying pathophysiology involved autonomic dysfunction. REM sleep-related sinus arrests such as these, which may occur in apparently healthy subjects but are undetected, may explain some cases of sudden, unexpected death during sleep. Polygraphic monitoring during sleep may be helpful in delineating the pathophysiology of the sleep-related arrhythmia in persons with daytime cardiac arrhythmias thought to be secondary to abnormal vagal tone. The possibility of nocturnal asystole should be considered in patients such as those described here.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are transient abnormal neuronal discharges of the cerebral cortex that often result in stereotyped behavior. Seizure is often a manifestation or symptom of many medical conditions. Epilepsy is the occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder. In other words, a seizure is a sign, and epilepsy is a disorder. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of individuals reaching age 70 will have a seizure, but only 1–2% will be subject to recurrence and become epileptic. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, with normal exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG), 15–30% have recurrence. Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

The disorders that are often observed during the night in PD include sleep fragmentation that may be due to recurrent PD symptoms, sleep apnea, Restless Leg Syndrome/periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorder. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a common occurrence in PD. EDS can arise from several etiologies, and patients may have more than one etiology responsible. The causes of EDS include nocturnal sleep disorder with sleep deprivation and resulting daytime somnolence, the effect of drugs used to treat PD, and possibly neurodegeneration of central sleep/wake areas. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.",

During wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) must display a frequency within the alpha band, although an absent PDR is not abnormal. A symmetrically slowed PDR, excessive theta activity, or any delta activity during wakefulness is abnormal and a biomarker of encephalopathy. Low-voltage EEGs have been associated with a variety of neuropathological states but are themselves not abnormal. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, a normal EEG will display progressively greater degrees of background slowing and amplitude enhancement, which may or may not be associated with specific sleep-related transients. In contrast, the EEG during rapid eye movement sleep more closely resembles a waking EEG (“desynchronized”) in amplitude and background frequencies. Across both wakefulness and sleep, significant asymmetries in background frequencies and amplitude are abnormal.",

In all patients, continuous spike-wave discharges were observed for more than > 80% of the total sleep period at some time during the course of the illness. There are many similarities at the age of onset, the occurrence of several types of seizures, the evolution and the electroencephalographic findings in awake state and sleep.It suggests that the CSWS, LKS and ABPE have probably the same pathophysiology and that they are the severe, moderate and benign forms of a single epileptic syndrome, age-related, with continuous spike waves and various neuropsychological and behavioral disturbances.

The case study of a 60 years old man is based on psychiatric examinations, an intersive one-week observation including polygraphic sleep recordings, and on reviewing medical data over a period of 35 years. In this case, the insomnia developed during a life situation with social stress and continued over 30 years with a gradual sleep reduction to 2-4 hours. Our sleep recordings confirmed a total sleep time of nearly 3 hours, a marked rhythmicity of sleep and day-time activities, fragmentation of sleep, and psychogenic extrasystoles, all symptoms having been reported by the subject previously. Autonomic functions indicated a good efficiency of NREM sleep, whereas a first night effect with subsequent adaptation revealed a good regulatory function of the sleep-waking-system. In addition to a detailed documentation of this extraordinary case, an interpretation is undertaken in order to explain, how the insomnia developed and continued. Psychodynamic aspects show a set of characteristics which are most typical for psychosomatic syndroms. The authors expect, that the knowledge about psychosomatic insomnia will be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of severe insomnias.",

A dream that awakens the dreamer in a terrified state generally with accompanying frightening dream content—a nightmare—would be a psychopathologic dream.

This condition was successfully treated with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) despite the lack of diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) by correction of sleep fragmentation.\r\nTreatment with PAP is well established when catathrenia is associated with OSA but is unclear if no other sleep disorder is present. In the last International Classification of Sleep Disorders, catathrenia has been classified as an isolated symptom, however in this patient, the magnitude of repercussion on her daily life might suggest the need for a recategorization. We hypothesize that the pathophysiologic mechanism is related to upper airway ventilatory instability due to a high arousal index and that secondary sleep fragmentation explains excessive daytime somnolence and fatigue that are reversed with PAP treatment.",

The cases with mental symptoms were studied for the incidence, detail of the symptoms, and the factors involved in their development.1) Mental symptoms were observed in 23 patients and the incidence tended to be highest in the patients in their sixties. 2) In classification of the cases with mental symptoms, 12 cases showed the change of visual experience as main symptom and 3 cases had delusion. In these two cases, disturbance of consciousness was minimum, if any. Eight cases showed delirious state. 3) As for mental symptoms, visual hallucination was most frequently observed. 4) Complication of hypertension and history of depressive state were more frequently observed in the cases with mental symptoms than in those without. 5) Mean daily dose of L-dopa upon the onset of mental symptoms was less than mean daily maximum dose in the cases without mental symptoms. 6) The cases with cerebral atrophy in CT had a tendency to develop mental symptoms. 7) The cases with abnormal EEG were liable to develop mental symptoms. 8) The cases with mental symptoms were more often complicated by dyskinesia than those without.The incidence of mental symptoms during the treatment of Parkinson's disease tended to be high in the aged patients who had all or some of these findings as previous history of psychiatric illness, hypertension, cerebral atrophy and abnormal EEG.",

      "abstract": "Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are visual, tactile, auditory or other sensory events, usually brief but sometimes prolonged, that occur at the transition from wakefulness to sleep (hypnagogic) or from sleep to wakefulness (hypnopompic). Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are often associated with sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis occurs immediately prior to falling asleep (hypnagogic paralysis) or upon waking (hypnopompic paralysis). In 1664, the Dutch physician Isbrand Van Diemerbroeck (1609-1674) published a collection of case histories. One history with the title 'Of the Night-Mare' describes the nightly experiences of the 50-year-old woman. This case report is subject of this article. The experiences in this case could without doubt be diagnosed as sleep paralysis accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations. This case from 1664 should be cited as the earliest detailed account of sleep paralysis associated with hypnagogic illusions and as the first observation that sleep paralysis and hypnagogic experiences occur more often in supine position of the body.",

Some disturbances of the circadian system are responsible for clinical syndromes characterized by chrono-fatigue, one of them being the sleep delayed phase insomnia. Circadian sleep disorders, either functional or structural, are characterized not only by disturbances in sleep architecture and/or sleep quality, but also by the inability to fall asleep and stay awake at desired times. Similarly, sleep and fatigue present in those circadian disorders typically exhibit a daily cyclic pattern. Night workers and shift workers do have chronic sleep deprivation and desynchronisation of their circadian system with the entraining environment. Those phenomena are responsible for severe vigilance problems, a decrease in work productivity and deleterious health side effects. Fatigue and sleep problems in circadian disorders can now benefit from treatments based on the programed use of synchronizers of the circadian clock, like chronotherapy, bright light and melatonin, combined with adequate sleep hygiene recommendations.",

      "title": "F165. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA IS COMMON IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND RESPONDS WELL TO TREATMENT – A NOVEL AND PRACTICAL MEANS TO IMPROVE COGNITION AND METABOLIC HEALTH?",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep, causing hypoxia, frequent arousals and disruption to sleep architecture. OSA is more likely in people who are obese, smoke tobacco, and use alcohol and sedating medications – all these factors are more common in schizophrenia. OSA is likely to be underdiagnosed in schizophrenia as symptoms such as non-restorative sleep, depression and daytime somnolence may be attributed to chronic mental illness. OSA in the normal population is associated with cognitive deficits and poor cardiovascular health, both of which are common in schizophrenia, so comorbid OSA in schizophrenia may be exacerbating these problems. Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces daytime sleepiness, and improves quality of life, cognitive function, and cardiovascular risk factors. There are no published studies of CPAP treatment of OSA in schizophrenia, so it is not known whether these benefits also occur in the patient population. Previous research into OSA in schizophrenia has utilised subjective screening instruments and there are no large studies using polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard method to diagnose OSA. We undertook home sleep studies using polysomnography in 30 people with schizophrenia, treated with clozapine. Participants cooperated well and all studies were of good quality. We treated 6 participants with severe OSA with CPAP. Treatment adherence was good with mean CPAP usage of of 7.7 hours/night. We found that 14/30 (40%) of our participants with schizophrenia had OSA and 8/30 (27%) had severe OSA; twice the prevalence of severe OSA in the general population. After six months CPAP treatment there was significant improvement in cognition, especially verbal memory, working memory and motor skills. Average weight loss was 7.2kg (SD 9k) with a 12mmHg (SD 18) reduction in systolic blood pressure. Normal sleep architecture was restored: on average the percentage of the night spent in restorative slow wave sleep increased from 4.8% to 31.6%, and the percentage in REM sleep from an average of 4.1% to 31.4%. The mean percentage of the night spent in a hypoxic state with oxygen saturation less than 90% reduced from an average of 27.6% to 2%. Improved awareness of the high prevalence of OSA in schizophrenia and access to diagnostic screening by home PSG should ensure this important comorbid condition is not missed. CPAP treatment for OSA in people with schizophrenia is feasible and has the potential to improve both cognition and cardiovascular health, resulting in better functioning and reduced cardiovascular morbidity.",

      "title": "Pathogenesis of Obstructive and Central Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made over the last several decades in our understanding of the pathophysiology of both central and obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea, in its various forms, is generally the product of an unstable ventilatory control system (high loop gain) with increased controller gain (high hypercapnic responsiveness) generally being the cause. High plant gain can contribute under certain circumstances (hypercapnic patients). On the other hand, obstructive sleep apnea can develop as the result of a variety of physiologic characteristics. The combinations of these may vary considerably between patients. Most obstructive apnea patients have an anatomically small upper airway with augmented pharyngeal dilator muscle activation maintaining airway patency awake, but not asleep. However, individual variability in several phenotypic characteristics may ultimately determine who develops apnea and how severe the apnea will be. These include: (1) upper airway anatomy, (2) the ability of upper airway dilator muscles to respond to rising intrapharyngeal negative pressure and increasing Co(2) during sleep, (3) arousal threshold in response to respiratory stimulation, and (4) loop gain (ventilatory control instability). As a result, patients may respond to different therapeutic approaches based on the predominant abnormality leading to the sleep-disordered breathing.",

Inappropriate sleep habits in children have increased in developed countries and have become a major public health concern. Indeed, the impositions of daily life in technologically advanced societies on sleep and wake schedules have markedly shortened the total duration of sleep that children obtain these days. When sleep fragmentation is conducted in healthy adults using auditory stimuli to elicit arousals throughout the night, detriments in performance are clearly apparent the following day. Acute sleep restriction for one night in children has been shown to increase inattentive behavior the following day, although no changes were observed in hyperactive or impulsive behaviors.",

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department.

      "title": "1221 Flumazenil for the treatment of hypersomnolence and fatigue in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with multiple cardiac comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a genetically inherited connective tissue disorder which has a high prevalence of sleep conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, fatigue, and hypersomnia., Chronic fatigue is an important factor in the impaired quality of life in patients with EDS. Successful treatment of fatigue and hypersomnia with traditional wake-promoting medications and stimulants is limited, due to the high prevalence of postural tachycardia, orthostatic intolerance, and other cardiac conditions in these patients. We present a case of EDS with underlying cardiac comorbidities, hypersomnia and fatigue who had significant improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness after treatment with flumazenil. Report of Case A 19 yoF with PMH of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), autonomic instability and well-controlled depression presented with symptoms of fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS of 17/24) despite obtaining 10-15 hours of sleep each day. Polysomnogram followed by MSLT was notable for borderline excessive sleepiness without other abnormalities (PSG: AHI 3/hr, SpO2 nadir 92%; MSLT: 0 SOREMS, mean sleep latency 10 minutes). Prior autonomic and cardiac work-up revealed POTS (maximum HR 180 bpm), orthostatic intolerance and aortic root dilatation. Physical exam and previous laboratory work up for fatigue were unremarkable. A trial of flumazenil 6 mg lozenge every 4-6 hours, as needed for sleepiness, was initiated. On her subsequent visit 6 months later, patient reported 50% improvement in symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness, with decrease in ESS from 17 to 5. No adverse effects to flumazenil were reported. Conclusion Flumazenil is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor antagonist that has been previously documented to provide sustained clinical benefit in treatment-refractory hypersomnolence. This case report highlights a successful alternative treatment option for hypersomnolence in patients with EDS and cardiac comorbidities, in which traditional wake-promoting agents and stimulants may be contraindicated.",

During the past 12 years I have encountered at least six patients with sleep paralysis alone. Narcolepsy or cataplexy were not concurrent, nor was a history of either elicited. Patients generally do not seek help for sleep paralysis in isolation, and as a matter of fact the symptoms apart from those of the narcoleptic triad are apparently not often correctly diagnosed. The dramatic aspects of narcolepsy are more readily identified. When sleep paralysis is mentioned in publications it is usually included in articles stressing narcolepsy.<sup>1</sup>Only a few articles published during the past 20 years have given special attention to various aspects of sleep paralysis, such as psychodynamics and treatment.<sup>2</sup>Since the diagnosis of sleep paralysis appears to be missed often, the affliction probably is more widespread than general physicians and specialists realize.

Clearly many physiological alarm systems produce mounting discomfort and activation but do not lead to a full-fledged maximum reaction unless adaptive action has failed to be effective. Ley obscures the issue by a physiologically unwarranted dictum about how alarm systems work. Central sleep apnea is a pathological feature of the breathing control mechanism; patients with central sleep apnea breathe insufficiently except during full wakefulness.

Retnikov1, V. Hernandez1, A. Cabrera1, A. González1, C. Giménez1 and V. Felipo1 1 Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, Laboratory of Neurobiology, Spain Patients with liver diseases (e.g. cirrhosis) may present hepatic encephalopathy (HE), an alteration in cerebral function which is a consequence of failure of liver function. Patients with HE may present different neurological alterations, as impairment of cognitive or motor functions or altered sleep-wake cycle, which impairs their quality of live. Hyperammonemia is considered a main contributor to the neurological alterations in HE. Animal models of chronic HE (e.g. rats with portacaval shunts) or of ‘‘pure’’ hyperammonemia reproduce some of these impaired cerebral functions. Both hyperammonemia and neuroinflammation contribute to the impairment of cognitive and motor functions. We have found a good correlation between the learning ability and the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in rat cerebellum in vivo. Treatment of rats with chronic HE or hyperammonemia by means of inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5 (that increase levels of cGMP) restores the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in cerebellum as well as the learning ability. The same beneficial effects may be obtained by treating the rats chronically with an anti-inflammatory compound, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen also improves the hypokinesia in rats with portacaval shunts. Hyperammonemic rats also show altered circadian rhythms of activity due to the impairment of the circadian variation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mechanisms involved in the effects of hyperammonemia and inflammation include alteration in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in cerebellum and basal ganglia. The study of these mechanisms in animal models of HE will allow the development of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies: for example, the increase of cGMP levels or anti-inflammatory molecules to improve learning and memory performance in individuals with HE.

      "title": "Neural and Neurobehavioral Dysfunction in Children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Research has confirmed what many parents have long suspected: inadequate sleep in children is associated with daytime behavioral problems and poor academic functioning [1–3]. A fact less well-recognized by clinicians and the general public is that sleep-related breathing disorders, which occur in two to ten percent of children depending on how they are defined, can have a significant impact even among children who have normal sleep duration [4]. Snoring is a hallmark symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, and enlarged tonsils are often a contributing factor to the breathing disturbance. We still do not fully understand the mechanism that links snoring or enlarged tonsils with behavioral problems and poor grades.\r\n\r\nOne of the more severe nocturnal breathing disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), involves partial or complete breathing blockage recurrently during sleep, resulting in intermittent drops in blood oxygen levels and probable sleep disruption. Although brain processes are presumed to mediate the link between these medical factors and daytime behavioral and scholastic problems, our understanding of these processes remains fairly theoretical and speculative. The frontal and hippocampal regions of the brain, which are implicated in the regulation of behavior and memory, respectively, appear to be most vulnerable to OSA [4], but the evidence is indirect.\r\n\r\nIn a new study published in PLoS Medicine, Ann Halbower and colleagues [5] used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can detect chemical metabolites linked to neural dysfunction, to shed more direct light on the neural functioning of children with OSA.",

      "abstract": "Any long journey gives rise to travel fatigue, regardless of the number of time zones that are crossed.10-12 The main symptoms are a sense of disorientation and increases in weariness and the likelihood of suffering from a headache. These difficulties are due to spending time in a cramped environment with little opportunity for exercise, altered (and often unpalatable) food, and dehydration. Delays and detours during the journey, and possible difficulties after reaching one's final destination after the journey, are likely to exacerbate the problem, as is the dry and slightly hypoxic air in the cabin when the journey is by plane. It has been suggested that the risk of deep-vein thrombosis is also increased in these circumstances, although the extent to which dehydration, lack of activity, and hypoxia are individually or collectively responsible is unclear.13-22If the number of time zones that has been crossed is small (less than three), travel fatigue is the only problem, jet lag (see below) being absent. The symptomsare transitory and can quickly be remedied on arrival at the final destination. Important measures include rehydration (water and fruit juices, not tea or alcohol which promote urine loss), a rest or short nap, some light physical activity, and a shower. Some of these measures (brief bouts of exercise and drinking to minimize dehydration) can be practised also during the journey. Any nap that is taken on arrival should not be too long, so that a full sleep can be taken when it is night; such a nocturnal sleep can be taken as easily as in the departure zone, since night at the destination and place of departure coincide.",

Practical application of the epilepsy definition usually is taken to mean at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 h apart, but a 2014 practical definition refines the description. With this definition, epilepsy is a disease of the brain with either: (1) at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals past the applicable age of an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome or those who have remained seizure-free for the past 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the past 5 years.A consensus process has refined the definition of epilepsy.",

      "title": "(Mis)perception of sleep in insomnia: A puzzle and a resolution.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is prevalent, causing severe distress and impairment. This review focuses on illuminating the puzzling finding that many insomnia patients misperceive their sleep. They overestimate their sleep onset latency (SOL) and underestimate their total sleep time (TST), relative to objective measures. This tendency is ubiquitous (although not universal). Resolving this puzzle has clinical, theoretical, and public health importance. There are implications for assessment, definition, and treatment. Moreover, solving the puzzle creates an opportunity for real-world applications of theories from clinical, perceptual, and social psychology as well as neuroscience. Herein we evaluate 13 possible resolutions to the puzzle. Specifically, we consider the possible contribution, to misperception, of (1) features inherent to the context of sleep (e.g., darkness); (2) the definition of sleep onset, which may lack sensitivity for insomnia patients; (3) insomnia being an exaggerated sleep complaint; (4) psychological distress causing magnification; (5) a deficit in time estimation ability; (6) sleep being misperceived as wake; (7) worry and selective attention toward sleep-related threats; (8) a memory bias influenced by current symptoms and emotions, a confirmation bias/belief bias, or a recall bias linked to the intensity/recency of symptoms; (9) heightened physiological arousal; (10) elevated cortical arousal; (11) the presence of brief awakenings; (12) a fault in neuronal circuitry; and (13) there being 2 insomnia subtypes (one with and one without misperception). The best supported resolutions were misperception of sleep as wake, worry, and brief awakenings. A deficit in time estimation ability was not supported. We conclude by proposing several integrative solutions.",

OSA can contribute to atherosclerosis through direct and indirect mechanisms. Animal and clinical studies have shown a close relationship between OSA and atherosclerosis and its risk factors. However, current studies showed inconsistent results. In the future, further research both basic and clinical studies need to be fulfilled. Future studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms between OSA and atherosclerosis.",

Yet, nocturnal events may provide important clues to sleep and neurological function. The diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal events can be difficult because of the frequent overlap of clinical descriptions and lack of diurnal findings. Patients may not follow the ''classical'' patterns of parasomnia or epilepsy, and some patients may have parasomnias provoked by other sleep disturbances or seizures.

They are associated with adverse effects on cardiovascular health, such as coronary artery disease. Sleep disorders discussed in this review article include sleep-disordered breathing (obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea), insomnia and restless leg syndrome. Sleep disorders primarily have four acute adverse cardiovascular consequences. First, intermittent hypoxemia-reoxygenation in arterial blood along with PCO 2 fluctuation; second is excessive arousals; third, decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic tone; fourth being the large pressure swings in the intrathoracic cavity.

Pischacha grahonmada (PG) is one among those 18 types. No works are available on PG till date. The concept of PG and its clinical application is unclear due to the scarcity of published literature on this topic. The aim of the present study is to explore the condition of PG in terms of contemporary psychiatric literature. Ayurvedic literature pertaining to “Pishacha grahonmada” has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and their commentaries. Electronic databases have been searched to find out the relevant psychiatric and/or neuropsychiatric conditions which are similar to PG by using relevant keywords. PG is characterized by clinical features like Aswastha chittam (feeling uneasy), naikatra tishtantam (unable to sit at one place), paridhaavinam (wandering/pacing/running), dayita nritya geeta haasa ucchishta ratim (hypomania or mania like features), madya maamsa ratim (fond of eating meat, alcohol abuse), shunya nivaasa ratim (staying alone/social withdrawal), nirbhartsanaat (threatening others), deena shankita vadanam (depression with suspiciousness), nakhai aatma vapushi likhantam (self-injurious behavior with nails), nashta smriti (memory loss), baddhaabaddha bhaashinam (irrelevant speech), akasmaat rudantam (crying suddenly), dukhaani aavedayamaana (sharing his sorrows to everyone)/dukhaani avedayamaana (unable to feel pain), uddhvasta (nakedness), rooksha deha and swara (rough emaciated body and voice), durgandham/ashuchi (unhygienic), rathya chaila trina aabharanam (gross abnormal behavior), and bahvaashinam (hyperphagia). “Nashta smriti” is the unique symptom of PG and it denotes memory impairment commonly seen in conditions like dementia.

However other conditions have shown to have presence of sleep on REM episodes which include but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, sleep wake schedule disturbance, alcoholism, neurodegenerative disorders, depression and anxiety Report of Case Here we present a case of 30 year old female with history of asthma, patent foraman ovale, migraine headache, and anxiety who presented with daytime sleepiness, falling asleep while at work, occasional scheduled naps, non-restorative sleep, sleep paralysis, and hypnopompic hallucination. Pertinent physical exam included; mallampati score of 4/4, retrognathia, high arched hard palate, crowded posterior oropharynx. She had a score of 16 on Epworth sleepiness scale. Patient previously had multiple sleep latency test at outside facility which revealed 4/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency of 11.5 minutes. She however was diagnosed with narcolepsy and tried on modafinil which she failed to tolerate. She was tried on sertraline as well which was discontinued due to lack of benefit. She had repeat multiple sleep latency test work up which revealed 2/5 SOREM, with mean sleep onset latency was 13.1 minutes. Her overnight polysomnogram prior to repeat MSLT showed SOREM with sleep onset latency of 10 minutes. Actigraphy showed consistent sleep pattern overall with sufficient sleep time but was taking hydroxyzine and herbal medication. Patient did not meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder and sleep disordered breathing. Conclusion There is possibility her medication may have played pivotal role with her daytime symptoms. We also emphasize SOREMs can be present in other disorders such as anxiety in this case and not solely in narcolepsy",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep benefit (SB) In Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well characterized. To determine SB frequency, as well as to characterize and correlate it with other disease variables, we evaluated prospectively a consecutive series of 312 PD patients by means of a structured questionnaire: 55% reported having SB and 35% reported that awakening was their best time of the day. Because of SB, 21% of the entire population were able to skip or delay medication. The mean duration of the phenomenon was 85.4 ± 67 min. Patients with SB were significantly older (p &lt; 0.0002), had disease longer (p &lt; 0.05), and were often men (X 2 = 3.5, df 1, p = 0.05). Patients with SB took sleep medication with similar frequency as those without SB. There were no differences in hours of sleep or sleep latency. Sleep problems such as nightmares or somnambulism, but not the number of sleep awakenings, were similar in both groups. In conclusion, SB is a frequent phenomenon, especially in men, elderly patients, and patients with longer disease duration. SB enables the morning L‐dopa dose to be postponed in ∼50% of patients.",

      "title": "Troubles du sommeil dans la maladie de Parkinson et les autres synucléinopathies",
      "abstract": "Notre premier objectif etait d'explorer des troubles du sommeil peu etudies chez des patients avec synucleinopathies (maladie de Parkinson (MP), demence en corps de Lewy (DCL), demence associee a la maladie de Parkinson (DMP) et atrophie multisystematisee (AMS)): l'insomnie d'une part et les comportements parasomniaques d'autre part. Parmi ces derniers, nous nous sommes surtout interesses aux comportements moteurs anormaux survenant lors du sommeil non-paradoxal (sommeil NREM) chez ces patients. Insomnie : Nos donnees ont montre que les symptomes d'insomnie sont plus frequents chez des patients avec une MP par rapport a des malades atteints d'autres pathologies chroniques. Les symptomes d'insomnie sont correles avec la duree de la MP, mais pas avec les symptomes et signes moteurs ou non-moteurs de la maladie (article 1). Comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils : Les patients avec MP, DCL/DMP et AMS rapportent souvent des comportements a expression motrice, simples et complexes, lies au sommeil, que nous proposons de regrouper sous le terme comportements parasomniaques ( parasomnia behaviors ). Dans tous ces episodes, les patients semblent se comporter comme s'ils etaient en train de vivre leurs reves ou une mise en scene onirique. A la video-polysomnographie, ces episodes surviennent soit dans une periode de sommeil paradoxal stable ou les mecanismes physiologiques d'abolition du tonus musculaire sont deficients, soit lors d'etats intermediaires de conscience entre le sommeil et un reveil qui se produit. Dans ce travail, nous decrivons systematiquement pour la premiere fois les aspects video-polysomnographiques des comportement parasomniaques NREM ( NREM Parasomnia Behaviors, NPBs dans une population selectionnee de patients avec une MP, DCL/DMP et AMS. Par une analyse quantitative du spectre des frequences EEG, nous avons montre que ces phenomenes sont probablement expliques par des mecanismes physiopathologiques differents par rapport aux troubles d'eveil (autrement dits parasomnies NREM) de l'enfance. Les NPBs sembleraient etre des phenomenes plutot rares, d'apparition tardive dans les synucleinopathies (article 3). Nous avons demontre que les comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils NREM etaient plus frequents chez les patients atteints de DCL/DMP que chez ceux atteints de la MP et nous faisons l'hypothese que leur presence soit un indicateur d'evolutivite vers un stade avance de la maladie plutot qu'un marqueur specifique de demence (article 2). D'un point de vue physiopathologique, les comportements observes lors des parasomnies du sommeil paradoxal et non-paradoxal pourraient etre vus comme des fenetres permissives pour l'exploration de l'activite mentale pendant le sommeil. Dans les NPBs cette fenetre serait representee par une defaillance des circuits de l'eveil ( arousal ), de l'attention et de la cognition lors des transitions du sommeil a la veille, tandis que dans le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal (TCSP), par une defaillance des circuits du controle de l'atonie musculaire. En synthese, les resultats de nos travaux suggerent que l'insomnie et les comportements parasomniaques pourraient representer l'expression clinique d'une alteration fonctionnelle des circuits regulateurs du sommeil et de la veille et du declin cognitif lie a la neurodegenerescence de la MP, la DCL/DMP et l'AMS, leur presence etant un indicateur d'un stade evolutif avance de la maladie. Le TCSP comme modele physiopathologique pour etudier l'akinesie et la bradykinesie : Notre deuxieme objectif a ete la mise en place d'un protocole visant a enregistrer de facon couplee a une videopolysomnographie, les potentiels de champ local des neurones des noyaux sous-thalamiques (NSTs) pendant le sommeil et la veille chez des patients avec un TCSP secondaire a une MP au moyen d'electrodes implantees dans le but d'une stimulation a haute frequence des NSTs. Cette etude est basee sur l'observation que, dans la MP, les mouvements produits en sommeil paradoxal ne sont akinetiques mais proches de la normale. A ce jour, 3 patients ont pu etre recrutes et participer a cette etude (etude Reves Park NST).",

It should be distinguished from movements during REM sleep, mainly REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). A 25-year-old male complained of daytime sleepiness with snoring and dream enactment behavior (DEB). Video polysomnography (PSG) excluded RBD and obstructive sleep apnea; frequent SRHJs during REM sleep with or without respiratory effort-related arousals, and SRHJs followed by one episode of DEB was observed. On PSG with continuous positive airway pressure titration, SRHJ with arousal events still remained but DEB symptom was resolved. REM without atonia unrelated to head jerks was not observed on all PSG data. Excessive SRHJs with arousal related to a sleep disturbance could indicate an SRHJ disorder, which might be a novel sleep-related movement disorder. In addition, clinicians should be careful in diagnosing young patients with RBD.",

      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in neurology",
      "abstract": "Sleep medicine is relevant in both neurology and general medicine. A disordered sleep–wake cycle can have major effects on many common neurological complaints such as headache and epilepsy, and it may also directly affect important general health issues, such as blood pressure. Furthermore, sleep related disorders such as parasomnias, particularly with agitation, can be hazardous to patients and bed partners while also being diagnostic clues in some neurodegenerative diseases. The traditional view that sleep is simply the absence of wakefulness has been increasingly refined over the past 50 years or so. Rather, it is a precisely orchestrated and complex state with distinct and mutually exclusive phases: non-rapid eye movement (stages 1–4) and rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM and REM sleep, respectively), defined largely by the surface EEG. In a typical night, there are 4–5 cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (figure 1). In REM sleep, the cortical EEG is highly activated in common with wakefulness, usually corresponding to the vivid dreaming that accompanies REM sleep. REM sleep periods predominate towards the end of the nocturnal sleep period whereas the deepest stages of non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) tend to occur within an hour of sleep onset. Figure 1 (A) EEG waveforms that define wake and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages. (B) An idealised hypnogram summarising the distribution of the sleep stages through a typical night. Black bars refer to REM sleep during which the EEG pattern returns to that seen in wakefulness. Given the normal variation in sleep patterns and habits between people, distinguishing whether or not a sleep related symptom suggests a formal disorder can be difficult. It is a salutary fact that normal ageing is associated with deteriorating and poorly consolidated nocturnal sleep.",

      "abstract": "Over a century of work has confirmed crucial links between sleep and epilepsy. Seizures and some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) adversely affect the continuity of sleep. However, sleep is fragmented in the absence of seizures or medication, suggesting that sleep instability may be an inherent component of certain forms of epilepsy. In turn, sleep instability can promote seizures, thus forming a vicious cycle. Sleep deprivation provokes seizures and epileptiform discharges in some people with epilepsy. Synchronized nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep facilitates seizures, whereas desynchronized rapid eye movement (REM) sleep discourages seizure occurrence. The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is useful in the diagnosis and localization of epilepsy, as new epileptic foci can appear in sleep and REM sleep may demonstrate the narrowest localization of the primary focus. Polysomnography (PSG) with expanded EEG aids in the differentiation of seizures and parasomnias and in the diagnosis of primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, that can exacerbate seizures. Treating sleep apnea may lead to improved seizure control. These observations underscore the importance of sleep in the diagnosis and treatment of people with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Nearly half of older adults complain of difficulty sleeping [1]. Although most of such complaints can be attributed to the changes in the sleep architecture as we grow old, primary sleep disorders are more prevalent in elderly [2]. Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

It is known that asthma symptoms tend to be more severe at night and that asthma-related deaths are most likely to occur during the night or early morning. Nocturnal symptoms occur in 60-74% of asthma patients and are markers of inadequate control of the disease. Various pathophysiological mechanisms are related to the worsening of asthma symptoms, OSAS being one of the most important factors. In patients with asthma, OSAS should be investigated whenever there is inadequate control of symptoms of nocturnal asthma despite the treatment recommended by guidelines having been administered. There is evidence in the literature that the use of continuous positive airway pressure contributes to asthma control in asthma patients with obstructive sleep apnea and uncontrolled asthma.",

Sleep disorders of the upper airway result from any condition or disease that causes its partial or complete obstruction when a patient assumes a supine position and goes to sleep. Sleep disorders, particularly untreated obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can be associated with motor vehicle accidents, poor work performance in the office or workplace, and also makes a person prone to occupational accidents and reduced quality of life. Comprehensive management of upper airway sleep disorders requires an interdisciplinary approach. A prosthodontist can play a significant role as the team member in the interdisciplinary approach for the management of upper airway sleep disorders.

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

In the non-lateralized cases, onset was bilateral. In the one intermittent case, while her tinnitus was absent her pulsatile tinnitus could be induced by somatic testing. No etiology was found from physical examination, imaging, or ancillary testing. Because these cases of pulsatile tinnitus can be both induced and suppressed by activation of the somatosensory system of the head or upper lateral neck, we propose that this syndrome is occurring from (a) cardiac synchronous somatosensory activation of the central auditory pathway or (b) failure of the somatosensory-auditory central nervous system interactions to suppress cardiac somatosounds.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinsonian patients often experience wake/sleep behavior disturbances, which can appear at an early stage of the disease in a way that is still not fully described. We aimed here at reproducing and characterizing these clinical signs in a progressive non-human primate model of the Parkinson’s disease to better understand the underlying physiopathology and to identify biomarkers of the disease. Three adult non-human primates ( macaca fascicularis ) were equipped with a polysomnographic telemetry system allowing the characterization of the wake/sleep behavior by long-term neurophysiological recordings and a modified multiple sleep latency test. Experiments were first performed in healthy animals and then during the progressive induction of a parkinsonian syndrome by chronic intramuscular injections of low doses of MPTP. We observed a significant early onset of wake/sleep behavior disturbances, before any motor symptoms, resulting in (i) a disorganization of nighttime sleep with more deep sleep and (ii) a disorganization of daytime naps with an excessive daytime sleepiness characterized by longer duration of naps, which occurred faster. These observations persisted and worsened in stable symptomatic state. In that latter state, we observed persistent excessive daytime sleepiness and more disorganized nighttime sleep architecture and continuity. Interpolating to the human condition, the present study suggests that nighttime and daytime sleep disorders may appear in early stage of the disease. They could thus be used as biomarkers of the disease for early stratification of patients who are at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή ασχολείται με το ερευνητικό αντικείμενο της αξιολόγησης της επίδρασης των οδοντιατρικών ενδοστοματικών συσκευών στην αντιμετώπιση ασθενών με σύνδρομο αποφρακτικής άπνοιας ύπνου (ΣΑΑΥ) και ροχαλητό. Το ΣΑΑΥ αποτελεί μια δυνητικά απειλητική για τη ζωή διαταραχή της αναπνοής στον ύπνο που χαρακτηρίζεται από επαναλαμβανόμενα επεισόδια πλήρους (άπνοια) ή μερικής (υπόπνοια) απόφραξης των ανώτερων αναπνευστικών αεραγωγών. Κύρια συμπτώματα των ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ αναφέρονται το έντονο ροχαλητό, τα επεισόδια της άπνοιας στον ύπνο, η ημερήσια υπνηλία και η διαταραχή της συγκέντρωσης, μνήμης και προσοχής. Στις σοβαρές αρνητικές επιπτώσεις του συνδρόμου περιλαμβάνονται η δυσρύθμιστη αρτηριακή υπέρταση, η ανεξήγητη πνευμονική καρδιά, η πρωινή καταβολή, το καταθλιπτικό συναίσθημα και ο αιφνίδιος θάνατος στον ύπνο. Η ευρέως διαδεδομένη συντηρητική αντιμετώπιση του ΣΑΑΥ με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)) θεωρείται μια ικανοποιητική θεραπευτική λύση στο πρόβλημα των ασθενών. Εντούτοις, η μη εύκολη αποδοχή της θεραπείας, αναφέρεται σε ποσοστό 46-83%, οδήγησε πολλούς ερευνητές στην εφαρμογή εναλλακτικών και εξίσου αποτελεσματικών μεθόδων αντιμετώπισης του ΣΑΑΥ όπως είναι οι οδοντιατρικές ενδοστοματικές συσκευές (ΕΣ).Σκοπός: Σκοπός της παρούσας μελέτης είναι α) η διερεύνηση της επίδρασης των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου στην αντιμετώπιση ασθενών με αποφρακτική άπνοια ύπνου και ροχαλητό και β) η διερεύνηση της επίδρασης των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου στο στοματογναθικό σύστημα (ΣΣ) και στη γενική υγεία των ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ.Υλικό και μέθοδοι: Στην παρούσα ερευνητική μελέτη συμμετείχαν συνολικά 59 ασθενείς, οι οποίοι προσήλθαν στο Κέντρο Μελέτης Διαταραχών Ύπνου, Α’ Κλινική Εντατικής Θεραπείας, Γ.Ν.Α «Ο Ευαγγελισμός», Ιατρική Σχολή ΕΚΠΑ, με σκοπό τη διάγνωση και θεραπευτική αντιμετώπιση των επεισοδίων του ροχαλητού και του συνδρόμου της αποφρακτικής άπνοιας στον ύπνο. Η μελέτη αποτελεί μέρος μιας ελεγχόμενης κλινικής δοκιμής με δύο παράλληλες ομάδες ασθενών. Τριάντα ασθενείς (ερευνητική ομάδα) αντιμετωπίστηκαν στην Κλινική Αντιμετώπισης Στοματοπροσωπικού Πόνου της Οδοντιατρικής Σχολής του ΕΚΠΑ με ενδοστοματική συσκευή προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου (ΕΣ) και είκοσι εννέα ασθενείς (ομάδα ελέγχου) αντιμετωπίστηκαν στο Κέντρο Μελέτης Διαταραχών Ύπνου του Γ.Ν.Α «Ο Ευαγγελισμός» με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)). Η διάγνωση του συνδρόμου της αποφρακτικής άπνοιας στον ύπνο και το ροχαλητό έγινε με βάση τα αποτελέσματα ολονύκτιας πολυυπνογραφίας (Polysomnography (PSG)). Ενδοσκόπηση του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού υπό φαρμακευτικό ύπνο (Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE)) πραγματοποιήθηκε πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας, στους ασθενείς της ερευνητικής ομάδας, για την καταγραφή του σημείου απόφραξης του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού και τον προσδιορισμό του βαθμού προώθησης που θα έχει η κάτω γνάθος με την ενδοστοματική συσκευή ώστε η θεραπεία να είναι αποτελεσματική. Στους ασθενείς της ομάδας ελέγχου, πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας, πραγματοποιήθηκε χειροκίνητη τιτλοποίηση (titration) της θετικής πίεσης αέρα της συσκευής CPAP υπό πλήρη παρακολούθηση με πολυυπνογραφία (PSG). Η επιλεγμένη πίεση αέρα της συσκευής CPAP κατά την τιτλοποίηση, καταγράφηκε ως άριστη πίεση που έλυνε το πρόβλημα της απόφραξης του αναπνευστικού αεραγωγού κατά τον ύπνο και αυτή προτάθηκε για τη θεραπεία κατ’ οίκον. Έγινε σύγκριση και στατιστική ανάλυση των αποτελεσμάτων α) της πολυυπνογραφίας (Polysomnography (PSG)), β) του κλινικού δείκτη δυσλειτουργίας του στοματογναθικού συστήματος κατά Helkimo (Di), γ) της ημερήσιας υπνηλίας (κλίμακα υπνηλίας κατά Epworth και δ) της σχετιζόμενης με την υγεία ποιότητας ζωής (Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)) πριν την έναρξη της θεραπείας και οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη θεραπευτική παρέμβαση.Αποτελέσματα: Η διακύμανση του δείκτη άπνοιας-υπόπνοιας ύπνου (Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)) των 59 σθενών της μελέτης παρουσίασε σημαντική μεταβολή οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη χορήγηση της θεραπείας καθώς παρατηρήθηκε σημαντική μείωση της μέσης τιμής του δείκτη AHI από 35.14 επεισόδια/h σε 6.82/h στους ασθενείς που ακολούθησαν θεραπεία με ενδοστοματική συσκευή προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου και από 35.22/h σε 3.01/h στους ασθενείς που ακολούθησαν θεραπεία με συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών (p&lt;0.001). Δεν παρατηρήθηκε στατιστικά σημαντική διαφορά μεταξύ της ερευνητικής ομάδας και της ομάδας ελέγχου όσον αφορά τη μέση τιμή του μέσου κορεσμού του αρτηριακού αίματος σε οξυγόνο (SpO2) (p=0.571), τη μέση τιμή της κλίμακας υπνηλίας κατά Epworth (p&lt;0.422) και τη μέση τιμή της σχετιζόμενης με την υγεία ποιότητας ζωής (p&lt;0.197) οκτώ εβδομάδες μετά τη χορήγηση της θεραπείας. Δεν παρατηρήθηκαν σημαντικές μεταβολές στην κατάσταση της υγείας του στοματογναθικού συστήματος των ασθενών της μελέτης με βάση τα αποτελέσματα του κλινικού δείκτη δυσλειτουργίας του ΣΣ κατά Helkimo (Di) (p=0.789).Συμπεράσματα: Βραχυπρόθεσμα, οι ενδοστοματικές συσκευές προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου αποτελούν μια εναλλακτική μέθοδο αντιμετώπισης των ασθενών με ήπια, μέτρια και σοβαρή αποφρακτική άπνοια ύπνου και ροχαλητό και μπορούν να θεωρηθούν εξίσου αποτελεσματικές με τη συσκευή συνεχούς θετικής πίεσης αεραγωγών. Η συσκευή CPAP φαίνεται να έχει καλύτερα αποτελέσματα στη μείωση του δείκτη άπνοιας-υπόπνοιας ύπνου όπως καταγράφεται στην πολυυπνογραφία. Ωστόσο, συγκρίσιμα αποτελέσματα βρέθηκαν μεταξύ των δύο θεραπευτικών μεθόδων όσον αφορά τη βελτίωση της κλινικής συμπτωματολογίας και τη σχετιζόμενη με την υγεία ποιότητα ζωής. Η χρήση των ενδοστοματικών συσκευών προώθησης της κάτω γνάθου για χρονικό διάστημα παρακολούθησης οκτώ εβδομάδων δεν φαίνεται να σχετίζεται με σημαντικές μεταβολές στη λειτουργία του στοματογναθικού συστήματος ασθενών με ΣΑΑΥ και ροχαλητό.",

La ansiedad es la segunda entidad con mayor frecuencia, quizás debido a la liberación de catecolaminas durante la noche. Existen otras sintomatologías asociadas a la apnea del sueño que deben ser revisadas y que mejorarían con un tratamiento adecuado, así como también mejoraría la calidad de vida de los pacientes, pues la atención, la concentración y la memoria incrementarían o disminuirían la irritabilidad y otros síntomas.",

Three patients developed RBD after acute inflammatory encephalitis, which lasted for 3 months to 1 year. They talked, moved and walked nightly while asleep. During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep. The RBD improved with clonazepam and there was no recurrence at 1 year follow-up. The global encephalitis could be responsible for the RBD and destruction of sleep architecture.

      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

Although complicated, the relationship between sleep and epilepsy is becoming clearer. Sleep, and particularly deep non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, increase interictal epileptiform activity. Sleep increases certain seizure types and the rate of generalization of partial seizures, however rapid-eye-movement sleep seems to suppress seizures. Sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea, exacerbate seizures. Seizures, in turn, can disrupt sleep structure, particularly rapid-eye-movement sleep. An understanding of these relationships is important in seizure control and in maximizing the quality of life for patients with epilepsy.",

Polydipsia has been associated with catatonia without clear causation or directionality. We describe two cases where polydipsia was a sign of catatonia in the form of stereotypy, represented by abnormally frequent motor behavior. A 56-year-old male with a history of bipolar I disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder presented with paranoid delusions, agitation, poor sleep, self-inflicted injury, and hyponatremia related to polydipsia. Symptoms, including polydipsia, rapidly improved with lorazepam. Due to medication nonadherence, two other similar hospitalizations occurred over the next month, each presenting with polydipsia-related hyponatremia as well as other catatonia symptoms. In each of the three episodes of concurrent catatonia and polydipsia, lorazepam as part of the treatment regimen quickly resolved both the psychiatric and metabolic symptoms. A 76-year-old female with a history of bipolar I disorder presented with intrusive speech, impulsive behavior, and decreased sleep, alongside hyponatremia related to polydipsia. She also displayed several catatonic symptoms and was treated with lorazepam and paliperidone. Increasing paliperidone dose worsened the catatonia, polydipsia, and hyponatremia while increasing lorazepam resulted in improvement in these symptoms. Our patients presented with episodic polydipsia and hyponatremia concurrent with catatonia symptoms. Polydipsia in both cases is a repetitive motor behavior, likely representing a catatonic stereotypy. Our cases illustrate psychogenic polydipsia can sometimes be framed as a catatonic stereotypy, and therefore lorazepam emerges as an option for treatment.",

      "abstract": "Summary A 75‐year‐old man complained of excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ), difficulty falling asleep and nocturnal agitation during sleep. Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) was diagnosed and treated. Because of persistent EDS , snoring and nycturia, a nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG ) was performed. PSG showed high sleep fragmentation related to a moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment ( CPAP ) was proposed. Because of the persistence of abnormal nocturnal behaviours, characterized by screaming, punching and falling out of bed, a video‐ PSG with CPAP treatment was performed. The recording showed typical chin electromyography ( EMG ) activity increase associated with violent movements during rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep, suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorders ( RBD ). Clinical neurological examination found no parkinsonian syndrome, no dysautonomic sign and no neurological focal sign. Dopamine transporter imaging [123I‐ FP ‐ CIT single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT )] did not find any presynaptic dopaminergic pathways degeneration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a vascular lesion suggestive of cavernoma located in the pons. The present case illustrates the complexity of sleep disturbance diagnosis with a possible entanglement of aetiologies responsible for nocturnal agitation, and confirms that an isolated pons cavernoma should be considered among the rare causes of RBD .",

Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

      "title": "Associations of sleep disturbance with ADHD: implications for treatment",
      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. The relationships of ADHD with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.",

      "title": "Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea: More than an association!",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related breathing disorders are a spectrum of condition among them obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most severe and complex chronic clinical syndrome. This is characterized by repeated episode of upper airway occlusion, resulting in brief period of breathing cessation (apnea) or a significant reduction in airflow (hypopnea) during sleep. Person with OSA may experience loud snoring, oxygen desaturation, frequent arousal, and disruption of sleep. Disturb sleep also results in hypersomnolence, impaired concentration during daytime, and poor quality of life. OSA largely remains under-recognized and underdiagnosed entity. The global prevalence of OSA varies from 0.3% to 5.1% in general population.[1] In India, OSA varied from 4.4% to 13.7% (4.4%–19.7% in males and 2.5%–7.4% in females) in different studies.[2] Prevalence of OSA increases with age particularly in adults >60 years. The increasing rate of obesity also contributes to rise in OSA. Other contributing factors include male sex, anatomical factors, genetic and metabolic disorders, smoking, and postmenopausal female etc.[3] Recent studies have shown that there is a link between bronchial asthma and OSA and there is a bidirectional relationship where each disorder adversely influences the other one.[4] Patients of asthma appear to have an increased risk for OSA than general population. The first study that examines asthma and OSA was a case report by Hudgel and Shucard in 1979.[5] Since then, several studies have shown an increased prevalence of sleep disturbances among asthmatic patients.[67] Epidemiological studies demonstrate that asthma patients more frequently report snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and apnea. A recent population-based prospective epidemiological study showed that asthma is associated with an increased risk of new-onset OSA.[8] In this landmark study, the incidence of OSA over 4 years in patients with self-reported asthma was 27%, compared with 16% without asthma. The relative risk adjusted for risk factors such as body mass index, age, and gender was 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 15%–19%). Despite this well-described association between asthma and OSA, the mechanisms that link the duo still remain hypothetical. Some of the putative pathways that link OSA with asthma include increased parasympathetic tone during apnea, hypoxemia-related reflex bronchoconstriction, irritation of upper airway neural receptors, altered nocturnal neurohormonal secretion, increased inflammatory mediators (both local and systemic), gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity.[9] Corticosteroids may be a potential contributory factor through effect on upper airway caliber (increased adiposity) or dilator muscle function (steroid myopathy) as identified in a study on dose-dependent relationship with inhaled corticosteroids and risk of OSA.[10] Further, it is to be noted that OSA and asthma are often complicated by shared comorbidities and potential for multidirectional casual pathways, i.e., obstruction, inflammation, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and rhinitis. The coexistence and hypothetical link between cough/asthma, obesity/OSA, rhinosinusitis, and esophageal reflux has also been coined as \"CORE syndrome\" to be specially considered among asthma patients refractory to the therapy.[11] On the other hand, OSA may adversely affect asthma-related outcomes. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that OSA is associated with the poor asthma control, more nocturnal symptoms, and frequent exacerbations in asthma patients.[4] OSA has been found to be associated with specific changes in airway inflammation that is predominantly neutrophilic with high levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, interleukin-8, and low reticular basement membrane thickness in patients with severe asthma, suggesting changes in airway remodeling.[12] Interestingly, patients who are diagnosed with OSA and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seem to have better asthma control in terms of improved asthma symptoms as well as better morning peak expiratory flow rates and quality of life. It seems that CPAP has beneficial effects on mechanical and neuromechanical properties of lower airways apart from ameliorating gastroesophageal reflux and local as well as systemic inflammation. CPAP also restores sleep and further helps to control asthma.[13] It is, therefore, important to identify this dual, rather complex, association between asthma and OSA. There are more than enough evidences that OSA is not uncommon among asthma patients; however, it is poorly investigated. OSA is largely overlooked in patients having uncontrolled asthma. Patients with poor asthma control despite optimal recommended management need to be screened for possible OSA so as to reduce treatment cost, morbidity, and improved quality of life in such patients. Future research on this \"alternate overlap syndrome\" will further improve our understanding on this topic with some more useful insights for better management strategies.",

Recent studies have described several pathophysiologic mechanisms that are active in OSA and may participate in the development of cardiovascular disorders. Primarily, the repetitive respiratory events that occur in OSA cause hypoxia, hypercapnea, arousals, or disrupted sleep singly or in combination. These abnormal physiologic events result in increased sympathetic outflow, alterations in blood pressure control mechanisms, dysfunctional ventilatory regulation, and vascular alterations. As a consequence of the relative impact and the genetic predisposition, these pathophysiologic alterations may lead to or complicate a wide variety of cardiovascular disorders. Frequently, patients who have OSA present with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, chronic fatigue, snoring, morning headache, and nocturnal arousals. Difficult-to-control hypertension, recurrent exacerbations of congestive heart failure, and nocturnal angina are common cardiovascular manifestations of undiagnosed OSA. This article reviews the major cardiovascular disorders associated with OSA and the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with their development.",

      "title": "Snore sound analysis for automatic Obstructive Sleep Apnoea screening",
      "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) is a widespread serious disease in which upper airways (UA) are collapsed during sleep. In the USA, an estimated 9% of women and 24% of men were found to have at least mild OSA. Loud/disruptive snoring, gasping/choking are the classical nocturnal symptoms of OSA. Polysomnography (PSG) is the current reference standard for OSA diagnosis, requires overnight hospital stay while physically connected to more than 15 channels of measurements. The recorded physiological signals are manually analysed to derive an OSA severity measure known as Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI). PSG is expensive, inconvenient and requires the extensive involvement of a sleep technologist. As such, it is not suitable for community screening. Furthermore, at present, more than 80% of OSA suffers remain undiagnosed. Recently, several alternatives to in-facility PSG targeting OSA diagnosis have been suggested to resolve this need. All these methods had at least one sensor requiring physical contact with the patient. Furthermore, the involvement of a sleep technician still needed to guarantee an acceptable level of diagnostic performance in home monitoring or community screening. Low cost, simple, unattended, convenient OSA screening technique is urgently required. With the onset of sleep, the upper airway (UA) encounters a number of physiological changes. The UA constrictions and impaired muscle tone evoke soft tissues to vibrate causing snoring. OSA has marked male predominance and also reported that gender increases the risk of OSA by a factor of 2-3. It is also well known that structural and functional properties of the UA are gender dependent. OSA, by definition, is closely associated with the UA patency in sleep. There exist gender-specific differences in vocal tract dimensions, elastic properties of tissues and prephonatory glottal shape. Considering the snore sound (SS) generation mechanism, it is highly likely that SS may capture these time, gender attributed UA properties and those could be embedded in the acoustic properties of SS. The goal of this thesis is to develop a novel multi snore-feature class OSA screening tool by integrating snore features that capture functional, structural, spatio-temporal dependencies of SS. We also work under the hypothesis that gender specific analysis of snore sounds should lead to a higher OSA detection performance. A clinical database was developed that contains the overnight snoring related sounds (SRS) simultaneously recorded during a hospital PSG. SRS were segmented and voiced snoring segments (VSS) were identified using a pattern recognition based algorithm. We also adopted a simple time domain based criterion to remove specific class of unwanted background sounds from analysis. Number of snore feature time series (pitch, recurrence, formant, non - gaussianity, mel cepstrum coefficients and higher order statistics feature classes) were developed by computing features from VSS. Set of feature vectors containing statistical features of snore time series were derived for each feature class. Logistic regression (LR) modelling techniques were used to optimize the feature vectors for OSA diagnostic performance in individual as well as in integrated feature classes separately. LR models were developed and computed the OSA diagnostic sensitivity/specificity using mutually exclusive testing data sets. We also augmented neck circumference to snore features which is readily available at no extra costs. The performance of the method was compared against the reference standard, PSG at two AHI decision thresholds (15 and 30) and cross validated. Our proposed techniques resulted in a mean sensitivity (specificity) of 93% (92%) for females and a mean sensitivity (specificity) of 92% (93% ) for males at AHI decision threshold = 15. At AHI decision threshold = 30, our method resulted a mean sensitivity (specificity) of 94% (93%) and 92% (93%) for females and males respectively. Our results indicate that gender based analysis of snore sound improves OSA detection. It also illustrates that this method has the potential to develop an automatic, non-contact, unattended population screening OSA tool.",

      "title": "Childhood snoring cannot be ignored as it has detrimental effects on neurobehavior",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (SDB) forms a spectrum of severity of disease from simple or primary snoring at the mild end to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at the severe end. In contrast to OSA, primary snoring is not associated with any gas exchange abnormalities or sleep disruption. In children, obstructive respiratory events are rare and primary snoring is defined as < 1 event/hr of total sleep time, with mild OSA defined as between 1 and 5 events/hr, a frequency much lower than used in adults. SBD is extremely common in children; however, the majority of children have mild disease, with over a third of pre-school children being reported to snore by their parents [1] and over 15% of elementary school aged children having primary snoring confirmed by the gold standard of polysomnography [2]. Parents and clinicians are usually only concerned about moderate to severe OSA (> 5 events/hr), and primary snoring and mild OSA have been considered benign, and something that does not need to be treated. Sleep disruption and/or hypoxia/hypercapnea and/or swings in intrathoracic pressure are the features of OSA thought to underpin the adverse effects associated with this condition. However, all severities of childhood SDB, including primary snoring, have been shown to have detrimental effects on daytime behavior, learning, and quality of life [3–5], with the majority of previous studies not finding a good correlation between SDB severity assessed by polysomnography and outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Sleep problems are prevalent in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and include psychophysiological insomnia, and sleep disturbances caused predominantly by circadian dysregulation. Studies using motion sensing wearables (including actigraphy) have shown a diverse range of rest activity patterns, including mis-timed sleep, irregular sleep, or non-24hr (free-running) sleep patterns. Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances impact negatively on functioning and quality of life, and long term poor sleep is linked to weight gain, and other serious physical health conditions. Many of the factors supposed to cause or maintain poor sleep in this group are modifiable through behavioural and environmental alterations. Methods An expert consensus study (Delphi study) was conducted to examine and explore the views of relevant experts, regarding the appropriate contents and format of an occupational therapy intervention to improve sleep in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Experts were recruited with expertise in: occupational therapy, sleep, insomnia, circadian rhythm, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Experts with clinical and/or research expertise were sought, as well as service users and carers. We conducted three rounds of online surveys, individual interviews, and a day of content presentation, comments and voting, and discussion groups with service users and carers. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and presented graphically for comparisons. Qualitative data (survey comments and interviews) was analysed using thematic analysis. Analysis and data collection was iterative; with later rounds exploring views raised during earlier rounds. The results informed the development of the intervention now being tested in a single group feasibility study recruiting twenty participants. Using mixed methods, this study will evaluate acceptability, homework adherence and trial related procedures, informing adjustments prior to larger scale testing. Results The Delphi study recruited and retained participants well (n=82 of target=85, 66% uptake from professionals approached, 97% completion), suggesting a high level of interest in this topic. Participants reached consensus regarding relevant content within the initial assessment, increasing daytime natural light exposure (when possible), approaches to evening routine, and the approach to activity and occupation. Views varied regarding the relative importance of sleep restriction and building ‘sleep drive’, versus reducing arousal such as through relaxation, mindfulness, or cognitive approaches to anxiety. Often service users’ and carers’ views reflected those of professionals, however on some areas views between these groups differed, such as acceptable levels of intervention burden, and regarding wearables. Overall views highlighted the importance of a tailored intervention, with adjustable and selectable elements. The tailoring of recommendations will be achieved through a thorough assessment, including longitudinal use of light and movement sensing wearables, and a detailed initial interview. Many intervention components are optional based on needs, and the homework recommendations from ‘core’ intervention elements will vary depending upon individual needs, preferences, and baseline problems and situation. Discussion The diversity of sleep disturbance presentations within this group poses a unique challenge when developing a brief first-line intervention. Individually tailored recommendations can be derived through the combination of wearable technology and self-report, and a growing body of work informing models of sleep disturbance in this group.",

Sleep self-reports in AN suggest that these patients report poor sleep quality and reduced total sleep time. Weight loss, starvation and malnutrition can all affect sleep. Patients with eating disorders who have sleep disturbances have more severe symptomatology. Objectives The authors intend to review sleep disturbances observed in AN, describe possible pathophysiological mechanisms and evaluate the clinical impact of sleep disturbances on the treatment and prognosis of the disease. Methods In this study, a non-systematic search of published literature from January 1970 and August 2015 was carried out, through PubMed, using the following keywords: ‘sleep’, ‘anorexia nervosa’ and ‘insomnia’. Results These patients subjectively report having poor sleep quality, with difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, early morning waking or reduced total sleep time. Sleep disturbances found in AN using polysomnography are: reduction in total sleep time, decrease in slow wave sleep, slow wave activity and reduced sleep efficiency. Conclusions Privation of adequate and restful sleep has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, may contribute to the appearance of comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety, and to a poor prognosis for AN.

La EN es mas frecuente en varones y suele tratarse de una EN primaria y monosintomatica. La EN primaria es aquella en la que no se ha logrado continencia minima de seis meses de forma previa. La EN monosintomatica no se asocia a sintomas nefrourologicos diurnos. La EN suele relacionarse con comorbilidades como el estrenimiento, trastornos del sueno o el TDAH. La predisposicion genetica, los antecedentes personales nefrourologicos y los trastornos psicosociales son algunos de los factores de riesgo en la EN del nino. El diagnostico es clinico y se basa en una historia clinica detallada, exploracion fisica completa y diarios miccionales y de ingesta. El diagnostico diferencial es muy amplio, englobando otras patologias como diabetes mellitus, infeccion de orina, enfermedades nefrourologicas, oxiuros y alteraciones neurologicas. Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

Muedigkeit ist eine subjektive Befindlichkeit. Von ihr ist die Leistungsfaehigkeit betroffen. Ursache der Muedigkeit ist Beanspruchung. Beim Autofahren entsteht psychische Muedigkeit aufgrund kognitiver Prozesse. Einen Unfall als Muedigkeitsunfall klassifizieren zu koennen, ist nur moeglich, wenn der Fahrer zugibt, dass er eingeschlafen ist, und wenn die Rekonstruktion der vorangegangenen Fahrt keine andere Ursache plausibel erscheinen laesst, etwa bei einer hohen Lenkzeitueberschreitung eines Lkw-Fahrers. Eine woechentliche Arbeitszeit ueber 60 Stunden, das Vorliegen einer Schlafstoerung, eine schlechte Schlafqualitaet, ein hoher Anteil an Fahrten zwischen Mitternacht und 6 Uhr, weniger als 5 Stunden Nachtschlaf und Schichtarbeit/Nachtarbeit sind Risikofaktoren fuer Muedigkeitsunfaelle. Mit zunehmendem Alter wird das Fahren weniger sicher. Insbesondere im Hochbetagtenbereich spiegelt sich dies auch in der Unfallstatistik wider. Zumindest bis zum Alter von etwa 70 bis 75 Jahren scheinen altersbedingte Beeintraechtigungen noch erfolgreich durch eine angepasste Fahrweise kompensiert zu werden. Dies ist bei der Begutachtung der Fahreignung mit zu ueberpruefen. Es mangelt derzeit an individualisierten Schulungsprogrammen, mit denen gezielt alterskritische Fahraufgaben trainiert und kompensatorische Strategien vermittelt werden. Es fehlen auch Moeglichkeiten, die Fahrtauglichkeit billig, anonym und ohne Konsequenzen ueberpruefen lassen zu koennen. Ruecksichtsloses Fahren stellt genauso wie kooperatives Fahren ein Interaktionsverhalten im Strassenverkehr dar. Ruecksichtslose Fahrer versuchen, ihren eigenen Vorteil durchzusetzen und verstossen damit gegen Regeln, die ein bestimmtes Verhalten vorschreiben oder verbieten. Auf der Opferseite kommt es zu Behinderungen und Gefaehrdungen, die zu Angst und Aerger fuehren. Beim kooperativen Fahren verzichten Fahrer auf ihr eigenes Recht, um einem anderen Fahrer einen Vorteil zu gewaehren. Fuer ruecksichtsloses und kooperatives Verhalten werden unterschiedliche Faktoren und Ursachen benannt. Es wird nach soziodemographischen Merkmalen und Persoenlichkeitscharakteristika von auffaelligen Fahrern gesucht, andere Autoren machen allgemeine soziale und gesellschaftliche Einfluesse verantwortlich und wieder andere sehen ruecksichtloses Fahren als Folge der Kommunikationsbedingungen im Strassenverkehr. Sowohl ruecksichtslose als auch kooperative Interaktionsmuster sind fuer die beteiligten Fahrer und den Gesamtverkehr sicherheitsrelevant. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D369114. (KfV/K)",

Animal models have demonstrated abolition of rapid eye movement atonia, resulting in dream-enacting complex movements termed<i>oneiric behavior</i>, and patients with fatal familial insomnia may have vivid dreams that intrude on wakefulness. <h3>Objective</h3> To describe a new form of progressive dementia with hypersomnia and oneiric behavior. <h3>Methods</h3> Neuropsychological and polysomnographic studies of a middle-aged woman with a progressive dementia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a vertical gaze palsy. <h3>Results</h3> Neuropsychological testing revealed decreased verbal fluency, impaired attention and working memory, amnesia, poor recall, and bradyphrenia with hypersomnia. Polysomnography revealed a rapid eye movement behavioral disorder with complete absence of slow wave sleep. Prion protein analysis did not reveal the mutation associated with fatal familial insomnia, and other diagnostic test findings were unrevealing. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Our patient had a previously unreported syndrome of progressive dementia associated with rapid eye movement behavioral disorder and the absence of slow wave sleep.",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

RBD usually occurs in setting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and it may precede the development of Parkinsonism by many years. The disorders of arousal are the most frequent of the NREM sleep parasomnias. They may be triggered by prior sleep deprivation, alcohol, emotional stress and febrile illness. Different medications have been associated with RBD or REM sleep without atonia (RSWA), particularly psychotrophic and antihypertensive drugs. In the last two decades, some studies have demonstrated that arousals secondary to apneas, hypopneas and irregular breathing can be the trigger for sleepwalking and related disorders in children and adults. Hallucinations, both diurnal and nocturnal, have been described in PD associated with cognitive decline and RBD.",

A 55-year-old female patient who complained of chronic insomnia on the initial visit turned out to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome of a mild degree (respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 13.8/hour, %time spent below 90% of SaO2=5.0%) on nocturnal polysomnography. Interestingly, apnea episodes and desaturations mainly occurred during sleep stage. And RDI and destaturations during sleep stage were found to be severe enough to classify as a severe degree of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. These findings suggest that severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome might be masked under the symptom of chronic insomnia and that apneas can be predominantly localized within sleep epochs. In terms of treatment, REM sleep-dependent apneas may call for different methods of treatment, especially sleep-specific pharmacological intervention.",

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

Es handelt sich um eine Form der Kreislauffehlregulation, die sich durch Beschwerden wie Schwindel, Herzrasen, Benommensein, Kopfschmerzen und gegebenenfalls durch Synkopen zeigen kann. Diese häufigste Form der orthostatischen Intoleranz betrifft oft jüngere, sonst gesunde Patienten. Ein noch zu wenig beachtetes Symptom des POTS sind Schlafstörungen und Tagesmüdigkeit bei bis zu 40% der Patienten. Eigene polysomnografische Untersuchungen weisen auf vermehrte vegetative Arousals und nächtliche Tachykardien als Ursache einer Insomnie hin. Auch Tagesmüdigkeit und eine gestörte Schlafstruktur sind häufig. POTS-Patienten erscheinen dem Arzt häufig ängstlich. POTS-Patienten weisen jedoch in Angst-Fragebögen, die auf das Erfassen somatischer Symptome einer Angststörung verzichten, keine erhöhte Ängstlichkeit im Vergleich zur Bevölkerung auf. Das POTS stellt ein heterogenes, noch wenig charakterisiertes Syndrom der orthostatischen Intoleranz dar. Neuere Untersuchungen ergaben Hinweise auf eine neuropathische Form des POTS mit Denervierung sympathischer kardialer und sudomotorischer Nervenfasern. Die autonome Testung mit MIBG-Szintigrafie und Hautbiopsie kann hilfreich sein, um eine neuropathische Form des POTS abzugrenzen. Diese Übersicht stellt das klinische Bild, die Epidemiologie, mögliche Pathomechanismen sowie gegenwärtige Therapieoptionen und eine neue medikamentöse Therapie mit dem selektiven If-Kanalhemmer Ivabradin dar.",

OSA occurs when the upper airway collapses; in OSA, there is no airflow, often despite great respiratory effort. In CSA, the transitory cessations of breathing are because of a drop in respiratory capacity—there is no airflow and no respiratory effort. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a consequence of both OSA and CSA. A comprehensive history, ideally obtained from both the patient and bed partner, is the essential first step in diagnosing sleep apnea, but the gold standard for assessing sleep apnea is the polysomnogram. Sleep apnea has not been extensively evaluated in the setting of Parkinson's disease (PD), but recent studies have suggested that OSA may be more common in PD than in age- and sex-matched controls, and obesity may not be as important a risk factor for OSA in PD as it is in the general population.",

Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) resolved the CVHIs and normalized the EEG. An attempt at discontinuation of one AED resulted in a resurgence of the CVHIs and EEG abnormality. Les auteurs rapportent une observation dans laquelle, en l'absence d'antécédents épileptiques, est survenue une cris généralisée tonico‐clonique qui a été suivie par des hallucinations et illusions visuelles complexes multiples qui ont duré des se‐maines. 19 épisodes différents sont survenus. Les EEG ont révélé l' existence d' une activité rythmique temporale droite qui n'était présente que pendant les épisodes. Le traitement par médicaments antiepiléptiques a interrompu la survenue de ces épisodes et a normalisé l'EEG. Un essai d'arrêt de l' un des médicaments antiépileptiques a été suivi d'une récidive des episodes et des anomalies EEG. RESUMEN Un enfermo sin historia previa de ataques presentó ataques generalizados tónico‐clónicos seguidos de múltiples alucina‐ciones e ilusiones visuales complejas (CVHI) que persistieron durante semanas. El paciente describfa un total de 19 CVHI diferentes. Los EEGs mostraron una actividad rítmica temporal derecha sólamente durante las CVHI. El tratamiento con medicaciones anti‐epilepticas eliminó las CVHI y normalizeó el EEG. Un intento de interruptión de este tratamiento produjo la reaparición de las CVHI y de las anomalías en el EEG. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ein Patient ohne Anfallsvorgeschichte bot nach dem ersten generalisierten großen Anfall multiple komplexe visuelle Halluz‐inationen und Illusionen (CVHI) für einige Wochen. Der Patient berichtete über insgesamt 9 verschiedene CVHI. Im EEG zeigte sich rhythmische rechts‐temporale Aktivität, ausschleißlich beim Auftreten der CVHI. Behandlung mit Antiepileptika ließ die CVHI aufhören und normalisierte das EEG. Ein Versuch, die Antiepileptika abzusetzen, führte zum Wiederauftreten der CVHI und der EEG‐Veränderungen.",

The diagnosis \"Hyperventilation Syndrome\" (HVS) is made in the absence of somatic causes for hyperventilation, together with the presence of a characteristic set of complaints. In patients afflicted by this syndrome, the normal homeostatic mechanism for control of ventilation and of a normal PCO2 is disturbed or \"overruled\" by other respiratory drives. This disturbance of normal ventilatory control has various aspects, and possible neurophysiological substrates. Understanding these pathophysiological mechanisms facilitates establishing the diagnosis HVS. In normal resting situations the ventilatory rhythm is generated in the \"respiratory centres\" in the pons and medulla oblongata, and controlled by a chemical feedback loop for the PCO2-pH homeostatis of the organism. The activity of the medullary respiratory neuronal organisation can be stimulated from various other structures in the central nervous system (Fig. 1).",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder that is frequently referred to as one single disorder, but can and should be divided into at least four different subtypes, namely the atypical, melancholic, combined and unspecified subtypes, which have shown differential associations with cardio-vascular risk factors. A common symptom as mentioned in the DSM-5 is sleep disturbance, which varies according to the subtype, atypical being characterized by hypersomnia and melancholic by insomnia. Those parameters and others are observable by the use of polysomnography in particular. Multiple studies have analyzed sleep in MDD subjects compared to controls, but didn’t separate MDD into subtypes and only observed current MDD episode repercussions on sleep. To our knowledge, no study has yet assessed lifetime MDD effects on sleep, where sleep is measured around the time of remission of an episode. Therefore, our goal was to assess the associations for sleep characteristics measured just before, during or after the remission of a depressive disorder, either for MDD taken as a whole and for the depression subtypes separately. Using CoLaus/PsyCoLaus data from the general population of Lausanne, 1971 subjects were selected: 1123 controls and 848 lifetime MDD subjects subtyped into 126 atypical MDD, 229 melancholic MDD and 493 unspecified MDD (combined and unspecified taken together). Different sleep parameters were measured using polysomnography, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time in REM sleep and others. Results showed that, after adjustments for age, sex, socio-economic status, psychoactive substances, anxiety disorders and psychotropic medication, none of the sleep parameters were found to be statistically different between depressive subjects and controls. Possible reasons could be that the mix of current and past MDD subjects may have normalized the results. Indeed, our results suggest that when the MDD episode is over, sleep goes back to its normal structure, meaning that current MDD results were normalized by past MDD results. Further studies still need to be done where MDD should be subdivided according to time since remission to observe if there is an evolution in the sleep structure back to normal and if so how.",

      "abstract": "In this comment, we explored the link between sleep fragmentation and the cardiovascular risk, considering various sleep disorders and methodologies for assessing sleep fragmentation.It is generally known that sleep deprivation increases the cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic risk.Additionally, some data indicates that prolonged sleep is also associated with such risk. 1 In addition to sleep duration, sleep quality is also essential in the assessment of the CV risk.The continuity of sleep is one of its crucial features that contributes to effective rest and refreshment.Sleep may be interrupted by arousals and awakenings, which can result in prolonged wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO).Therefore, it is important to deter mine the threshold for the number of arousals and awakenings during sleep to consider them a normal phenomenon.According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) definition, an arousal is an abrupt shift in electro encephalography (EEG) frequencies, including alpha, theta and/or frequencies greater than 16 Hz (but not spindles), that lasts at least 3 s, with at least 10 s of stable sleep preceding the change. 2The scoring of arousals during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep requires a concurrent increase in the submental electro myography (EMG) lasting at least 1 s. 2 Arousals, which can be accompanied by respiratory events, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) or sleep brux ism events, are usually followed by autonomic activation, resulting in increased heart rate and blood pressure.Nevertheless, they can also occur spontaneously or be elicited by pain, light, noise, or a change in temperature.The arousal index (ArI), counted as the number of arousals per sleep hour, is frequently considered to quantify sleep fragmentation. 3 Sleep fragmentation, character ized by repetitive interruptions of sleep, is one of the factors contributing to excessive daytime sleepiness.The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is generally considered an imperfect in dicator of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity.It is strongly believed that oxygen saturation parameters (i.e., the mean oxygen saturation, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the nadir oxygen saturation, and the percentage of sleep with oxygen saturation <90%) are more effective predictors of CV complications than the index of respiratory events. 4It is worth noting that",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Insomnia has a close health relationship with other psychological illnesses such as mental disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. This sleep disorder usually occurs when the body is unsatisfied with the duration or quality of sleep and has difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep patterns. Until now, this problem still occurs frequently, especially in teenagers who often do not have good sleep patterns. This can be caused by stress or mental disorders during the day or more often due to other medical or psychiatric disorders, such as depression. This research aims to determine the relationship between depression or anxiety disorders and sleep disorders (insomnia), as well as to find out whether there are other things related to depression that result in insomnia. The method used is a literature review. The criteria for articles used are those published in the last 10 years. Based on the research that has been collected, it has been found that there are factors that state that depression can affect sleep patterns. A study states that exercise can improve sleep quality and has many other health benefits as well.

Gangguan tidur ini biasanya terjadi saat tubuh tidak mendapatkan kepuasaan terhadap durasi atau kualitas tidur dan kesulitan dalam memulai ataupun mempertahankan pola tidur. Sampai saat ini masalah ini masih sering terjadi terutama terhadap anak remaja yang sering tidak memiliki pola tidur yang baik. Hal ini dapat disebabkan oleh tekanan atau gangguan pikiran pada siang hari atau yang lebih sering karena adanya gangguan medis atau kejiwaan lainnya, seperti gangguan depresi.

      "abstract": "CCHS, or Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome, is a disorder of the central nervous system where, most dramatically, the automatic control of breathing is absent or impaired. A CCHS child’s respiratory response to low blood oxygen saturation (hypoxia) or to CO2 retention (hypercapnia) is typically sluggish during awake hours and absent, to varying degrees, during sleep, serious illness, and/or stress. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome should be considered in children with episodic or sustained hypoventilation and hypoxemia in the first months of life without obvious cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. Most patients breathe normally while awake but hypoventilate during sleep. Ondine's or Undine's curse is a very rare medical condition characterized by respiratory arrest during sleep. This rare form of apnea may require a patient to be on a ventilator to ensure that the patient is able to breathe while sleeping. Many cases are congenital, with symptoms emerging shortly after birth, although the condition can also be acquired as a result of severe trauma to the brain, as seen in traumatic brain injuries, strokes, and some types of brain tumours. One problem with Ondine's curse is that it is so rare that a doctor may not recognize it immediately, which can result in delays in care. In the present article, we have concentrated on congenital central hypoventilation syndrome; its sign, symptoms, clinical indications, causes, pathophysiolgy, frequency, mortality, morbidity, diagnosis, prognosis, treatments, as well as consultations required. The aim of present article is to provide in depth knowledge about various clinical aspects of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome.",

In the authors' study of 218 patients with high ametropia a correlation was not always present between visual acuity and the age of the first spectacle correction or the degree of ametropia. In some patients even correction of ametropia as late as seven to ten years of age led to spontaneous functional improvement of single optotypes acuity. The treatment of choice is to give the full ametropic correction at an early age.",

      "abstract": "Different breathing pathologies (apneusis, gasping, Cheyne-Stokes breathing and Kussmaul breathing) were observed in anaesthetized rabbits and rats exposed to hypoxia at the altitude of 7500-8000 meters. Dominance of the high-voltage slow EKG activity (the delta-wave type) suggested deterioration of the brain functioning. Registration of impulse activities of the inspiration and expiration breathing neurons in medulla oblongata revealed a higher tolerance of the inspiration neurons to severe hypoxia which is attributed to the metabolic specifics and functional heterogeneity of these neurons. Character of the neuron impulsation is indicative of the reflectory effects of hemo- and mechanoreceptors, and the direct effects of different humoral substances resulting in impairment of the central control of pacemakers and breathing pathologies. It appears that various breathing pathologies in altitude chambers and mountains are triggered by the hypoxic factor. However, no dependence was established either between the initial breathing rhythm (before \"ascent\") and various types of breathing at the \"altitude\" or these types of breathing and magnitude of hypoxia.",

Actigraphy is cheap, less labor intensive for the sleep laboratory and gives no burden for the patient. Major features of sleep (time in bed, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and naps during the day) are easily quantified. If done over at least five days the results are in a reasonable way comparable to those of PSG. Obviously, actigraphy provides less details of sleep and the way it is disturbed. From the combination of PSG and one week actigraphy, one gets all details of sleep and wake and their fluctuations over time. As \"stand alone\" technique, actigraphy is indicated in young children, mentally handicapped patients and in the assessment of therapy for sleep disorders. In our opinion assessment of sleep disorders in children should include actigraphy over at least 5-7 24 hour days, if possible combined with one or two nights PSG. As there are no strict rules and normal values for MSLT in children, actigraphy is also helpful as tool for global assessment of hypersomnia in young patients.",

Addressing the patient's sleep symptoms may help improve symptoms of their other underlying primarily neurologic disorder.New diagnostic modalities at home such as home sleep apnea testing have improved access and diagnosis of sleep apnea. Consumer health tracking devices have also helped patients focus on their sleep duration and quality, prompting them to bring their concerns to their neurologist.Like many neurologic disorders, a detailed history and physical examination are critical in the evaluation of patients with sleepiness or sleeplessness. Patients who have neurologic disorders are more likely to have poor-quality sleep. Questions about the patient's sleep schedule or screening patients for common sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are useful to add to a typical neurologic evaluation to better recognize sleep disorders in this population. Polysomnography, home sleep apnea testing, multiple sleep latency tests, and actigraphy can be used with the available history and examination to determine the proper diagnosis and management plan for these patients.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of sleep disorders is approximately 50%, with an even higher occurrence in a psychiatric population. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by shifts in mood and activity. The BD syndrome also involves heterogeneous symptomatology, including cognitive dysfunctions and impairments of the autonomic nervous system. Sleep abnormalities are frequently associated with BD and are often a good predictor of a mood swing. Preservation of stable sleep-wake cycles is therefore a key to the maintenance of stability in BD, indicating the crucial role of circadian rhythms in this syndrome. The symptom most widespread in BD is insomnia, followed by excessive daytime sleepiness, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, poor sleep quality, sleep talking, sleep walking, and obstructive sleep apnea. Alterations in the structure or duration of sleep are reported in all phases of BD. Understanding the role of neuroglia in BD and in various aspects of sleep is in nascent state. Contributions of the different types of glial cells to BD and sleep abnormalities are discussed in this paper.",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

Although the treatment of these sleeping problems is based on ventilatory support and pharmacological agents (in the case of central sleep apnoea or hypoventilation), positive airway pressure systems or upper airway surgery/oral appliances (in the case of obstructive SDB), the treatment effects are not always clear. The treatment effects, in particular on metabolic disturbances, need more investigation, whereas some effects, for instance, on cardiovascular outcome parameters, already seem quite convincing.

Polysomnogram revealed severe OSA; initiation of CPAP and levothyroxine resulted in immediate improvement. The lack of a previous psychiatric history and acuteness of presentation was consistent with hypothyroid psychosis complicated by sleep deprivation cause by untreated OSA. Primary hypothyroidism is a common disorder often associated with depression. It is rarely associated with psychosis and was first described as \"myxoedematous madness\" in 1949. It has not been previously reported to cause psychosis when associated with obstructive sleep apnea. This case illustrates the need for examination of potential multiple organic causes in a patient who presents with psychosis in the critical care setting.",

The clinical spectrum of ROHHAD is broad, but sleep/wake disorders have received relatively little attention so far, although the central hypothalamic dysfunction would make the occurrence of sleep symptoms likely. In this case report, we expand the phenotype of ROHHAD with a number of striking sleep symptoms that together can be classified as a secondary form of narcolepsy. We present a 7-year-old girl with ROHHAD who displayed the classic features of narcolepsy with cataplexy: excessive daytime sleepiness with daytime naps, visual hallucinations, and partial cataplexy reflected in intermittent loss of facial muscle tone. Nocturnal polysomnography revealed sleep fragmentation and a sleep-onset REM period characteristic for narcolepsy. The diagnosis was confirmed by showing an absence of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We discuss potential pathophysiological implications as well as symptomatic treatment options.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Objective</h3> Recognised causes of transient amnesia include transient global amnesia, transient epileptic amnesia, psychogenic amnesia and posterior circulation TIAs. Here we describe a previously unrecognised cause in otherwise healthy individuals: transient amnesia induced by sleep deprivation. We report four cases and suggest an explanation in terms of Tononi9s Sleep Homeostasis Hypothesis. <h3>Method</h3> Four physicians reporting the phenomenon were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to describe the episode as they remember it now, explain how the event came to light, detail the background of fatigue and sleep deprivation and provide a history of any similar events, and of drug or alcohol use. <h3>Results</h3> Three participants described episodes of successful, complex patient care, undertaken at night, at times of sleep deprivation, which they documented in medical notes but for which they had no recollection on the following day. The fourth reported memory loss for a complex decision. No participant reported any other similar episodes, use of alcohol or other medications or other cause of memory loss. Thus despite responding appropriately in complex situations, with evidence of short-term recollection from the medical notes, these doctors failed to form new lasting memories in the context of marked sleep-deprivation. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Sleep deprivation can lead to a selective transient anterograde amnesia. This phenomenon may be explained by the SHY (Sleep Homeostasis Hypothesis) proposed by Tononi <i>et al</i>. This proposes that during sleep synaptic weights are renormalized with selective weakening of synapses that constitute “noise” and preservation of the synaptic weights corresponding to “signal”. This creates “space” in the brain to allow memorisation of new experiences during wakefulness. Exhaustionof synaptic plasticity by prolonged wakefulness might thus give rise to anterograde amnesia as exemplified by the cases we describe.",

OSAHS affects up to 4% of men and 2% of women in the USA, with obesity being a major determinant.We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for severe obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome? What are the effects of treatment for non-severe obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).We found 43 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

      "abstract": "Disturbances of the rhythm and depth of the respiratory movements during sleep are common phenomena among healthy individuals. These disturbances could manifest themselves as apnoea, hypopnoea or some pathological types of breathing not affecting human wellbeing and functioning. When the quantity of breathing disturbances exceeds the specified threshold the clinical syndromes of sleep disordered breathing appear, each of them having their own clinical features and ways of pathogenesis. 343 patients (162 males and 181 females) with different forms of neurological lesions which could affect respiratory regulation on cerebral, spinal, neural and muscular levels were studied. It was found that the most prominent sleep breathing disturbances develop with the damage on a central level of respiratory regulation. There was certain specificity in the occurrence of different types of disordered breathing depending on the level of impact.",

The patients were awakened during the second half of the night and remained awake until the following evening. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy was not interrupted. Partial sleep deprivation significantly reduced the depression symptoms (mean value, 30.1%). The interindividual variations were considerable; deterioration was rare, and in 75% of the cases improvement occurred. Execution is simple, less stressful for the patient than total sleep deprivation, and can be carried out at home. Partial sleep deprivation has no contraindications except in the case of severe physical illness. The duration of the therapeutic effect is varied; repetition is possible. We discuss chronobiological hypothesis to explain the effect of sleep deprivation.",

Three additional criteria from the following seven items should also be present: a chronological relationship of pruritus with one or several life events that could have psychological repercussions; variations in intensity associated with stress; nocturnal variations; predominance during rest or inaction; associated psychological disorders; pruritus that could be improved by psychotropic drugs; and pruritus that could be improved by psychotherapies.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias comprise the behavioral, experiential, and autonomic nervous system disorders surrounding rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and can cause injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

The relationships between sleep and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are complex and are routinely overlooked by practitioners. Motricity and somnolence, the most consistent complaints and objectively measured sleep problems in children with ADHD, may develop as a consequence of multidirectional and multifactorial pathways. Therefore, subjectively perceived or reported restless sleep should be evaluated with specific attention to restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder, and awakenings should be queried with regard to parasomnias, dyssomnias and sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep hygiene logs detailing sleep onset and offset quantitatively, as well as qualitatively, are required. More studies in children with ADHD are needed to reveal the 24-h phenotype, or its sleep comorbidities.",

While significantly differing from controls, patients presented similarly increased light sleep, decreased slow-wave sleep and lowered sleep efficiency.

Affective symptoms, fatigue and perceived sleep quality also correlated to PLM index. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sleep structure and efficiency were similarly impacted in isolated PLMD and in co-morbid RLS.

If these changes are combined with other factors (obesity, iron or magnesium deficiency, anxiety, etc.), the pregnant woman may develop sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, leg cramps, and insomnia. These disorders increase the risk of pregnancy complications, reduce the quality of a woman's life, and form the basis for somatic and mental disorders in the postpartum period. Therefore, the obstetrician has to be familiar with the phenomenology, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep disorders in pregnant women to treat them promptly or to refer a woman to a neurologist or psychiatrist. This review briefly describes the common sleep disorders occurring in pregnant women, especially the various types of insomnia. The main groups of sedative agents are characterized, of which only doxylamine is acceptable for use in routine practice because of its proven efficacy and safety during pregnancy.",

      "title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep–Wake Disorders I",
      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is debilitating and the most common circadian rhythm disorder. It is defined as having a sleep pattern delayed by at least 2–3 hours from conventional timing, with great difficulty sleeping at conventional sleep times despite the frequent desire to do so. It is assumed to be caused by a delay of the endogenous circadian rhythm. Although it has its own diagnostic criteria, it lies on a continuum spanning from intermediate to moderate and extreme evening chronotypes to DSWPD and to non-24-hour phase disorder. This continuum is mainly driven by endogenous circadian period length varying from just over 24 hours to an extreme of 25 hours. Behavioral, psychological, and societal variables also contribute to the difficulty adhering to conventional sleep times. The recent novel findings of many DSWPD patients who do not have a substantial circadian rhythm delay suggest the contribution of non-circadian factors to the intransigence of a late timed sleep period; there is considerable evidence of the association of mental and physical health risks with the apparent inability to synchronize with the earth’s 24-hour period of rotation. Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is defined as having a sleep pattern timed earlier than desired or conventional. Attempts to delay bedtime to a more conventional time are difficult and result in reduced total sleep time since wake times remain early. This condition is relatively rare, affecting 0.0%–0.33% of the population, and infrequently presents for treatment.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

      "title": "Timing patterns of cluster headaches and association with symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "abstract": "Cluster headaches (CH) frequently recur at the same point in the circadian cycle, often during sleep. They may, in some cases, represent a susceptible individual's response to hypoxemia or other physiological changes induced by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If and when this mechanism exists, timing of CH close to the onset of sleep-and therefore OSA-might be expected. We questioned 36 subjects with CH about the times at which their CH usually occurred and about several symptoms known to be predictive of OSA, including habitual snoring, loud snoring, observed apneas and excessive daytime sleepiness. We then used logistic regression to determine whether occurrence of CH in each of six time periods was associated with OSA symptoms. The 23 subjects (64%) who reported CH in the first half of a typical night's sleep also tended to report headaches during the midday/afternoon period. Symptoms of OSA, and in particular habitual snoring, were predictive of both first-half-of-the-night and midday/afternoon CH (p<.05). Thirty-one subjects (86%) reported that their CH were sleep-related, usually occurring during any part of the night or on awakening, but symptoms of OSA were not predictive of this timing pattern. In short, several OSA symptoms showed an association with CH occurrence in the first half of the night but not with sleep-related CH in general. These findings suggest that in some patients, physiological consequences of OSA may trigger CH during the first few hours of sleep and thereby influence the timing of subsequent daytime headaches.",

      "title": "Sleep-wake abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis",
      "abstract": "A considerable proportion of patients with cirrhosis exhibit insomnia, delayed sleep habits, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These have been variously attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and impaired hepatic melatonin metabolism, but the understanding of their pathophysiology remains limited and their treatment problematic. Sleep is regulated by the interaction of a homeostatic and a circadian process. The homeostatic process determines sleep propensity in relation to sleep-wake history, thus the need to sleep increases with the duration of the waking period. The circadian process, which is marked by the 24-hour rhythm of the hormone melatonin, is responsible for the alternation of high/low sleep propensity in relation to dark/light cues. Circadian sleep regulation has been studied in some depth in patients with cirrhosis, who show delays in the 24-hour melatonin rhythm, most likely in relation to reduced sensitivity to light cues. However, while melatonin abnormalities are associated with delayed sleep habits, they do not seem to offer a comprehensive explanation to the insomnia exhibited by these patients. Fewer data are available on homeostatic sleep control: it has been recently hypothesized that patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy might be unable, due to excessive daytime sleepiness, to accumulate the need/ability to produce restorative sleep. This review will describe in some detail the features of sleep-wake disturbances in patients with cirrhosis, their mutual relationships, and those, if any, with hepatic failure/hepatic encephalopathy. A separate section will cover the available information on their pathophysiology. Finally, etiological treatment will be briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Alternativpsychose und forcierte Normalisierung durch Antiepileptika unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der neuen Antiepileptika",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Bei der Alternativpsychose und der forcierten Normalisierung alternieren Perioden von epileptischen Anfällen bei normalem Verhalten mit Perioden von Anfallsfreiheit (oder wesentlicher Anfallsreduktion) mit gleichzeitigem Bestehen einer Psychose oder anderen psychischen Störungen. Anders als die klinisch definierte Alternativpsychose geht die forcierte Normalisierung vom EEG-Befund aus. In der klinischen Praxis und in der Literatur werden die beiden Begriffe meist synonym gebraucht und beschreiben auch die gleichen Krankheitsbilder. Dies erlaubte eine zusammenfassende Auswertung der Publikationen über Alternativpsychose und forcierte Normalisierung. Meist ist eine Alternativpsychose oder eine forcierte Normalisierung Folge der Anfallsunterdrückung durch Antiepileptika. In der Zeit der älteren Antiepileptika wurde eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung vor allem bei der Behandlung von Absencen mit Succinimiden beobachtet. In der Ära der neuen Antiepileptika, die mit der Einführung von Vigabatrin begann, waren vor allem Patienten mit relativ pharmakoresistenten fokalen Epilepsien betroffen. 1987 - vor 31 Jahren - wurde erstmals über eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose bei Epilepsie durch die Behandlung mit Vigabatrin berichtet. Sukzessive folgten bis heute bei den meisten neuen Antiepileptika Berichte über eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung. Eine umfassende Literatursuche ergab in diesem Zeitraum 66 Fälle mit detaillierten Angaben. Frauen waren mehr als doppelt so häufig betroffen wie Männer; der Grund ist nicht klar. In 4 retrospektiven Studien wurden weitere 176 alternative Ereignisse in pauschalerer Form mitgeteilt. Bei den wichtigeren neuen Antiepileptika scheint das Risiko einer Alternativpsychose oder einer forcierten Normalisierung bei Oxcarbazepin, Eslicarbazepin, Gabapentin und Pregabalin besonders gering zu sein.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia and sleep-disordered breathing: the missing link – author's response",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia pathophysiology is a labyrinth where our understanding has grown from counting tender points to an evolving concept of subgroups and a countless variety of dysfunctional biochemical and metabolic interactions [1].\r\n\r\nSleep disorders have been reported in fibromyalgia patients [2], including daytime somnolence and tiredness, and non-restorative and fragmented sleep with higher occurrence of arousals, often associated with breathing-related disturbances. Electroencephalogram findings exhibit alpha-delta sleep and a reduction of slow-wave sleep [2,3]. More sophisticated studies may identify upper airway resistance syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea-hypoapnea syndrome associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events [4].\r\n\r\nConflicting results have been reported on the prevalence of fibromyalgia observed in patients with sleep apnea; it was significantly increased versus a control group according to Germanowicz [4], but was not according to Plantamura and colleagues [3]. It is noteworthy that Moldofsky [5], 30 years ago, demonstrated the induction of a musculoskeletal pain syndrome by selective deep sleep deprivation. These findings allow a better understanding of the subtle mechanisms of fibromyalgia, including decreased levels of serotonin and tryptophan, increased tumor necrosing factor alpha and interleukin 6 [4] or reduced growth hormone secretion.\r\n\r\nRecently, Martinez and Cassol [2] defined sleep-disordered breathing as a missing link between fibromyalgia, metabolic syndrome and orthostatic intolerance. Rather than a missing link, it could be one of the many links – mainly biological but also biomechanical, such as myofascial trigger points – that probably complicate the diagnosis and management of functional diseases and chronic pain.\r\n\r\nThese fibrolinks were roughly summarized in complex figures presented at the Myopain 2007 congress in Washington DC, and have recently been published [7]. This labyrinth concerns: neurotransmitters or hormones; 'nociceptive' or 'antinociceptive' receptors [7]; inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance [7]; glucose metabolism and nitric oxide/endothelin imbalance as well as apoptotic pathways or reactive oxygen species; and genetic disorders or neuro-vegetative disturbances [2]. Whatsoever, the rediscovery of the sleep-disordered breathing link deserves further investigation, in order to avoid or limit the eternal return of anti-depressant and anticonvulsivant therapies, which are often deceiving and, with respect to some recent drugs, poorly tolerated by fibromyalgia patients.",

Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12.

This has potentially serious consequences for the individual, employers, and society as a whole. Apnea refers to short spells when breathing stops. In obstructive sleep apnea, the throat constricts during sleep, preventing breathing; the apnea episode often ends with a loud snore and/or gasp. Such an event is sufficient to open the throat muscles to allow breathing, and the patient usually falls asleep again so quickly that the event is not remembered. This cycle repeats itself throughout the night as the muscles relax and the throat blocks again, and the frequency of the episode is used to determine the severity of the syndrome.",

Obtaining thorough\nhistory and performing complete examination as well as electroencephalography (EEG) are very\nimportant in confirming the diagnosis and finding the cause.

In this study we performed short duration (up to 8 hours) sleep deprivation in 139 children with history of seizure but with normal or non specific awake EEG. We obtained 70% abnormality, 54% of which was of classic pattern of absence (3 Hz spike and slow wave). Most abnormal EEGs belonged to children in the age range of 5-10 yrs.

      "title": "Narcolepsy and psychosis: A systematic review",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder in which psychotic-like symptoms can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is comprised of a variety of mental, somatic, and behavioral symptoms that occur in parallel with specific phases of the menstrual cycle. It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

Patients with sleep apnea suffer from hypoxia during sleep, resulting in metabolic dysfunction of various organ specific symptoms. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome results in critical psychological symptoms, which include depression and suicidal tendencies. Sleep apnea syndrome carries significant morbidity and mortality that is frequently ignored by healthcare providers. A high percentage of sleep apnea patients suffer from genitourinary symptoms, such as frequency, nocturia, erectile dysfunction, enuresis, and overactive bladder. Current concepts of sleep apnea, as related to urological health issues, are discussed to facilitate treatment options of sleep apnea syndrome.

Here we report an atypical case of an adolescent with episodes of \"sleep-related vocalization\" occurring every night, especially during the first part of the night. The patient had moderate mental retardation and a dysfunctional dysphonia; she had no recollection of the episodes and complained exclusively of mild excessive daytime sleepiness. A video polysomnography recording documented two typical manifestations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, characterized by the persistence of slow waves and without any electroencephalographic or breathing abnormalities. The quantified analysis of the acoustic features while confirming the rhythmic and stable characteristic of the sound suggests the involvement of the vocal fold vibration on its production. We interpreted these episodes as an atypical form of NREM parasomnia. A possible influence of the otolaryngologic abnormality can be hypothesized.",

The mandibular jaw movement biosignal can be incorporated in the polysomnography, displayed on the screen as a function of time like any standard polysomnography signal (eg, airflow, oxygen saturation, respiratory inductance plethysmography bands) and interpreted in the context of the target period of breathing and its associated respiratory effort level. Overall, the mandibular jaw movement biosignal that depicts the muscular trigeminal respiratory drive is a highly effective tool for differentiating between central and obstructive sleep episodes including hypopneas and for providing clinicians with valuable insights into wake/sleep states, arousals, and sleep stages. These fundamental characteristics of the mandibular jaw movement biosignal contrast with photoplethysmography, airflow, or oxygen saturation signals that provide information more about the consequence of the disturbed breathing episode than about the event itself.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia, nightmares, or nocturnal panic attacks are prominent features of sleep disturbance that spans across many anxiery disorders. In a meta-analysis of 177 studies, Benca and colleagues (1992) reported that individuals with an anxiery disorder take longer ro get to sleep at the beginning of the night, experience more awakenings during rhe night, obtain less sleep overall, and exhibit poorer sleep efficienry, relative to nonpatients. More recently, a review of dre literature by Papadimitriou and Linkowski 2005) suggesrs rhat the major findings reported bv Benca et al. have held over the ensuing decade. \\,foreover, Papadimitriou and Linkowski (2005) tbund an especially strong association beween sleep disturbance and several anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiery disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Afthough -ort of the evidence to date is based on samples of aduhs in their rriddle years, there is also evidence ofan association )erween sleep disturbance and anxiety disorders in ;hildren and adolescence (Forbes et al., 2006), as well as among older adults (Spira, Friedman, Flint, & Sheikh,2005). The first aim of this chapter is to highlight the potential importance of sleep problems in individuals with anxiery disorders.

Our second aim is to review the evidence base for rrearing parienrs who sufFer from comorbid sleep disturbance and anxiery disorder. As will become evident throughout the chapter, there is a dearth of evidence that specifically delineates the relationship berween sleep disturbance and anxiery disorder and thus several ofour proposals are based on evidence from healthy nonpatients or patienrs with other clinical disorders. 'We raise this caveat at the outset as an importanr limitarion to rhe conclusions that we draw.

      "title": "0846 Opioid Use and Sleep Architecture in Fibromyalgia",
      "abstract": "Patients with Fibromyalgia (FM) are frequently prescribed opioids to treat chronic pain and sleep disturbances. However, opioid use is associated with self-reported/actigraphic sleep disruption, and research suggests opioid effects may depend on age, dosage, or pain intensity. Whether opioid use/dosage affect physiological sleep (polysomnography, PSG-assessed) in FM is unclear. The present study assessed associations between opioid use/dosage and physiological sleep in FM, and examined whether effects depended on age or pain intensity. Participants (N=193,Mage=51.7,SD=11.8) with FM and self-reported sleep disturbance underwent ambulatory PSG measuring sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), %stage-1 sleep, %stage-2 sleep, %stage-3/4 (slow wave sleep,SWS), %rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Participants completed 14 daily diaries recording evening pain intensity, and daily opioid/sleep medication use (Y/N). Medication names/dosage were recorded. Milligrams of opiates were converted to lowest recommended dosage (LRD). Multiple regressions determined whether opioid use or average LRD amongst opioid users independently predicted or interacted with age/pain intensity to predict sleep outcomes, controlling for use of sleep medication and AHI. Opioid use predicted greater SOL and %stage-2 sleep, and predicted lower %SWS. Amongst opioid users (n=65), LRD interacted with age to predict SOL (B=2.59,SE=1.00,p=.01), accounting for 9% SOL variance. Specifically, higher dosage predicted longer SOL for older adults, whereas there was no association for middle-aged/younger adults. LRD interacted with pain intensity to predict %SWS (B=.27,SE=.08,p=.002), accounting for 15% variance in %SWS. Specifically, higher dosage predicted reduced %SWS for individuals with lower pain, increased %SWS for individuals with higher pain, and did not predict %SWS for patients with average pain. Opioid use/dosage did not predict WASO, TST, %stage-1, or %REM. Results suggest opioid use in FM prompts changes in sleep architecture, specifically increasing amount of lighter sleep and reducing SWS. Opioid-related sleep disruption may be exacerbated at higher doses in older adults and in patients with low pain, whereas higher doses may promote deeper sleep in patients with high pain.

      "title": "0813 Post-Pinealectomy Insomnia and Melatonin Therapy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland that has an important role in sleep; immune, neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, and endocrinologic function; cardiac-autonomic regulation and even cancer risk. We present a case of insomnia, somnambulism, dream enactment, and periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) after a pinealectomy. Report of Cases: A 40-year-old woman with a history of a complete pinealectomy due to a pineal cyst presented to the sleep medicine clinic. Shortly after the pinealectomy, she developed sleep onset and maintenance insomnia. Two years later she developed somnambulism, and four years later she developed dream enactment and PLMS. She reported no prior treatments for her sleep issues, including no history of melatonin use. On average, her total sleep time (TST) was 2-8 hours/night with awakenings every 2 hours. Sleep latency was 10-45 minutes. Polysomnograghy demonstrated an apnea-hypopnea index of 0.6/hr, PLM index of 68.1/hr, normal REM atonia, and no complex behaviors. The patient started 1mg immediate release (IR) melatonin, which did not help her insomnia, but parasomnias resolved. She had improvement in her PLMS with iron supplementation and melatonin. The melatonin dose was increased to 3mg IR which helped increase her TST to 4-8 hours. She was switched to 3mg extended release (ER) melatonin, and then increased to 4mg ER. She obtained the most benefit for her insomnia with 1mg IR plus 4mg ER with sleep latency reduced to 5-10 minutes and TST improved up to 7.5 hours with rare awakenings. Conclusion Pinealectomy in humans is rarely reported. Most data about the consequences of pinealectomy and pathophysiology of melatonin come from animal research. Melatonin level after pinealectomy is often undetectable or severely diminished. Current limited literature on patients with pinealectomy consists of case reports about patients who experienced insomnia, non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder [SSM1] and mood disorders. Melatonin doses ranging from 0.5mg to 14mg IR and up to 5mg ER have been trialed with most patients having symptomatic improvement with doses above 3mg. We found that a combination of 1mg immediate and 4mg extended release melatonin was the most beneficial for our patient. Support (If Any)",

      "title": "Sleep: universal for all, problematic for some",
      "abstract": "Human sleep is a paradox that evades detailed understanding to a large extent. Despite the fact people sleep almost every night, and despite advances in the scientific understanding of sleep, most of us have no insight or even a basic understanding of what happens when we sleep. Poor sleep, or a perception of poor sleep, vexes many. Insomnia or sleep disturbance is a very common presentation in primary care, and the effect of insomnia may be trivialised, to some degree, in the primary care setting, contributing to a lack of support and a dearth of clear management guidelines.1 An understanding of sleep and sleep requirements across the human life cycle remains elusive. As the parents of a newborn child can often attest, babies usually need to sleep a lot, but it is relatively uncommon for the infant's sleep cycle to align with that of the parents. Conversely, older people often perceive that their sleep is poor, and up to 50% of older people complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep.2 Although normal aging processes can account for some of that insomnia, medical or psychiatric diseases, including chronic pain, dementia, depression, sleep-disordered breathing and more, can also have a profound impact. In this edition of the Journal we see discussion of this important clinical issue in detail. The reality is that there are a good many drugs in the pharmacopoeia that have sedating properties, and generally these agents, when given at an adequate dose, will cause an older person to fall asleep. It is another question altogether as to whether that person will remain asleep for the desired duration of rest, whether the sleep achieved will be of good quality and will fulfil the physiological purposes required, or whether the medications will continue to work if administered on a longer-term basis. Moreover, by the time a healthcare professional of any discipline has completed their basic training and enters the workforce, it is virtually impossible not to have been comprehensively appraised of the potential adverse consequences of the use of hypnosedatives in the context of advanced age. Equally, it is well-nigh inconceivable not to have been thoroughly exposed to the worthy concept of dealing with sleep disturbance (particularly among older people) by addressing underlying causes. On this basis, it is really not plausible to argue that ignorance of some of the issues involved on the part of doctors, pharmacists and nurses is driving the persistent use of these medicines among older people. Epidemiologists, academics and even social commentators with no qualifications at all are building reputations and social media profiles from being the dispensers of wisdom about the inadvisability of resorting to drugs to address insomnia among the elderly, and who could blame them? Prima facie, it would appear almost impossible to advocate otherwise. Of course, were the matter to be as simple as is presented by some, there would be no older people with insomnia: all the underlying causes would be adroitly addressed, and our older generations would have sound and satisfying sleep of adequate duration every night; but this is very clearly not the case. The reality is that many of the underlying causes of sleep disturbance for older people are refractory to intervention, severe, progressive and, in some cases, irreversible. In one's seventh, eighth and ninth decades of life, sleep may not come as easily as it does to one in the flush of youth, but if the underlying causes cannot be remediated, should this be the basis to suggest that these older people should be consigned to endure sleep disturbance for the rest of their relatively brief time on the planet? The possible downside of pharmacotherapy for sleep disturbances affecting older people is a concept not lost upon any discerning clinician. There has recently been a huge raft of attention focusing upon the prescribing rates of sedating medications in settings like aged and extended care facilities. For example, the RedUSe study, well-designed and conducted with rigour, conclusively demonstrated that the proportion of residents in aged care facilities prescribed antipsychotics and benzodiazepines can be reduced by the implementation of a multifaceted intervention.3 The nuances can be debated ad infinitum, but the fact remains that although the intervention reduced the prescribing of a potentially hazardous group of drugs, the long-term outcomes (both clinical and economic) associated with doing so were not assessed. Proponents will point to the prevention of possible harm associated with a higher rate of usage were the intervention not implemented, but of course, in the absence of measurement of long-term clinical outcomes, we cannot be sure. In the meantime, other parameters that escaped measurement included those related to quality of life, injuries that may arise because of agitated behaviour and consumer preference. There can be no denying that hypnosedatives and other psychotropic drugs have the potential to cause harm for older people but, like the case for other clinical situations, both sides of the equation warrant consideration. There are dozens of examples of widely used drugs with serious adverse effects that are more common among the elderly, but it is of interest that hypnosedatives have been singled out for special attention. Like the starting position established for the construct of the RedUSe study, the respected Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults4 make it very clear that the learned consensus panel assembled to determine the ratings considers that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics should be avoided for older people if possible. By contrast, the guidance provided in relation to anticoagulants is less strongly worded than for benzodiazepines – an interesting observation, given that on the basis of per capita usage rates, it could be argued that the former drugs create more iatrogenic harm for the elderly than the latter. To be clear, this point is not made here to argue that hypnosedatives or anticoagulants should be either used or avoided for older people: that is a matter for much wiser people than this commentator. However, it is reasonable to point out that there appears to be a kind of societal overlay applied in the consideration of medicines used for sleep. It is interesting to consider that the people who publish guidance and provide commentary about what is and is not appropriate in terms of the medicines prescribed to assist older people with sleep are almost always younger people, yet to experience the decline in sleep quality and duration that often accompanies older age, but as Joni Mitchell once sang, ‘you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone’. As is the case for all medicines, it is important that the use of hypnosedatives for older people is guided with a conservative hand intent on averting avoidable harm; but, at the same time, it is also important not to dismiss the importance of a good night's rest. An Irish proverb suggests that ‘a good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures in the doctor's book’. Perhaps that prescription may be written more often? The author declares that he has no conflicts of interest.",

      "title": "Sleep-disordered Breathing in Neuromuscular Disease",
      "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.",

They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood.

      "title": "Sleepwalking and night terrors related to febrile illness",
      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "title": "[Sleep disorders in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders in childhood are frequent and usually harmless. They rarely point to a serious disease. Difficulty in falling asleep and nightly awakenings are age-dependent and transitory. While the largely harmless somnambulism and pavor nocturnus occur in the deep sleep of the first third of the night, the anxiety dreams of REM sleep appear preferentially in the second half of the night. Other disorders such as nocturnal enuresis and talking in sleep may occur during the whole night. It is very important to inform the parents because this helps to counter fears and false expectations. Consistent sleep hygiene needs to be developed with avoidance of irregular sleep rhythm and an unrestful sleep environment. Sometimes it is necessary to learn new behaviour patterns with the child. Only exceptionally is drug therapy indicated. However, nocturnal breathing disorders and nocturnal epilepsy do have a pathological significance and need specific therapy. In order to clarify the reasons for sleep disorders, it is necessary to keep a sleep diary, to undertake specific examinations (e.g. psychological, pneumological, neurological, urological, otorhinolaryngological and possibly using diagnostic equipment such as video-polysomnography).",

      "abstract": "Sensory sleep starts are variants of the more common motor sleep starts (hypnic jerks).1 Though sensory sleep starts may lead to repeated awakenings resulting in sleep-onset insomnia, their course is usually benign and no cerebral lesion has yet been described as being pathogenetically involved. Here we report a case of acoustic sleep starts (“exploding head syndrome”) which contests this latter assertion because their onset coincided with the occurrence of a brainstem lesion.\n\n### Case report.\n\nA 64-year-old woman reported on problems initiating sleep related to the impression of a cracking sound of average loudness. Up to 15 times during the first hours after going to bed this sound occurred shortly after losing full consciousness, followed by an experience of jerking in all four limbs and a brief sensation of fear leading to full wakefulness.\n\nThe patient, who had been healthy until then, noticed her sleep problem for the first time 12 years ago, coinciding with the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids were instituted under which no further progression of sarcoidosis occurred, even when steroids were tapered. Over this period the patient’s sleep problem was waxing and waning in intensity. Treatment with doxepin, citalopram, trimipramine, and amitriptyline led to no improvement. Only bromazepam (6 mg/day, 8 weeks) instantly led to unhampered sleep.

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral insomnia of childhood is a common disorder that results in prolonged sleep onset, increased night wakings, and overall shorter total sleep time. One of the most common complaints of parents of infants and toddlers is that their child either has difficulty going to bed or wakes multiple times per night. These nightly struggles can leave parents tired, frustrated, and very stressed. Sleep-onset associations are certain conditions that are necessary for a child to fall asleep at bedtime and then return to sleep with each normal arousal during the night. Limit-setting sleep disorder presents as bedtime stalling or refusal to go to bed at an appropriate time. When limits are set, children typically fall asleep quickly and easily. Behavioral insomnia of childhood impacts not only the functioning and behavior of the child, but also the entire household. Sleep problems in children also negatively impact parents and caregivers.",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements.

Dies gilt insbesondere für Patienten mit idiopathisch generalisierten und parietookzipitalen Epilepsien. Die Häufigkeit des gemeinsamen Auftretens von Kopfschmerzen und Epilepsie überschreitet dabei die rechnerische Koinzidenz, sodass von einer Komorbidität beider Syndrome auszugehen ist.

Parietal- und Okzipitallappenepilepsie (POLE) geben Kopfschmerzen an. Diese treten v. a. nach dem Anfall (postiktal) auf und manifestieren sich am häufigsten als Migräne-ähnlicher Kopfschmerz oder Spannungskopfschmerz. Seltener kommt es zu Kopfschmerzen vor (periiktal), während (iktal) oder zwischen (interiktal) epileptischen Anfällen.

In the clinical\nsetting amblyopia is generally expressed as a loss of visual acuity, and it usually presents\nitself during the ophthalmological examination by the ophthalmologist or the orthoptist\n(Levi 2006). It is usually associated with the presence of amblyogenic factors such as\nstrabismus (ocular misalignment causing each eye to have a different image on the fovea),\na refractive error (one foveal image is more blurred than the other); or, in rare cases,\ndeprivation of a clear retinal image (physical obstruction, e.g. infantile cataract or ptosis)\n(Ciuffreda 1991; Von Noorden 1967, 1985; Von Noorden et al. 2002b).",

In this study, PD patients with sleep disturbances were found in 50.1% (348 of 694 patients) were included in the registry (it surveyed patients with PD, aged from 21 to 90 years with different stages of BP living in different cities and districts of the Rostov region), noted sleep disorders during the disease, as well as to verify the diagnosis of PD. In the future, EEG-somnography were selected 48 patients with BP stage 2 on the Hoehn-Yahr, aged 52 to 71 years, and 50 healthy volunteers aged 49 to 67 years. It is established that in patients with PD stage of sleep you go faster - less time awake, and time of stage 1 non-REM sleep and the stage of paradoxical sleep (PS) in comparison with healthy volunteers. Chronic dyssomnia may occur due to ingestion of antiparkinson medications. Sleep duration decreases, but the psychological need remains the same. Structural changes are observed in sleep are significantly reduced slow-wave stage of sleep, some to a lesser extent, REM-phase and total sleep time.",

However, these associations may be missed in children, because children often fail to report excessive daytime sleepiness, and attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common primary diagnoses in themselves. We report on a 17-year-old, slender, non-snoring male who presented to his pediatrician with a prolonged history of four complaints: inattention, fidgeting, frequent sinusitis, and somnolence. He was diagnosed with ADHD, while the somnolence, which often abated somewhat upon use of antibiotics for sinusitis, was attributed to the sinus infections. A later sleep study revealed OSA, and thorough additional testing proved that the original ADHD diagnosis was in error. All four conditions were allayed with proper use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.",

People suffering from impaired sleep are often unaware of the problem. Along with poor knowledge of sleep pathologies on the part of medical staff, this leads to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of sleep disorders. One of the symptoms indicating sleep abnormality is complaint of fatigue, which can represent: physical weakness, mental fatigue, or sleepiness. The latter type is associated with several sleep disorders, among which are: obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement in sleep, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. To provide accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, medical education programs should offer the students a deeper knowledge of sleep medicine.",

Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health.

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

Closer questioning revealed a history of low energy, sleeping excessively without refreshment, exertional dyspnoea, and poor growth.

Detailed enquiry revealed the “hallucinations” to be “whooshing” noises in her ears precipitated by standing. She was found to have a haemoglobin level of 55 g/l, attributed to a combination of poor diet and menorrhagia. Periodic, anaemic, cerebral hypoxia could be proposed to be the root of most, if not all, of the symptoms, illustrating the importance of marrying physical and psychological history taking with suitable investigations for an eminently treatable condition.",

      "title": "Apnea",
      "abstract": "Apnea, from the Greek “absence of breath,” refers clinically to the partial or complete cessation of respiratory flow. Three types of apnea differ in their underlying pathophysiology as well as in their clinical presentations. Central apnea is the absence of respiratory effort from failure of brainstem neurons to generate an excitatory impulse and subsequently stimulate respiratory muscles. Obstructive apnea results from partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway despite normal brainstem excitation. Mixed apnea is characterized by both central and obstructive components. Understanding the differences among central, obstructive, and mixed apnea is essential for selecting appropriate and effective treatment.Central apnea can affect term neonates and infants as a consequence of their relatively immature brainstem respiratory centers. Clinically, central apneic episodes are characterized by a lack of chest wall motion and the absence of air flow. Brief episodes of apnea, which are fairly common, simply reflect the immaturity of the neural regulatory system, but an episode lasting more than 20 seconds usually is considered pathologic and may be accompanied by cyanosis, hypotonia, bradycardia, or pallor.Preterm neonates can present with idiopathic apnea of prematurity or with apnea from a variety of serious underlying conditions. The apneic episodes may be central, obstructive, or mixed. Idiopathic apnea, which typically has an onset from the second to the seventh day after birth, results from an immature brainstem in association with an underdeveloped upper airway, giving it a mixed clinical picture. It is the most common type of apnea seen in preterm neonates, with the risk varying inversely to gestational age. Resolution usually occurs by 37 to 40 weeks postconceptional age, but rarely may persist up to 48 weeks.When not idiopathic, apnea in a preterm neonate can be the consequence of a multitude of disease processes, including sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizure, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypoglycemia. It is critical to differentiate between a stable preterm neonate who has self-limited idiopathic apnea and one whose apneic episodes signal a serious, potentially fatal illness. Markers that suggest high risk for underlying pathology include apnea on the first day after birth, apnea in infants older than 36 weeks of gestation, episodes associated with cyanosis, and severe episodes requiring intense resuscitation. Any of these factors is a signal for further evaluation and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.Obstructive apnea typically occurs in older children, although it can affect infants. The upper airway may be obstructed in the nose (polyps, hypertrophied adenoids), in the oropharynx (enlarged tonsils, macroglossia), or in the larynx (subglottic stenosis, laryngomalacia). Clinically, children may present with a broad spectrum of findings, including snoring, respiratory distress while sleeping, behavioral problems, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not a benign condition and, if severe, can lead to cor pulmonale and death.Because it can be so diverse in its presentation, OSA is not always easy to diagnose. Frequently, a child does not have obvious symptoms while awake or behaviors resulting from sleep disturbance may be attributed erroneously to another condition, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Failing to take a sleep history is one mistake; not giving serious credence to parental reports of snoring and restless sleep is another. Even when parents are questioned properly about their child’s sleep, they may not be aware of habitual snoring. Children may not snore as loudly as adults or the parents may be deeply asleep when their child’s snoring is most likely to occur (in the last third of the night, when the body’s tone is most relaxed during REM sleep).Overall, 2% to 3% of children have sleep disorders, but a thorough sleep history is particularly important in children at special risk: those who have trisomy 21, craniofacial anomalies (Crouzon or Apert syndromes), or neuromuscular disorders (myotonic dystrophy). The following mnemonic tool created at Brown University’s Child Development Center can guide an appropriate sleep history: Between 75% and 100% of children who have OSA snore. A comprehensive sleep history also should include questions about enuresis, which has a strong predictive value for OSA, as well as diaphoresis and hyperextension of the head during sleep.The physical examination findings may be entirely normal in children who have OSA. Careful measurement of weight and height is important; affected children may lose weight and fail to grow because of interrelated difficulties with eating and chronic hypoxemia. The association of obesity with OSA is more prevalent in the adult population; almost 30% of children who have OSA are underweight.The presence of dysmorphic facies, mouth breathing, hyponasal speech, or cleft palate should raise the physician’s suspicion for OSA. A careful examination of the nose may reveal obstruction from polyps, septal deviation, hypertrophied adenoids, or even a foreign body. In the oropharynx, the size of the tonsils should be noted on a scale of 0 to 4; macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hypothyroidism), micrognathia (Pierre Robin or Goldenhar sequence), or retrognathia may predispose a child to OSA. A complete neurologic examination is indicated because OSA can be associated with cerebral palsy or hypotonia.Most children who have OSA have no laboratory evidence of their disorder. Polycythemia, respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography are present only in the most severe cases. Radiographs may be useful in determining the cause of OSA. Among children who do not have tonsillar hypertrophy, a lateral neck radiograph can assess the size of the adenoids. In the absence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy, nasopharyngoscopy may assist in determining the cause of OSA.Several different strategies are available for confirming the diagnosis of OSA. Overnight pulse oximetry with in-hospital observation has a high positive predictive value in confirming OSA. At home, parents can record a sleep audiotape, although one limitation of this technique is the inability to identify a component of central apnea. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) can provide additional information when results of a sleep history and audiotape are inconclusive. It evaluates daytime sleepiness by measuring how long it takes a patient to fall asleep at different times. Having a short mean sleep latency (<10 min) during the day is abnormal, but the MSLT is of limited use in pediatrics because excessive daytime sleepiness is more common with obesity, which is not the usual finding among children who have OSA.The gold standard for diagnosing OSA remains polysomnography (PSG). The four essential components of a polysomnogram are a chest wall motion detector, nasal air flow meter, heart rate monitor, and a pulse oximeter. More complex instruments may have a pH probe and provide electroencephalographic monitoring. In 1996, criteria were set to standardize PSG interpretation in children. An abnormal study is defined by an apnea index (AI) greater than 1, an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 5, blood carbon dioxide levels of 45 mEq/L (45 mmol/L) for more than 60% of sleep time or 50 mEq/L (50 mmol/L) for more than 10% of sleep time, and a minimum oxygen saturation lower than 92%.Not all children suspected of having OSA require PSG, particularly when the indication for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is already clear. PSG can provide critical information when there is uncertainty about the severity of OSA, in the presence of severe neurologic disease, with a very young child, and with a medical condition that might complicate surgical intervention. The major disadvantages of PSG are its expense and the time required for the study.As Drs. Matiz and Roman point out, the association between OSA and obesity is not as strong in children as it is in adults. About one third of children who have OSA actually are underweight, which makes sense, considering how failure to thrive might well be the consequence of poor sleep and chronic hypoxemia in a growing organism. The association of massive obesity with hypoventilation, daytime somnolence, and OSA has been called the Pickwickian syndrome. In fact, the syndrome is misnamed. In Dickens’ Pickwick Papers, the hero, although portly, is neither obese nor somnolent, and he is not remarkable for his snoring. Mr. Wardle’s young servant, known as “the fat boy, Joe,” has all the appropriate characteristics, but “Joe’s syndrome” doesn’t have much of a ring.",

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects.

      "title": "Excessive Sleepiness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "title": "0984 Near Drowning: A Complex Case of Somnolence and Weakness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy is a disorder of sleep characterized by pathologic daytime sleepiness classically divided into two major subtypes – those with or without cataplexy. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is thought to be related to hypocretin/orexin; pathologically low levels of hypocretin characterize narcolepsy with cataplexy. We present a complex case of weakness in a patient evaluated for narcolepsy. Report of case(s) A 38 year-old male with a BMI of 33 presented with a decade of daytime sleepiness and sudden debilitating attacks of muscle weakness. He underwent level III home sleep testing revealing a respiratory event index of 5.3/h. After an unsuccessful trial of mandibular advancement, he was started on positive airways pressure (PAP) but continued to experience daytime sleepiness and episodes concerning for cataplexy including sensation of legs feeling stiff and falling with stress. He also described episodes of weakness while swimming with inability to stand or stabilize, prompting evaluation for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Sleep diary showed average nightly sleep of 6.5 hours, low sleep latency, and refreshing napping. He underwent PSG while using CPAP 8 cm H2O showing AHI 0.2/h, sleep time 6.2 hours, sleep latency 5.5 minutes and REM latency 33 minutes with evidence of REM sleep without atonia. He underwent MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of 7.6 minutes and 3/5 REM sleep onset periods. Therapeutic trials of venlafaxine and pitolisant did not result in symptomatic improvement, and further genetic testing with HLA DQB-1 was negative. CSF hypocretin measurement was normal (329 pg/mL, reference &amp;gt; 200 pg/mL). These effectively ruled out cataplexy as the cause of his weakness. He continued on PAP therapy, venlafaxine, and modafinil 200 mg for hypersomnia/narcolepsy without cataplexy with good response. Conclusion We present a complex case highlighting the utility of HLA and confirmatory CSF testing in the evaluation of cataplexy with episodes of acute weakness accompanying stress and strong emotion, with particularly dangerous events during swimming. Due to lack of therapeutic response despite positive MSLT, further testing with HLA and CSF hypocretin were pursued. This case highlights the limitations of history alone in the diagnosis of cataplexy, and the utility of advanced testing. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows the bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and dementia. Sleep disorders often precede cognitive impairment by many years, in keeping with evidence that certain degenerative diseases originate from the brainstem and hypothalamus. Such selective vulnerability is associated with sleep fragmentation, daytime napping, sleep phase disorders, insufficient or excessive sleep duration, and sleep-disordered breathing. However, recent research indicates that sleep disorders accentuate neuropathology, such as decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS) promoting amyloid aggregation. This bidirectional relationship makes for a self-promoting feedback loop that accelerates both processes, highlighting the need for early interventions in elderly patients without dementia. Behavioral interventions, such as sleep hygiene, daytime exercise, and avoidance of alcohol and coffee after a certain time of day, are important first steps. Equally important are interventions that promote sleep consolidation, enhance SWS, or correct sleep-disordered breathing. Finally, optimizing medication timing, such as daytime-only use of cholinesterase inhibitors, can improve sleep and memory consolidation. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2017;47(5):227–238.]",

The prevalence of MND is approximately five per 100 000 and approximately 30% of patients have primary bulbar symptoms.1 Half of the patients die within 36 months of experiencing the first symptom.\n\nPresentation with ventilatory failure is recognised but uncommon,2 occurring in less than 5% of cases3; however, abnormalities of respiratory muscle function are frequently detectable.4 5 As the condition progresses respiratory muscle strength diminishes4 6; indeed, the rate of change in respiratory function is the only measurable parameter which predicts survival.1 When the load placed on the respiratory muscle pump exceeds the capacity of the respiratory muscles, then the patient is at risk of ventilatory failure. Initially abnormalities may be present only in sleep7 or on exercise8 but, frequently, established ventilatory failure ensues. Ventilatory failure is usually manifest by dyspnoea which may be worse on lying flat (if diaphragm weakness is prominent) or sitting upright (if expiratory muscle weakness predominates). More commonly there is generalised weakness and then there are no clear cut postural symptoms. Direct questioning may elicit symptoms suggestive of disordered sleep architecture—for example, daytime somnolence, difficulty concentrating, or “respiratory” nightmares—or carbon dioxide retention—for example, morning headache. Examination may show paradoxical abdominal motion during respiration. This indicates substantial diaphragm weakness9 combined with preservation of enough upper thoracic musculature to generate sufficient negative intrathoracic pressure to cause inward abdominal motion. In more advanced disease paradoxical motion may be difficult to elicit and the patient may simply appear tachypnoeic without useful rib cage movement.

Dreamlike behavior is observed during REM sleep in patients with brainstem damage or sometimes in the healthy elderly people. The presence of sleep disturbance, hypnagogic hallucination, and dreamlike behavior suggests that there may be some relationship between OPS and REM sleep. Considering that REM sleep is suppressed by serotonergic projection of the dorsal raphe nucleus in addition to several reports about brainstem lesion with serotonergic abnormalities in this disorder, we considered that dysfunction of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus might be related in the development of OPS.",

Esta obstruccion dificulta la respiracion provocando entre otros sintomas, sueno fragmentado y perdida o supresion de las fases de sueno mas profundas. Durante el dia, la persona se queja de una sintomalogia muy variada, en la que destacan principalmente la excesiva somnolencia diurna y los cambios en el estado de animo y en la funcion cognoscitiva. Por lo que respecta al funcionamiento cognoscitivo, se ha observado un deficit de memoria a corto plazo, en el aprendizaje verbal, la percepcion, el pensamiento y la comunicacion. Tambien se observa un deficit en las funciones ejecutivas.\n\nEn la actualidad, a Presion Nasal Positiva Continua (CPAP) constituye el tratamiento estandar para este tipo de pacientes. Diversos estudios han evaluado la eficacia del tratamiento en la sintomatologia del SAOS, aunque los resultados no han sido muy concluyentes. Es decir que se han identificado casos en los que algunos pacientes presentaron mejoria significativa en algunas funciones cognoscitivas, en tanto que en otros no se observaron estas mejorias a pesar de la disminucion observada en sus niveles de somnolencia diurna. Por ello en el presente estudio y con base en los resultados de estudios previos analizados, el objetivo fue evaluar los efectos de la CPAP en la memoria a corto plazo en pacientes con SAOS, despues de un mes de tratamiento.\n\nMaterial y metodo: Sujetos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 44 pacientes (42 hombres y 2 mujeres) con SAOS, que fueron seleccionados en un centro hospitalario.

En todos los pacientes se empleo la CPAP como tratamiento.\n\nInstrumentos Para establecer el diagnostico de SAOS se realizo una poligrafia cardiorrespiratoria de todas las horas de sueno (MODELO SEFAM U-280).Este procedimiento, incluye un registro del electrocardiograma, movimientos toracicos y abdominales, flujo aereo a traves de la nariz y la boca y nivel de saturacion de oxigeno en la sangre.\n\nLa prueba de digitos del WAIS (orden directo e inverso) se utilizo para evaluar la memoria a corto plazo.\n\nPara el tratamiento del trastorno se emplearon el Sistema CPAP Nasal SULLIVAN V y el Sistema CPAP PV 100.\n\nProcedimiento Todos los pacientes recibieron diagnostico y tratamiento en la unidad de sueno perteneciente a un centro hospitalario. A cada paciente, se le practico un examen y se le hizo una entrevista medica con el objetivo de recabar algunos datos de especial relevancia para el diagnostico del trastorno. Finalizada la exploracion, se cito al paciente para dormir esa noche en la unidad de sueno donde se le realizaria la primera poligrafia cardiorrespiratoria. E registro se iniciaba aproximadamente a las 11:30 p.m. y finalizaba a las 7:30 a.m. con lo que se registraban 8 horas de sueno. A la manana siguiente se analizaban los resultados obtenidos en el registro para determinar tanto si el paciente presentaba o no apnea obstructiva del sueno, asi como la gravedad del trastorno. Se selecciono como sujetos del estudio a todos aquellos pacientes que presentaron un indice de apnea-hipopnea superior a 10 y en quienes se habia instaurado la CPAP como alternativa terapeutica. Como criterio de exclusion, se establecio la manifestacion de alguna enfermedad psiquiatrica pasada o presente, que de alguna manera pudiera influir en el funcionamiento psicologico del paciente.\n\nFinalizado el registro de las horas de sueno, se procedio a la evaluacion de la memoria a corto plazo. La prueba se realizo aproximadamente entre las 9:30 y las 10:30 de la manana, y se llevo a cabo en el mismo lugar y en identicas condiciones para cada uno de los sujetos. Su aplicacion fue individual.\n\nConcluida esta fase, se cito al paciente aproximadamente al mes de haber iniciado la terapia con CPAP, para llevar a cabo una nueva evaluacion de la memoria a corto plazo en las mismas condiciones que en la situacion pre-tratamiento. Un equipo especializado evaluo el proceso de cumplimiento de la terapia, que alcanzo 5,51 de tratamiento horas al mes.\n\nResultados: Los resultados del analisis de varianza con medidas repetidas indicaron que existe un efecto significativo principal en el factor tratamiento; es decir, que se encuentran diferencias estadisticamente significativas (p < 0,05) en la memoria a corto plazo despues de un mes del tratamiento con la CPAP.\n\nConclusiones: Los resultados anteriores muestran que a CPAP mejora el funcionamiento cognoscitivo de los pacientes con SAOS y que se incrementa el numero de digitos recordados, en una tarea de memoria a corto plazo. Esto puede deberse, entre otras razones, a una mejoria en el nivel de somnolencia diurna o bien a una mejoria significativa en los niveles de saturacion de oxigeno SaO2).",

      "abstract": "Sleep starts, also called hypnagogic or hypnic jerks, are bilateral, sometimes asymmetric, usually single, brief body jerks that coincide with sleep onset. We describe sleep starts occurring repetitively in three epileptic children with spastic-dystonic diplegia and mental retardation. Repetitive sleep starts began at age 18 months in two children and at 9 months in the third. All three children had had feto-neonatal asphyxia; two presented with spastic and one with dystonic tetraparesis. One had West syndrome and two had partial motor seizures in the first year of life. Seizures were controlled in all three patients by antiepileptic drug therapy. Video/EEG recordings of all the children during the afternoon nap revealed clusters of sleep starts during the transition between wakefulness and sleep. Cluster lasted 4-15 min and comprised from twenty to twenty-nine contractions. The EEG counterpart of the event sometimes showed an arousal response, at times inducing complete awakening. Repetitive sleep starts should be recognized and clearly differentiated from epileptic seizures, especially if they appear in epileptic subjects. In neurologically compromised patients, they could represent an intensification of an otherwise normal event, due to the lack of strong inhibitory influence of the pyramidal tract resulting from the pyramidal lesion.",

      "title": "Home Sleep Apnea Testing",
      "abstract": "The awareness of sleep disorders has exponentially grown in the last 30 years. Polysomnography is considered the gold standard test for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing. However, complete polysomnography is not easily available in most countries, access is poor, and there is a shortage of trained sleep technicians and sleep physicians. In addition, polysomnography is an expensive test that requires an initial investment, physical space dedicated to sleep-lab-related activities, and expensive equipment that needs continuous maintenance and supplies. Many insurances and third-party payers have specific requirements before polysomnography can be performed. A certain level of expertise is needed for high-quality signal acquisition and the ability to differentiate the artifact from the genuine signal. From patients' perspective, they sleep in a new environment that they are not used to and can have a difficult time falling asleep, as well as disturbed sleep on the night of testing. This phenomenon is called the \"first night effect.\" Some patients are used to bedtime rituals at home and occasionally an alcoholic drink that is generally not allowed in the setting of sleep labs. This clearly has the implication of altered circumstances that do not represent a patient's habitual sleep environment. There is a significant interest in developing alternate methods to diagnose disorders, specifically sleep disordered breathing also known as sleep apnea. The development of predictive formulas, algorithms, and diagnostic tools have not been able to fill this gap. Out of center sleep testing (OCST) for sleep apnea is known by many terms: portable sleep testing, home sleep testing (used by CMS), and portable monitoring, just to list a few. The most popular term is \"home sleep apnea testing\" (HSAT). This term is precise and descriptive of what is actually being done and where.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Blood pressure varies throughout the day and night and is maintained at different times by different control systems. During the awake interval, the sympathetic nervous system is preeminent but during sleep the renin angiotensin system is the controller. Sleep blood pressure is a more powerful predictor of non‐haemorrhagic cerebro‐ and cardiovascular events in animals and humans, despite the sleep value being lower than the day value. Drugs that act independently of the hormonal or neural systems, such as diuretics and calcium channel blockers, have similar effects during sleep and awake intervals. Beta‐blockers have little effect during sleep when the activity of the sympathetic is low while drugs that interfere with the action of the renin angiotensin system have a greater blood pressure lowering effect during sleep. One aim of therapy should be to ensure that blood pressure is low during sleep and drugs should be used in doses that lower blood pressure throughout the 24 h period.",

      "abstract": "Chest wall disorders are a group of thoracic deformities that result in inefficient coupling between the respiratory muscles and the thoracic cage. The disorders are usually characterized by a restrictive defect and share the potential of long term hypercapnic respiratory failure, the most common chest wall abnormality leading to respiratory failure is Thoracoplasty, Scoliosis and/or kyphoscoliosis may also cause severe respiratory failure, symptoms of respiratory failure include: dyspnoea on exertion, peripheral oedema, orthopnoea, repeated chest infections, morning headaches, fatigue, poor sleep quality and loss of appetite. Dyspnea is the term generally applied to sensations experienced by individuals who complain of unpleasant or uncomfortable respiratory sensations such as chest wall diseases, Many definitions of dyspnea have been offered, including: “difficult, labored, uncomfortable breathing” an “awareness of respiratory distress”, “the sensation of feeling breathless or experiencing air hunger”, and “an uncomfortable sensation of breathing”(Wright., and Branscomb., 1954, Wasserman., and Cassaburi., 1988, Simon., et al., 1989). The sensation experienced by an individual during physical effort will evoke very different reactions than the same sensation occurring at rest, physical effort is impact in symptoms of dyspnea, quality of life, and functional capacity in patients with chest wall diseases who continuous with smoking more than non-smoking and may also have a favorable impact on mortality and hospitalizations, the sensation of dyspnea is increased in patients with chest wall diseases by routine duties which require arm and leg use, especially activities which involve high effort (Breslin, 1992). Tobacco smoking is the main etiological factor for the development of chest wall diseases, cigarette smoking is estimated in western societies to account for around 85% of the risk of developing chest wall diseases, Eagan et al. (2004) reported that the risks of dyspnea, cough, wheezing and mucous production are increased by active cigarette smoking and that these features are directly related to the amount of cigarettes smoked.",

Postural hypotension may be a presenting feature in certain autonomic disorders (such as pure autonomic failure), it may be a pointer towards an alternative diagnosis (as in multiple system atrophy presenting with parkinsonian features), and it may complicate drug therapy (as with levodopa). Postural hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and also mortality, especially in elderly people, in whom falls result in injuries. Advances have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes, and in the treatment of postural hypotension.\n\nPostural hypotension usually is considered when there are characteristic features resulting from cerebral ischaemia such as loss of consciousness (fainting, syncope). Other symptoms may occur (table1).2 Measuring blood pressure while lying and after 2 minutes of standing often confirms a postural fall. However, the lack of a fall, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, should warrant further investigation.

      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

      "title": "Non-Intrusive Analytical Approaches to Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Samy, Lauren | Advisor(s): Sarrafzadeh, Majid | Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and the most prevalent sleep disorder in general. Approximately 22 million people in the United States and more than 100 million people worldwide are affected by this serious disorder. The disorder is characterized by repeated involuntary breathing cessations (apnea) or reductions in breathing (hypopnea) during sleep, accompanied by oxygen desaturation (hypoxia). The apneas occur due to the obstruction of the upper airway as a result of the relaxing of throat tissue. The hypoxia triggers a brain activity arousal to restore the normal breathing pattern until the next apneic episode occurs. OSA patients can experience hundreds of apneas per night. The frequent sleep disruptions and the resulting fragmented sleep pattern can have serious physical and psychological consequences and can lead to premature death. Because the apnea episodes rarely trigger a full awakening, patients are often unaware of having difficulty breathing at night. As a result of this unawareness, OSA is severely underdiagnosed. This problem is exacerbated by the intrusiveness of current diagnosis methods. Polysomnography---the traditional gold-standard diagnosis method---requires close overnight monitoring of patients' body functions, making it an uncomfortable and intrusive diagnostic test. Intrusive diagnosis methods discourage patients from getting tested for OSA until they experience its serious health effects. As a result, many patients remain untreated and OSA continues to be a major public health problem that places a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. In an effort to increase the level of diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, this work investigates the design and implementation of effective non-intrusive OSA diagnostic methods. We explore two kinds of detection methods: nocturnal methods that rely on diagnosing OSA by detecting apneic episodes from overnight recordings, as well as daytime methods which use features and signals that can be obtained while the subject is awake. This work involves identifying the data to be collected, building the appropriate systems to obtain them, and using machine learning techniques to analyze them. The effectiveness of our methods was proven using real data from clinical trials. Daytime methods quickly revealed their advantages over the common nocturnal methods and the few existing daytime methods.Experimental results show that our daytime methods perform the initial diagnosis of OSA non-intrusively without significantly affecting the diagnosis accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art nocturnal methods.",

      "title": "Sleep and headache disorders",
      "abstract": "The association between sleep and headache disorders was recognized well over a century ago. Early observations described the influence of sleep in both provoking and relieving headaches.1,2 For example, in 1871, Wright1 in his headache textbook observed that, among other headache triggers, 'The causes that predispose to the occurrence of sick headache [include] insufficient sleep' (p 32) and 'waking from a deep sleep' (p 94). Wright also identified headache as a likely consequence of obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation syndrome in his description of the 'predisposition to suffer from headaches' related to 'The habit of the body, age of the patient, with insufficient exercise, over-indulgence in sleep' (pp 71-72). Such early clinical observations foretold later research concerning sleep-related headache precipitants and headache secondary to sleep-disordered breathing.",

      "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the incidence, types, determinants, and consequences of sleep disorders in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and determine whether their characteristics are similar to those of patients with Parkinson9s disease (PD). <b>Methods:</b> Information about sleep disorders was collected using a standardised questionnaire in an unselected group of 57 patients with MSA and in 62 patients with PD matched as a group for age, sex distribution, and disease duration. <b>Results:</b> Seventy percent of patients with MSA complained of sleep disorders compared with 51% of patients with PD (p=0.03). The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD. Sleep problems tended to be associated with more severe motor symptoms, longer disease duration, depression, and longer duration of levodopa treatment. Half of patients with MSA with sleep disorders complained of daytime somnolence compared with 30% of patients with PD. Daytime somnolence was significantly associated with disease severity in MSA. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study shows that sleep disorders are more common in patients with MSA than in those with PD after the same duration of the disease, reflecting the more diffuse underlying pathological process in MSA.",

A person with bipolar disorder cycles between these mood episodes throughout his or her lifetime, leading to significant impairment in functioning and overall quality of life. Sleep disturbances pervade the course of bipolar disorder, occurring before, during, and after mood episodes. Sleep disturbances also negatively impact the treatment outcome for individuals with bipolar disorder. Thus, interventions aimed at improving sleep in this clinical population are needed. This chapter discusses sleep disturbances in the context of bipolar disorder as well as empirically validated strategies to improve sleep specifically for bipolar disorder.",

Our report emphasizes the distinction between hypnopompic and hypnagogic hallucination as an ongoing feature of life that someone is aware of, which we believe to be the case for normal persons who have them, and a similar hallucination occurring for the first time in someone who is unaware of it, at least unable to remember it.

It results in intermittent hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, cortical arousals and surges of sympathetic activity. The occurrence of OSA has also been linked to serious long‐term adverse health consequences; such as hypertension, metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive deficits and motor vehicle accidents. There have been several advances in the field of particular clinical importance: (i) the development of portable monitoring as part of a simplified clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of OSA in selected patients; (ii) growing awareness of the cardio‐metabolic health consequences of OSA and (iii) emerging evidence to support a range of non‐continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment modalities, such as oral appliances.",

These events encompass abnormal sleep related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Parasomnias are classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. This sleep disorders in childhood are common, and often more frequent than in adults. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias have benign and self-limited nature. Most of the parasomnias may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Parasomnias in adults often differ in type from childhood parasomnias and may portend significant psychiatric disturbances or neurodegenerative disorders. A reliable diagnosis can often be made from a detailed history from the patient and, if possible, the parents or bed partner.

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

The activation of extrastriate and limbic structures, combined with a deactivation of primary visual and prefrontal cortices, appears to indicate the existence of a closed processing loop during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Slow waves are prominent characteristics of the later stages of nonrapid eye movement sleep and consist of highamplitude delta waves at 1–4 Hz and a slower oscillatory rhythm of less than 1 Hz. Rapid eye movements are some of the most prominent hallmarks of REM sleep and are believed to be related to the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves identified through cellular recordings in animals. Sleep disturbances are a common facet of depression and include problems in sleep continuity, reductions of slow-wave sleep, decreased REM latency, and increased REM density.",

Nightmare disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM behavior disorder (RBD), and status dissociatus (agrypnia excitata) are some of the REM parasomnias. Parasomnia overlap syndrome is a term used for parasomnias that occur in both REM and NREM sleep stages, such as catathrenia. RBD is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep stage and is characterized by acting out dreams (oneirism), leading to unwanted motor actions such as kicking, punching, or slapping, or sudden abrupt movements that can cause unexplained injuries to self or bedpartner. Memory of the associated dream is usually preserved. Diagnosis is obtained via video polysomnography with findings of REM activity without atonia and video recording of the oneirism. Treatment starts with developing a safety plan, improving sleep hygiene, and identifying any medications or other triggers such as snoring or leg movements. Melatonin, benzodiazepines, and a few other medications are used for treatment of RBD and other REM parasomnias. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2021;51(12):560–565.]",

Ambulatory polysomnography may be adequate in asymptomatic snorers (i.e., those without witnessed apneic episodes, daytime sleepiness, or significant associated disease processes) who seek treatment for social reasons. Split-night testing is a promising diagnostic protocol for symptomatic snorers. All snorers benefit from instruction on behavior modification. The best treatment option (fitting of an oral appliance, surgical intervention, CPAP) depends on whether apneic episodes accompany snoring and on patient preference.

They were free of perinatal and postnatal complications other than apnea. During their active or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep they showed significantly more apneic episodes which were also longer lasting and they were accompanied by bradycardia of a greater severity. The organization of the immature nervous system with a preponderance of inhibitory synaptic connections and the additional inhibition of spinal motoneurons during REM sleep are likely to be the cause of apneic spells in otherwise \"normal\" preterm infants.",

The only animal model for OSA is the English bulldog (1), which serves as a model for OSA secondary to craniofacial anomalies (midfacial hypoplasia), rather than the more common human condition of OSA secondary to obesity. Despite attempts to develop animal models of OSA related to obesity, even very obese animals, such as pigs or obese knockout mice, do not develop OSA. Why then, does this disease occur so often in humans? The human pharynx has several functions which compete with each other (2), including breathing (during which the pharynx must remain patent) and swallowing (during which the pharynx must collapse). Some unique characteristics of the human have affected the ability of the upper airway to perform these different functions: the ability of humans to perform complex speech, and the upright position of humans compared to quadrupedal animals. This inherent tendency for the human upper airway to collapse predisposes it to abnormal collapse during sleep, that is, obstructive apnea.",

NDE are responses to life-threatening crisis characterized by a combination of dissociation from the physical body, euphoria, and transcendental or mystical elements. Persons with NDE may have an arousal system predisposed to allowing intrusion of REM sleep elements during the transition between wakefulness and sleep.2 The arousal system is comprised of brainstem structures controlling or influencing sleep-wake states, alertness, and attention. REM intrusion manifests as the atonia of sleep paralysis (or cataplexy), as well as visual or auditory hallucinations. Although not considered REM intrusion, OBE and the REM state have an established relationship that is incompletely understood. In the state boundary disorder of narcolepsy, individuals often give accounts of OBE,3,4 which diminish after the narcolepsy is treated.4 In this study, we investigated if OBE in subjects with NDE could be regarded an arousal phenomenon by occurring during sleep transition or corresponding to REM intrusion.\n\nStructured interviews were conducted and REM intrusion measured in 55 subjects with NDE, and compared to age- and gender-matched controls as previously described.2 All gave informed consent as approved by the institutional review board. OBE during NDE was determined by the Greyson questionnaire asking if the respondent “Clearly left the body and existed outside it.” For OBE of sleep transition, subjects …",

We reported the simultaneous occurrence of sleep spindles and alpha activity in the waking EEG in 12 patients with a mean age of 59.0 years. Most of the patients were diagnosed as cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral arteriosclerosis, transient ischemic attack and vascular dementia. The mean alpha frequency in the presence of WSA significantly decreased by 1.5 Hz. The frequency and spatial distribution of waking spindle activity were similar to those of sleep spindles. In our cases, at least the two factors of cerebrovascular involvement and older adults were considered to be primarily responsible for the intrusion of sleep spindles into wakefulness (presumably a state close to very light drowsiness) due possibly to the instability of sleep-waking cycle regulation.",

However, these complex behaviors can also occur in other sleep disorders, a clinical situation termed as \"pseudo-RBD\". Anecdotal reports of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome simulating the clinical features of RBD have been reported. It has been suggested that \"pseudo-RBD\" is a form of a confusional arousal caused by a combination of severe oxyhemoglobin desaturations and other unknown factors. However, there have been no previous reports of RBD-like behaviors associated with central sleep apnea. Here, we describe two patients who reported complex motor and vocal behavior mimicking RBD, but REM sleep without atonia was not observed in video-polysomnography (VPSG). Furthermore, VPSG demonstrated severe central sleep apnea-hypopnea inducing abnormal motor and vocal behaviors.

Most antidepressants alter the physiological patterns of sleep and eventually improve sleep symptoms, along with other symptoms of depression. However, many antidepressants also have unwanted adverse effects on sleep, notably by causing or worsening insomnia, daytime sleepiness or sedation. This article briefly reviews the biology of sleep, the sleep disturbances associated with depression, and the therapeutic and adverse effects of antidepressants on sleep. It also describes a novel antidepressant, agomelatine, which improves symptoms of depression and rapidly relieves sleep complaints without sedative effects.",

      "abstract": "Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered by physicians in their daily clinical practice. This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

Pischacha grahonmada (PG) is one among those 18 types. No works are available on PG till date. The concept of PG and its clinical application is unclear due to the scarcity of published literature on this topic. The aim of the present study is to explore the condition of PG in terms of contemporary psychiatric literature. Ayurvedic literature pertaining to \"Pishacha grahonmada\" has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and their commentaries. Electronic databases have been searched to find out the relevant psychiatric and/or neuropsychiatric conditions which are similar to PG by using relevant keywords. PG is characterized by clinical features like Aswastha chittam (feeling uneasy), naikatra tishtantam (unable to sit at one place), paridhaavinam (wandering/pacing/running), dayita nritya geeta haasa ucchishta ratim (hypomania or mania like features), madya maamsa ratim (fond of eating meat, alcohol abuse), shunya nivaasa ratim (staying alone/social withdrawal), nirbhartsanaat (threatening others), deena shankita vadanam (depression with suspiciousness), nakhai aatma vapushi likhantam (self-injurious behavior with nails), nashta smriti (memory loss), baddhaabaddha bhaashinam (irrelevant speech), akasmaat rudantam (crying suddenly), dukhaani aavedayamaana (sharing his sorrows to everyone)/dukhaani avedayamaana (unable to feel pain), uddhvasta (nakedness), rooksha deha and swara (rough emaciated body and voice), durgandham/ashuchi (unhygienic), rathya chaila trina aabharanam (gross abnormal behavior), and bahvaashinam (hyperphagia). \"Nashta smriti\" is the unique symptom of PG and it denotes memory impairment commonly seen in conditions like dementia.

      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

Breathing may cease during light sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep because of upper airway obstruction, central cessation of respiratory drive, or a combination of both. Oxygen desaturation may follow either cessation or diminution of breathing and can lead to pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, cor pulmonale, and sudden death (2, 3). Patients with these disorders are usually fat, very sleepy, and extremely loud snorers; they may have congestive heart failure and frank disorders of respiratory control (pickwickian syndrome) (4).

      "abstract": "There are three major neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the sleep-waking cycle: the sleep system, the waking system, and the system that determines sleep-waking timing. Sleep dlisorders of older adults seem to be caused by functional or organic changes in one or more of the three systems, and are roughly classified into two categories: (i) normal age-related, and (ii) pathological. The former includes decreased amplitude and advanced phase of circadian rhythms (body temperature, melatonin secretion, and sleep-waking), as well as reduced sleep duration, sleep fragmentation, and a decrease of slow-wave sleep in sleep architecture. Pathological sleep disorders include medical and psychiatric diseases (e.g., lifestyle-related diseases, dementia, delirium, and depression) and primary age-related sleep disorders (e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder and periodic limb move- ment disorders). This mini-review delineates the clinical features of sleep disorders in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleep problems are important comorbid features of, and risk factors for, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To assess the prevalence and associations of sleep problems in patients with PD we analysed data from almost 54,000 participants in the Fox Insight study, including data from 38,588 patients with PD. Sleep problems are common in PD, with ~84% of respondents with PD reporting difficulty falling or staying asleep. Experiences of insomnia, restless leg syndrome, vivid dreams, acting out dreams, and the use of sleep medication are over‐represented in patients with PD compared with matched healthy controls. Male sex and PD onset before the age of 50 were also associated with a greater risk of sleep problems. A physician diagnosis of insomnia was associated with more symptoms of depression, impairment of cognition‐dependent independence, and a lower quality of life. Sleep problems were also associated with a higher prevalence of OFF periods compared with PD patients without sleep problems. 6.7% of PD patients endorsed sleep complaints as their most bothersome symptom, and reported non‐specific poor sleep quality as the most common sleep problem. These patients also had a better quality of life and lower depression and cognitive impairments than patients for whom postural instability was their most bothersome symptom, indicating the relative burden of sleep problems is contextualised by the severity of motor symptoms. Overall, these findings reinforce the high prevalence of sleep problems in a very large sample of PD patients, and indicate important associations of sleep problems with daily function and quality of life in PD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It has been suggested that sleep may have a positive effect on morning motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined this possibility and also looked at common sleep disorders in PD. Seventy‐eight PD patients and 43 normal elderly subjects answered a questionnaire. Of the PD patients, 43.6% reported improved motor symptoms in the morning, 37.2% worse, and 19.2% unchanged compared to the rest of the day. No difference was found between morning‐better and ‐worse groups with respect to age, duration or stage of PD; antiparkinsonian medications utilized, and predominant motor symptoms. However, the morning‐same group had a shorter duration of PD and less severe disease and required fewer dopaminergic medications. Sleep disorders were seen with equal frequency in the morning‐better and ‐worse groups. Our results suggest that sleep does not have a direct effect on morning motor function. Alterations in morning motor symptomatology probably represent a manifestation of motor fluctuations. Sleep fragmentation and spontaneous daytime dozing occurred much more frequently in PD patients than controls. In addition, nocturnal vocalizations and daytime hallucinations occurred only in the PD group.",

It reviews studies conducted through a pathology lens, where long sleepers frequently include individuals in poor physical or psychological health, who are often older and experience poor nocturnal sleep quality, including insomnia. Most epidemiological studies investigating sleepiness and the behavioral and psychological characteristics of long sleepers have examined the extremes of sleep duration relative to each other. Existing empirically supported models of sleep regulation postulate that duration and timing of sleep are regulated by an interaction between a circadian pacemaker, which programs daily cycles in sleep propensity, and a sleep homeostat, which tracks increases in sleep pressure. Investigations conducted outside the U-shaped pathology lens have also found that long sleepers who do not have insomnia are no sleepier than midrange sleepers.",

In people with asthma, this morning trough is associated with worsening of asthma symptoms and sleep disturbance. In individuals with heartburn at least once weekly, three-quarters complain of heartburn affecting their sleep. Polysomnography helps to clarify the nature and severity of the primary sleep disorder and aid in the management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Disruption of sleep is common in people with arthritic or muscular pain. Pain, sleep disturbance, and low mood are all believed to contribute to fatigue, a common complaint of those with rheumatic disorders.

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "abstract": "The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) represent a heterogeneous group of lysosomal storage disorders, each one associated with a deficiency in one of the enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan degradation. Sleep disorders are a frequent manifestation of all types of MPS. Underlying causes are diverse and comprised of both respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. Sleep disordered breathing such as obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation can arise in patients with upper airway obstruction and/or with alterations in respiratory mechanics, causing restrictive pulmonary disease. MPS patients with CNS disease can also develop sleep disturbances unrelated to ventilatory impairments, often associated with severe behavioral problems or night-time epileptic seizures. The present review discusses the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of sleep disorders in MPS based on information from a meeting on the brain in MPS, attended by an international group of experts (April 28–30, 2016, Stockholm, Sweden), and additional literature searches.",

Various alterations in gas exchange, especially during sleep, which promote hypoxemia can contribute to a positive feedback effect on ventilation. If gas exchange is further impeded by upper-airway obstruction, only a massive arousal response separates the infant from death.",

      "abstract": "Sleep Disorders in Old Age Abstract. Sleep disorders increase with age. Older patients rarely complain about sleep disorders, therefore it is important to ask about sleep problems. Insomnias, sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome tend to increase with older age. It is important to consider that sleep disorders may be the first symptom of a depression, anxiety disorder or neurodegenerative disorders such as dementias. Many factors can influence sleep in old age: it is important to inquire after sleeping habits including naps during the day, medication and comorbidity. Treatment depends on the causes. Insomnias should be treated mainly with non-pharmacological means such as cognitive behaviour therapy.Zusammenfassung. Schlafstörungen im Alter sind häufig und haben unterschiedliche Ursachen. Ältere Leute beklagen sich selten darüber, daher muss immer danach gefragt werden. Insomnien, schlafassoziierte Atemstörungen und das Restless-Legs-Syndrom nehmen im Alter zu. Nicht selten sind Schlafstörungen auch erstes Symptom anderer Erkrankungen. Bei Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen, aber auch bei neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen wie Demenzen oder dem Parkinsonsyndrom können sich Schlafstörungen vor kognitiven Störungen oder motorischen Beschwerden manifestieren. Schlafstörungen können auch Risikofaktor für andere Erkrankungen sein, wie zerebrale Ischämien und Herzrhythmusstörungen. Vieles muss bei der Diagnostik und Therapie berücksichtigt werden: Schlafgewohnheiten nachts und tagsüber, Medikamente und Begleiterkrankungen. Die Behandlung ist abhängig von der Ursache und sollte vor allem bei den Insomnien nicht-medikamentöse Therapien wie kognitive Verhaltenstherapie beinhalten.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

It describes epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for each of the excessive somnolence disorder. Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

Autopsy, which was performed in 2 of the cases, revealed Lewy bodies in various nervous tissues including autonomic nervous systems in both cases. 7 cases of probable DLBD and 8 cases of possible DLBD, which lacked fluctuating cognition and/or visual hallucinations, demonstrated neither of repeated falls, syncope, nor transient loss of consciousness. Episodes of these supportive features, which seem to be associated with autonomic dysfunctions and/or fluctuating cognition, should be important in the differential diagnosis of DLBD.",

Here, we describe clinical picture of sleep disorders in AD and the relation between sleep disorders and both cognitive impairment and poor prognosis of the disease. There are difficulties of the diagnosis of sleep disorders based on sleep questionnaires, polysomnography or actigraphy in the AD patients. Typical disturbances of the neurophysiological sleep architecture in the course of the AD include deep sleep and paradoxical sleep deprivation. Among sleep disorders occurring in patients with AD, the most frequent disorders are sleep breathing disorders – mainly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome and restless legs syndrome/periodic legs movements' syndrome. Sleep disorders may influence circadian fluctuations of the concentrations of amyloid-β in the interstitial brain fluid and in the cerebrovascular fluid related to the glymphatic brain system and production of the amyloid-β. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that disordered sleep contributes to cognitive decline and the development of AD pathology. In this mini-review, we highlight and discuss the association between sleep disorders and AD.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Hypoxia induced by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to the deregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), resulting in an abnormally increased sympathetic activity. Since ANS modulation varies throughout the night, notably for each sleep stage, the hypno-gram and heart rate signals of 81 OSA patients were collected during a polysomnography. They were classified as mild-moderate (n=44) or severe (n=37) based on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Spectral heart rate variability (HRV) series were extracted by a time-frequency approach. These series were then averaged for each sleep stage, in order to compare the sympathetic modulation of mild-moderate and severe patients at the following phases: rapid eye movement (REM), S1, S2 and SWS (slow wave sleep). According to normalized power at the low-frequency band (LF nu ) values, severe OSA seems to be associated with an increased sympathetic modulation at non-REM sleep. Moreover, a decreased autonomic variability throughout the night may be related to a reduced adaptability of the cardiovascular system, characterizing a more advanced stage of the disease. These results provide further evidence for the role of autonomic alterations induced by hypoxia, suggesting the use of HRV analysis, together with AHI, for the study of OSA severity.",

The relationship between headaches and sleep depends on the patients age, frequency and severity of the headaches, provoking factors (excessive sleep, sleep deprivation, overuse of painkillers), the stage of sleep (REM sleep or slow-wave sleep) and possible genetic predisposition (hemiplegic migraine).&#x0D; The connections between sleep and headaches are complex and interrelated.

General anatomical structures, neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in sleep and headache regulation are assumed.

Although its prevalence can be as high as 50% in the clinical samples and studies, clinicians may not remember to include paradoxical insomnia in the differential diagnosis. In this article, we present a patient, who was diagnosed with paradoxical insomnia for the first time in our polysomnography laboratory. The patient had accompanying sleep apnea and responded to the treatment with olanzapine and psychoeducation, comprising polysomnographic video recordings and instructions of sleep hygiene. Because this is the first case presentation from our country, characterized by the abovementioned clinical features; we think that this article may increase clinician awareness and contribute to the information in the literature.",

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

SDB refers to multiple diagnoses, including snoring, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA), sleep hypoxia, and sleep-related hypoventilation. The most prevalent among SDB is OSA, affecting almost 1 billion people globally. While sleep apnea can develop in any individual, risk factors associated with increased risk include: obesity, age, male sex, family history, and use of alcohol and sedatives. Upper airway obstruction in OSA can lead to different physiological changes, including decreased oxygen saturation, sleep fragmentation, and changes in heart rate. Long-term consequences include daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life, hypertension, and increased rates of cardiometabolic disorders. Significant presenting symptoms include snoring, poor sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. The diagnosis of sleep apnea requires a comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed sleep history and physical examination. Objective testing is needed for diagnosis and can be done at home or in a sleep laboratory. Different treatment options for sleep apnea include lifestyle change modifications, positive airway pressure (PAP), oral appliances, or surgery.",

Aims A systematic exploration of circadian time patterns in individuals with schizophrenia with recurrent sleep disruption. Method We examined the relationship between sleep–wake activity, recorded actigraphically over 6 weeks, along with ambient light exposure and simultaneous circadian clock timing, by collecting weekly 48 h profiles of a urinary metabolite of melatonin in 20 out-patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender and being unemployed. Results Significant sleep/circadian disruption occurred in all the participants with schizophrenia. Half these individuals showed severe circadian misalignment ranging from phase-advance/delay to non-24 h periods in sleep–wake and melatonin cycles, and the other half showed patterns from excessive sleep to highly irregular and fragmented sleep epochs but with normally timed melatonin production. Conclusions Severe circadian sleep/wake disruptions exist despite stability in mood, mental state and newer antipsychotic treatment. They cannot be explained by the individuals' level of everyday function.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "title": "Sleep-related epilepsies in the course of development in childhood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

      "title": "Olfactory dysfunction in patients with narcolepsy with and without REM sleep behaviour disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) frequently develop Parkinson's disease and the majority present with hyposmia, which is a potential preclinical non-motor sign of Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, it has been proposed that the clinical symptoms of hyposmia and RBD in combination have to be considered as very early symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Since not only patients with idiopathic RBD but also patients in whom RBD is associated with narcolepsy present with an olfactory dysfunction we investigated if hyposmia in RBD patients with concomitant narcolepsy is RBD specific or if narcolepsy per se is associated with olfactory dysfunction. We studied olfactory function in 20 narcoleptic patients each with RBD (9 male and 11 female; mean age 45.4 +/- 14.0 years, range 20-75 years) and without associated RBD (8 male and 12 female; mean age 44.4 +/- 13.40 years, range 20-70 years) and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects using standardized 'Sniffin' Sticks'. Both, narcoleptics with (Narc/+RBD) and without RBD (Narc/-RBD) had a significantly higher olfactory threshold (Narc/+RBD, P = 0.0001; Narc/-RBD, P = 0.0001), lower discrimination scores (P = 0.001; P = 0.014) and lower identification scores (P = 0.057; P = 0.003) than controls. There were no symptoms or signs for early parkinsonism in both patient groups. Our results show for the first time that narcolepsy per se is associated with olfactory dysfunction. In contrast to patients with idiopathic RBD, hyposmia in patients with RBD associated with narcolepsy is unlikely to be a predictor for developing parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Two types of sleep apnea have been identified: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). OSA occurs when the upper airway collapses; in OSA, there is no airflow, often despite great respiratory effort. In CSA, the transitory cessations of breathing are because of a drop in respiratory capacity—there is no airflow and no respiratory effort. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a consequence of both OSA and CSA. A comprehensive history, ideally obtained from both the patient and bed partner, is the essential first step in diagnosing sleep apnea, but the gold standard for assessing sleep apnea is the polysomnogram (PSG).",

      "abstract": "Refreshing sleep requires both sufficient total sleep time as well as sleep that is in synchrony with the individual's circadian rhythm. Problems with sleep organization in elderly patients typically include difficulty falling asleep, less time spent in the deeper stages of sleep, early-morning awakening and less total sleep time. Poor sleep habits such as irregular sleep-wake times and daytime napping may contribute to insomnia. Caffeine, alcohol and some medications can also interfere with sleep. Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.",

      "title": "15. Mechanisms of Dyspnea",
      "abstract": "The word dyspnea, wh ich refers to arespiratory sensation, comes from the Greek dus which means abnormal or difficult, and from pnein which means breathing. Thus, dyspnea could correspond to asensation of either abnormal breathing or difficult breathing, the two meanings not being equivalent. The medical approach tends to differentiate the abnormal from the normal. Thus, for the physician, dyspnea means a sensation of breathing which is abnormally hard for a given activity. The physician will usually not consider as dyspnea the sensation of breathing feit by anormal subject during exercise. Conversely, the physiologist tries to identify the sensory mechanisms of dyspnea, which, until now, have not been shown to be different in normal subjects and in patients. Thus, in physiological studies it is customary to consider any sensation of difficult breathing as dyspnea, whether in a normal situation or not. According to this definition, dyspnea can occur in very different conditions such as airway obstruction, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary vascular diseases, kypho­ scoliosis, neuromuscular disorders, heart failure, anemia, or exercise and loaded breathing in normal subjects. One question which is unresolved is whether a single sensory mechanism or different mechanisms account for dyspnea in all these situations. As we shall see, most studies on respiratory sensations used loaded breathing, which enables us to determine the relationship between a quantified stimulus and the sensation it evokes. Different origins have been considered for respiratory sensations such as dyspnea: the lungs, the upper airways, the rib cage, the respiratory musc1es, and the chemical drive. The lungs do not seem to playa role since the sensation evoked by an added load",

      "title": "Bipolar and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders feature a distinct period of mania or hypomania. For example, a patient might develop a relatively acute onset of euphoria, diminished need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and a variety of behavioral indiscretions. Absent complicating factors, such a patient would likely be readily identified as having a manic episode as part of bipolar I disorder. Complicating factors abound in diagnosing bipolar and related disorders, however, which is one reason that this chapter features an abundance of cases. Most of the complications relate to symptom evaluation. DSM-5 identified seven symptoms that tend to cluster in bipolar I disorder, and the diagnosis of mania requires three of these symptoms. Each of the symptoms requires clinical judgment in regard to both duration and intensity, and certain problems, such as \"distractibility\" and \"reduced need for sleep,\" are not always obvious during a clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of mania requires that symptoms from this cluster persist for most of the day, every day, for at least a week. This standard requires an accurate history, which can be difficult to obtain from any patient, but particularly from a patient who may have little insight into the presence of a psychiatric problem (as is often the case for individuals with bipolar disorder). An accurate bipolar history is even more difficult to obtain when the presenting symptom is depression, and manic symptoms might not have been present for many years. Half of patients with bipolar disorder use illicit substances, which can complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Depression is so commonly found in bipolar disorder that the disorder was previously called \"manic depression.\" The relationship between the two mood states is not always clear, however, which is one reason that bipolar and related disorders were shifted into a separate chapter in DSM-5. As it turns out, depression can be absent in bipolar disorder, but it can also be the dominant mood state in regard to both frequency and intensity of symptoms. Mood can oscillate between the two poles of depression and mania, or the two can coexist (e.g., a mood episode with mixed features). The relationship between the depressive and manic symptoms is made even more complicated by the reality that patients are more likely to spontaneously complain about dysphoria than about euphoria. Finally, as is generally the case for disorders throughout DSM-5, a bipolar diagnosis requires impairment. Some of the core symptoms of mania—increased activity, euphoria, and talkativeness—can lead to increased effectiveness and pleasure, at least in the short term, which further complicates the assessment. DSM-5 addressed these uncertainties by describing multiple syndromes within the bipolar spectrum. For example, diagnoses of mania and hypomania both require \"three of seven listed criteria, most of the day, nearly every day.\" However, mania requires at least one episode lasting at least 7 days, whereas hypomania requires only a 4-day duration. Instead of requiring a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, as specified for mania, hypomania requires an unequivocal change from baseline that is observable by others. These criteria take into consideration the reality that manic and hypomanic patients often lack insight, and the criteria emphasize that hypomania is less severe than mania. Hypomania is a key feature of DSM-5 bipolar II disorder. A second distinguishing feature of bipolar II disorder is the requirement for at least one major depressive episode at a time when hypomanic symptoms are not present. This requirement is in contrast to bipolar I disorder, which does not require the historical presence of depression. Other patients may have classic manic or hypomanic symptoms but with an apparent physiological precipitant. For example, a patient may have developed manic symptoms immediately after receiving prednisone, a steroid, for a flare-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). In this case, the clinician might conclude that the patient has bipolar disorder, which would presumably warrant a mood-stabilizing medication. Alternatively, the patient may have had a fairly common reaction to steroids and warrant a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar disorder (a disorder commonly and inaccurately labeled \"steroid psychosis\"); if so, a likely treatment would be reduction of the steroid medication. The patient's symptoms may, however, be best conceptualized as neuropsychiatric lupus, which in DSM-5 would be called bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. In that case, however, the patient might be best treated by an increase in steroids. One reason that the bipolar diagnosis is so hotly contested is that making the correct diagnosis is vitally important for patient care. The bipolar spectrum also includes clusters of individuals whose mania-related symptoms are significant but who do not meet criteria for bipolar I or II disorder by virtue of the number or duration of symptoms. For example, some patients have a chronic course of alternating hypomanic and subthreshold depressive symptoms. To reach the diagnostic threshold for DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, these symptoms need to be distressing and persistent (more days than not for at least 2 years—1 year in adolescents—with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and the individual should never have met criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode. DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder is quite parallel to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder in regard to both duration and intensity of symptoms. Other patients have significant manic symptoms, but an adequate history is not elicited because of the situation (e.g., an emergency room visit); in such cases, the diagnosis would be unspecified bipolar and related disorder. A variety of other patients are diagnosed with other specified bipolar and related disorder. These include people whose manic symptoms either persist for an inadequate duration (e.g., only 2–3 days rather than the required 4 days) or persist for greater than 4 days but do not meet the three of seven symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Still others meet criteria for hypomania but lack a history of major depressive disorder and therefore do not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. Others have chronic hypomania and subthreshold depressive symptoms but do not meet the 24-month criterion for cyclothymia. Bipolar spectrum diagnoses have generated significant controversy. One issue relates to duration. It is difficult to make a diagnosis in which the symptoms need be present for only a few days and do not necessarily cause significant distress. Another complication relates to symptom intensity. Distinguishing normal from abnormal is not always easy when the variables include such core human behaviors as talkativeness, risk taking, need for sleep, and self-esteem. To address this controversy, DSM-5 balances two competing interests. The first is to identify robust, discrete symptom clusters that occur within distressed patients. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for a cluster of disorders that cause significant dysfunction and distress and are accompanied by a lifetime risk of suicide that is more than 20 times that in the general population. The second competing interest is to avoid pathologizing normal human experience. Absent reliable tests for \"bipolar disorder,\" the onus is on the clinician to make use of these criteria and to follow available evidence in both the diagnosis and treatment of these challenging patients.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

      "title": "Sleep and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Over a century of work has confirmed critical links between sleep and epilepsy. Seizures can have profound effects on sleep, typically causing awakenings, arousals and shifts to lighter stages. However, sleep continuity is disrupted in people with epilepsy even in the absence of seizures, suggesting that sleep instability may be an inherent component of certain forms of epilepsy. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can adversely affect sleep and wakefulness. At least some of the newer AEDs appear to have more favorable sleep-wake profiles than the older agents. In turn, sleep is an important modulator of seizures and epileptic discharges on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Sleep instability can promote seizures and sleep deprivation provokes seizures and EEG abnormalities. Synchronized Non-REM (NREM) sleep facilitates seizures, whereas the clinical and EEG manifestations of epilepsy are suppressed in REM sleep. The sleep EEG is useful in the diagnosis and localization of epilepsy. New epileptic foci can appear in sleep and REM sleep demonstrates the most precise localization of the epileptic discharge. Polysomnography combined with video and EEG (VEEG-PSG) aids in the differentiation of seizures and parasomnias. Daytime sleepiness and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea are common in people with epilepsy. Treating sleep apnea has been shown to reduce EEG abnormalities and seizures in some cases. These observations underscore the importance of a routine sleep assessment in case of all the people with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

Because a mild hypocretin deficiency has been found in the brains of some patients with HD (hereinafter referred to as HD patients), we also tested the HD patients for narcolepsy. <h3>Design and Patients</h3> Twenty-five HD patients (including 2 premanifest carriers) underwent clinical interview, nighttime video and sleep monitoring, and daytime multiple sleep latency tests. Their results were compared with those of patients with narcolepsy and control patients. <h3>Results</h3> The HD patients had frequent insomnia, earlier sleep onset, lower sleep efficiency, increased stage 1 sleep, delayed and shortened rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased periodic leg movements. Three HD patients (12%) had REM sleep behavior disorders. No sleep abnormality correlated with CAG repeat length. Reduced REM sleep duration (but not REM sleep behavior disorders) was present in premanifest carriers and patients with very mild HD and worsened with disease severity. In contrast to narcoleptic patients, HD patients had no cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. Four HD patients had abnormally low (&lt; 8 minutes) daytime sleep latencies, but none had multiple sleep-onset REM periods. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The sleep phenotype of HD includes insomnia, advanced sleep phase, periodic leg movements, REM sleep behavior disorders, and reduced REM sleep but not narcolepsy. Reduced REM sleep may precede chorea. Mutant huntingtin may exert an effect on REM sleep and motor control during sleep.",

The aims of this review are first to describe sleep disturbances related to painful medical diseases and analgesics and secondly to propose management possibilities for these sleep disturbances.The viewpoints presented were based mainly on objective rest activity and sleep studies using actigraphy and polysomnography.Polysomnographic and actigraphic studies have described significant sleep disturbances in patients suffering from different pain disorders. These disturbances are: reduced sleep efficiency and altered sleep architecture characterized by increased wakefulness and stage 1 non-rapid eye movement sleep, associated with diminished slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Sleep disturbances may be related to pain and to the analgesic or sedative medications administered.If many factors, including pain, disease process per se, as well as medication, could disturb sleep, sleep disturbances may also adversely affect the natural course of the painful disease. Improving sleep quantity and quality in patients with painful disorders may break this vicious circle and as consequence enhance the patients' overall health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a multifactorial disease characterized by recurrent hypopnea or respiratory interruption during sleep, which causes intermittent hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sleep structure disturbances. An association between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the type of SAHS has rarely been reported in the literature. Here, we present a case of SAHS in a patient with AS and discuss the possible mechanism underlying the type of SAHS. Patient concerns: A 46-year-old man presented with a 15-year history of AS. He had been receiving sulfasalazine for symptomatic relief and had never been on immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with SAHS in addition to AS. Interventions: We instituted treatment with methylprednisolone (5 mg, oral, daily), leflumomide (20 mg, oral, daily), bicyclol tablets (25 mg, oral, 3 times a day), and ursodeoxycholic acid tablets (10 mg/kg, oral, daily). The patient received etanercept (50 mg, sc, once a week) as his condition deteriorated. In addition, for management of SAHS symptoms, the patient received nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. Outcomes: Six months after commencement of the treatment, the clinical manifestations of SAHS and AS had significantly improved. Conclusions: We hypothesize that patients with AS are prone to sleep apnea due to airway compression, central depression of respiration, abnormal inflammatory responses. Hence, careful assessment toward potential SAHS symptoms should be considered especially in patients with AS.",

We asked whether this deficit in spontaneous activation of mental processing may be reversed during REM sleep, when dreaming activity is potentially elicited by bottom-up brainstem stimulation on the cortex. Sleep and video monitoring over two nights and cognitive tests were performed on 13 patients with auto-activation deficit secondary to bilateral striato-pallidal lesions and 13 healthy subjects. Dream mentations were collected from home diaries and after forced awakenings in non-REM and REM sleep. The home diaries were blindly analysed for length, complexity and bizarreness. A mental blank during wakefulness was complete in six patients and partial in one patient. Four (31%) patients with auto-activation deficit (versus 92% of control subjects) reported mentations when awakened from REM sleep, even when they demonstrated a mental blank during the daytime (n = 2). However, the patients' dream reports were infrequent, short, devoid of any bizarre or emotional elements and tended to be less complex than the dream mentations of control subjects. The sleep duration, continuity and stages were similar between the groups, except for a striking absence of sleep spindles in 6 of 13 patients with auto-activation deficit, despite an intact thalamus. The presence of spontaneous dreams in REM sleep in the absence of thoughts during wakefulness in patients with auto-activation deficit supports the idea that simple dream imagery is generated by brainstem stimulation and is sent to the sensory cortex. However, the lack of complexity in these dream mentations suggests that the full dreaming process (scenario, emotions, etc.) require these sensations to be interpreted by higher-order cortical areas. The absence of sleep spindles in localized lesions in the basal ganglia highlights the role of the pallidum and striatum in spindling activity during non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is frequently acquainting as an abnormal accumulation of body fat to the degree that may cause serious health consequences. ( Yanovski et al. , 2014). One of the most common complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a widespread complaint that is closely associated with global obesity epidemics, and it is described as frequent complete or partial flop of the upper airway during sleep leading to gaseous exchange impairment and disturbance of sleep. It is the commonest category of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the world as reported in different epidemiological studies. (McNicholas et al ., 2007). Central sleep apnea : is described  as decreased respiratory effort leading to decrease or absence of ventilation .While in mixed apnea it is categorized by starting centrally and ending with obstructive events.In obstructive sleep apnea: the effort of  respiration is preserved but ventilation decrement  or absence due to partial or total obstruction in the upper airway; apnea is well-defined as the total airflow cessation lasting 10 sec. or more , There are three types of apneas :obstructive, central and mixed . A hypopnea: is defined as a reduction in airflow (30-50%) that is followed by an arousal from sleep or a decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation (3-4%)( The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999 and Kushida et al .,2005). The severity of sleep apnea is evaluated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. According to the American Academy of sleep Medicine recommendations , OSA is defined with AHI>5., and it is classified as mild OSA with AHI of 5 to 15;moderate OSA with AHI of 16 to 30;and severe OSA with AHI > 30.(The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force, 1999). The Apnea–Hypopnea Index or Apnoea–Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to determine sleep apnea severity. It is characterized by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation measurement gives a complete sleep apnea severity score that assesses the number of sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation.               (Ruehland et al .,2009 ). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apnea events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are categorized as Normal: 0-4;Mild Sleep Apnea: 5-14;Moderate Sleep Apnea: 15-29; Severe Sleep Apnea: 30 or more.(Ruehland et al ., 2009 ).",

      "title": "Aspects of the Relationship Between Sleep and Nutrition: A Study of 375 Psychiatric Out-Patients",
      "abstract": "Weight change and sleep disturbance are well documented features of psychiatric illness. Complaint about difficulty in getting off to sleep is a common feature of neurotic illness, especially anxiety states. Early morning waking has for many years been regarded by some as a clinical feature—almost a diagnostic pointer—for ‘endogenous depression‘. Motor restlessness is also commonly described as a feature of this disorder. However, other clinicians have concluded that such depressive illness is merely one end of the spectrum of the depressive response. In particular, McGhie (1966) has shown that sleep disturbances of all kinds, as reported by the patients themselves, may occur in a variety of psychiatric illnesses. For instance he found that early morning waking was reported in 16 per cent of non-depressed psychiatric patients as distinct from 17 per cent of patients presenting with depression. Moreover, Hinton (1963) has shown that early morning waking when carefully measured does not specifically characterize those types of depressive illness described by others as ‘endogenous', but that it can occur in all types of depressive illness. He also reported his observation that sleep disturbance amongst depressed patients is mostly related to the phenomenon of agitation. Agitated patients lost more sleep, most apparent in the latter part of the night. On the other hand Carney et al. (1965), in their study of over 100 patients with depression, found that certain symptoms clustered into two groups reflecting the usual concepts of ‘endogenous' and ‘neurotic’ depression respectively. Early morning waking and weight loss were important characteristics of their group of patients designated ‘endogenous' depression, and were regarded as important indicators for them of the value of ECT. There was a positive inter-symptom correlation of 0.234 between weight loss (7 lb.+) and early waking. Most studies do not suggest a causal link between weight change and sleep disturbance, but by inference regard these features as being more integral aspects of an underlying biological factor which also promotes the disturbed mood.",

      "abstract": "The state of sleep consists of different phases that proceed in successive, tightly regulated order through the night forming a physiological program, which for each individual is different but stabile from one night to another. Failure to accomplish this program results in feeling of unrefreshing sleep and tiredness in the morning. The program core is constructed by genetic factors but regulated by circadian rhythm and duration and intensity of day time brain activity. Many environmental factors modulate sleep, including stress, health status and ingestion of vigilance-affecting nutrients or medicines (e.g. caffeine). Acute sleep loss results in compromised cognitive performance, memory deficits, depressive mood and involuntary sleep episodes during the day. Moreover, prolonged sleep curtailment has many adverse health effects, as evidenced by both epidemiological and experimental studies. These effects include increased risk for depression, type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to voluntary restriction of sleep, shift work, irregular working hours, jet lag and stress are important factors that induce curtailed or bad quality sleep and/or insomnia. This review covers the current theories on the function of normal sleep and describes current knowledge on the physiologic effects of sleep loss. It provides insights into the basic mechanisms of the regulation of wakefulness and sleep creating a theoretical background for understanding different disturbances of sleep.",

Although sleep causes ventilatory disturbances of greater severity and variety than does sleep deprivation, the effects of sleep and sleep loss on respiration are similar. For example, both impair ventilatory drive and arousal responses to a variety of stimuli. Although the mechanism of impaired ventilation after sleep loss is not entirely understood, there is evidence to suggest that both respiratory muscle fatigue and central nervous system depression play a role. Patients who suffer from both disturbed sleep and lung disease are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of sleep disruption on breathing. Since sleep restoration returns many respiratory parameters to normal in sleep-deprived individuals, perhaps we should include rest in our treatment of certain patients with respiratory disease.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Because hot flashes can occur during the night, their presence has been frequently associated with insomnia in women with symptoms of menopause. However, many factors other than hot flashes or menopause can be responsible for insomnia, and several factors associated with insomnia in the general population are also commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who have hot flashes. <h3>Methods</h3> A random sample of 3243 subjects (aged ≥18 years) representative of the California population was interviewed by telephone. Included were 982 women aged 35 to 65 years. Women were divided into 3 groups according to menopausal status: premenopause (57.2%), perimenopause (22.3%), and postmenopause (20.5%). Hot flashes were counted if they were present for at least 3 days per week during the last month and were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their effect on daily functioning. Chronic insomnia was defined as global sleep dissatisfaction, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, for at least 6 months. Diagnoses of insomnia were assessed according to the<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>, classification. <h3>Results</h3> Prevalence of hot flashes was 12.5% in premenopause, 79.0% in perimenopause, and 39.3% in postmenopause. Prevalence of chronic insomnia was reported as 36.5% in premenopause, 56.6% in perimenopause, and 50.7% in postmenopause (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Prevalence of symptoms of chronic insomnia increased with the severity of hot flashes, reaching more than 80% in perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women who had severe hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, severe hot flashes were significantly associated with symptoms and a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Poor health, chronic pain, and sleep apnea were other significant factors associated with chronic insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severe hot flashes are strongly associated with chronic insomnia in midlife women. The presence of hot flashes should be systematically investigated in women with insomnia. Treating hot flashes could improve sleep quality and minimize the deleterious consequences of chronic insomnia.",

Sleep disorder can cause many complications, including the worsening of the brain injury prognosis. Insomnia occurs in 29% traumatic brain injury patient. Insomnia suspected due injury in inferior frontal, anterior temporal including basal forebrain, also sympathetic nerve hyperactivity. Insomnia increase the risk of stroke, disability and mood disturbance. Hypersomnia occurs in 28% traumatic brain injury patients. Hypersomnia suspected due orexin decrease and injury in sleep promoting area. Hypersomnia suspected related to recovery, less activity time and accident due sleepiness. There are no prevalence data of circadian rhythm disturbance after traumatic brain injury. This disturbance is caused by injury in supra-chiasmatic nucleus and related to global worsening on the patient. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly linked with injury area, but hypersomnia is not particularly linked to any area and only related to orexin decrease. Insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbance are highly related to the worsening condition on the patient, but hypersomnia is associated with recovery and not particularly related to any disturbances. It is hoped that understanding the sleep disorder after traumatic brain injury can rise the alertness of this matter and encourage clinicians to increase the quality of sleep disorder due to traumatic brain injury management. Cedera kepala merupakan salah satu cedera yang umum terjadi. Cedera ini sering diikuti dengan gangguan tidur seperti insomnia, hipersomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian. Gangguan ini sering dapat menyebabkan berbagai komplikasi termasuk memperparah penyembuhan cedera kepala. Insomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 29%. Insomnia diduga disebabkan oleh cedera pada daerah inferior frontal, anterior temporal termasuk basal otak depan, juga peningkatan kerja saraf simpatis. Insomnia meningkatkan resiko stroke, disabilitas dan gangguan suasana hati. Hipersomnia setelah cedera kepala terjadi sebanyak 28%. Hipersomnia diduga akibat penurunan orexin dan akibat kerusakan pada area yang mempertahankan bangun. Hipersomnia diduga berhubungan dengan penyembuhan, waktu tersita akibat tidur dan kecelakaan akibat mengantuk. Belum ada data prevalensi gangguan ritme sirkadian setelah cedera kepala. Gangguan ini disebabkan oleh cedera pada nukleus suprakiasmatik dan sering dikaitkan dengan perburukan kondisi pasien. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian sering dihubungkan dengan lokasi tertentu dari cedera, namun hipersomnia berhubungan dengan kadar orexin dan tidak terlalu dikaitkan terhadap area tertentu. Insomnia dan gangguan ritme sirkadian berhubungan dengan perburukan, namun hipersomnia bisa menandakan perbaikan dan tidak berhubungan signifikan dengan gangguan lainnya. Diharapkan dengan memahami gangguan tidur ini dapat meningkatkan kewaspadaan bagi para klinisi dan mendorong untuk penelitian berikutnya sehingga penanganan pasien gangguan tidur akibat cedera kepala dapat menjadi lebih baik.",

Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness. A family history of comorbid mood disorder and alcoholism may also point to bipolarity. Abrupt onset and/or termination of depressive bouts or relatively brief episodes ( Seasonal or postpartum depression. Winter-type seasonal affective disorder--feeling depressed in the fall and winter, hypomanic in the spring--and postpartum psychosis have clinical and epidemiologic links with bipolar disorder. Hyperphagia and hypersomnia--sometimes termed atypical features--are common in bipolar depression. …",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of disturbances of sleep comorbid with common neurologic disorders. Recent Findings: A wide variety of neurologic disorders are frequently complicated by comorbid sleep disturbances. In many cases, a bidirectional relationship appears to occur between sleep function and the neurologic disease, such that treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances may improve the symptoms of the neurologic disease. Summary: Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Hypoventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders often presents initially with sleep problems, and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have been frequently reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there is insufficient evidence to guide precise recommendations on some diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here, we review clinical studies dealing with sleep abnormalities in PD and present clinical recommendations. Previous studies describing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy-like episodes, circadian changes, sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, vivid dreams and restless legs syndrome are evaluated. Longitudinal studies associating sleep disorders with PD onset or clinical deterioration are rare: only one longitudinal study associated daytime sleepiness with PD onset. Evidence suggests that clinical investigations must include direct questioning about depressive symptoms, nocturnal cramps, pain, nocturia and nighttime off periods. A patient interview must be conducted regarding sleep symptoms, including nightmares, abnormal behavior during sleep, snoring, restless legs syndrome and daytime sleepiness. Initial evidence indicates that light therapy improves motor function and depression. Advice on sleep hygiene, the treatment of concomitant depression and the careful use of dopaminergic drugs and hypnosedative agents should be considered. To date, very few controlled studies are available to make a recommendation for the management of sleep-wake disturbances in PD.",

      "abstract": "Electrical status epilepticus in sleep involves an electroencephalographic pattern where interictal epileptiform activity is potentiated in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Near-continuous spikes and waves that occupy a significant proportion of nonrapid eye movement sleep appear as a result of sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity. This electroencephalographic pattern appears in different electroclinical syndromes that present three common characteristics with different degrees of severity: seizures, sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity, and neuropsychologic regression. Continuous spikes and waves during sleep comprise the severest epileptic encephalopathy in the electroclinical spectrum. Landau-Kleffner syndrome presents with intermediate severity. Some \"benign\" pediatric focal epileptic syndromes represent the mildest end of this continuum. Based on published data, we provide a framework for clinical and electrical events. The underlying mechanisms leading to sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity in electrical status epilepticus in sleep are incompletely understood. A genetic basis or acquired early developmental insult may disrupt the normal maturation of neuronal networks. These factors may dynamically alter normal processes of brain development, leading to an age-related pattern of electroclinical expression of electrical status epilepticus in sleep.",

      "abstract": "The circadian system is synchronized to the light-dark cycle generated by the rotation of the earth, ensuring that wake¬fulness is during the day and sleep occurs at night. However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

      "title": "Effects of partial sleep deprivation on subjectice emotion experience and implicit emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are not only defining features, but also diagnostic criteria for most psychiatric disorders. Recently, researchers have proposed a theoretic role for sleep disturbances in emotion dysregulation, subsequently linking neurobiological processes and psychopathology. Most prior research examining the potential role for sleep disturbance in emotion dysregulation is from a neurophysiological or clinical perspective, or primarily focused on maintaining processes. Less well understood are how sleep disturbances may be involved at the levels of predisposition, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation concurrently and over time.This dissertation presents findings from three studies that were designed to expand on what is known about sleep disturbance in the predisposition, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation. Study 1 examined the long-term relation between sleep-onset problems and neuroticism over twenty-years. Adolescent sleep-onset posed risk (predisposition) for neuroticism in midlife, not vice versa. Study 2 investigated the effects of 3-nights partial sleep deprivation (5-hours total time in bed) on the positive and negative affect and emotions of otherwise healthy adults. Following partial sleep deprivation, people reported significant reductions in positive affect and emotions compared to rested people (precipitation). The only impact on negative emotions was on the discrete level. Sleep deprived peo-ple reported significantly more irritability, loathing, hostility, and shakiness compared to controls. Study 3 measured adolescent sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and catastrophic worry. In addition to direct risk, sleep disturbances posed a non-gender specific risk for depressive symptoms one-year later through catastrophic worry (perpetuation). Overall, the results provide support for the role of sleep disturbances in the predis-position, precipitation, and perpetuation of emotion dysregulation. An implication is that sleep disturbances and catastrophic worry are two po-tentially modifiable markers of risk for emotion dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Although autonomic dysfunctions are key features, the frequency and timing vary between reports, and may accompany early insomnia. Moreover, endocrine changes are reported, but diabetes rarely is - with unclear timing of onset in relation to the insomnia. Methods: N/A Results: Here we present a 46-year-old previously healthy male, who within 22 months prior to the onset of sleep disturbances, developed hypertension and diabetes. Then within 3-4 months after onset of sleep disturbances development tachycardia and diaphoresis. His sleep continued to deteriorate, and later developed bulbar impairment, ataxia, diplopia, sleep apnea and cognitive decline. He passed away 20 months from onset of insomnia. Polysomnography showed status dissociates and central apnea. He had positive genetic testing, PRNP c.532G&gt;A (p.Asp178Asn) and PRNP c.385A&gt;G (pMet129Val), a pathological confirmation, and a positive family history Conclusions: Here diabetes and hypertension significantly preceded sleep disturbances, and tachycardia and diaphoresis developed shortly after. This illustrates that dysautonomia and endocrine dysfunction may be unrecognized prodromes in some cases of FFI, and could be an early marker of clinical disease onset and therapeutic interventions, especially in genetically confirmed asymptotic patients.",

There was insignificant difference between the two syndrome types (P>0.05). Some unique symptoms occurred in the two syndrome types as minor symptoms. Fatigue, abdominal distension after eating occurred in patients of Xin-Pi deficiency syndrome. Burning sensation of five centers, irritability, etc. occurred in patients of yin deficiency fire hyperactivity syndrome. Significant difference was shown in minor symptoms (except irritability, vexation, frequent urine) (P<0.05, P<0.01). No significant difference was shown in PSQI score between the two syndrome types (P>0.05). But significant difference was shown in sleep disturbance factors (P<0.05). Patients of yin deficiency fire hyperactivity syndrome had severe sleep disturbance factors.There was no significant difference in main symptoms between the two syndrome types. Some unique symptoms occurred in the two syndrome types as minor symptoms. There was difference in sleep quality compositions.",

      "title": "1053 Narcolepsy in Tourette syndrome",
      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a chronic disorder with involuntary motor and vocal tics. Sleep problems are common due to increased tics and comorbid conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Medications to treat tics or insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness. A 14-year-old male presents with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness of more than 1-year onset. He has a past medical history of Tourette syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and adenotonsillectomy due to recurrent pharyngitis. He is homeschooled, and sleeps between 10 pm to 6 – 10 am every day. Naps >2 h every day. Snoring, gasping and sleep talking are reported. His Epworth sleepiness score was 24. He denied hallucinations or cataplexy. He denied alcohol/drug abuse, trauma, hospitalization or family history of narcolepsy. Physical exam was unremarkable except BMI 35.29 kg/m2. His differential included obstructive sleep apnea vs. narcolepsy. His extended release guanfacine to treat tics was stopped, and Neurology held off starting an antidepressant for the sleep studies. The in-lab polysomnography showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index = 0.6/h, Total Sleep Time = 7.8 h, Sleep Latency = 1 min, REM Latency = 47.5 min, Sleep Efficiency = 85%, and Periodic Limb Movement Index = 0/h. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test showed a Mean Sleep Latency in 5 naps = 7 min and Sleep-onset REMs = 3, meeting criteria for narcolepsy. Anti-streptolysin O was less than 200 IU/mL. Guanfacine was switched to nights to reduce daytime sleepiness. Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was started at 5 mg BID due to palpitations and slowly increased to 20 mg extended release in the morning and 10 mg immediate release in the afternoon. Modafinil has also been added, and both sleepiness and tics are under control. This case reminds us that among other sleep related problems, narcolepsy can coexist in Tourette syndrome. It’s interesting that both conditions share an impaired hypothalamus‐hypophysis axis but are not commonly linked together. Management is a concern as stimulants can cause tics. We consider medically appropriate to assess and study their sleep problems and treating with stimulants when necessary to improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnia is a neurological disorder that refers to abnormal behavior during sleep. This disease has received increasing attention and research over the past few decades. In the 1950s, the symptoms of parasomnia were first described and further studied. This paper describes the three classifications of parasomnias, and details the symptoms and treatment options for these three classifications. By reading and analyzing the previous literature, it can be concluded that the types of parasomnia can be roughly divided into circadian dysrhythmia sleep disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, and restless leg syndrome. Circadian dysrhythmia sleep disorder is characterized by late sleep, insufficient or excessive sleep duration, resulting in daytime fatigue, a lack of concentration, and other symptoms. The treatment method is light therapy. The main symptom of sleep apnea is that breathing stops during sleep, resulting in a lack of oxygen supply. The treatment is to improve the maxillofacial structure through surgery to reduce the problem of dyspnea. The most obvious symptom of restless leg syndrome is discomfort and unbearable numbness in the lower legs and feet while sleeping. There are three ways to treat this condition. A more non-pharmacological treatment is to do some exercise to reduce the discomfort of the leg muscles, a medical treatment is to give the patient levodopa, and if the syndrome is caused by a lack of iron in the body, iron supplementation is sufficient.",

They were free of perinatal and postnatal complications other than apnea. During their active or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep they showed significantly more apneic episodes which were also longer lasting and they were accompanied by bradycardia of a greater severity. The organization of the immature nervous system with a preponderance of inhibitory synaptic connections and the additional inhibition of spinal motoneurons during REM sleep are likely to be the cause of apneic spells in otherwise \"normal\" preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "title": "Central Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neurophysiologically, central apnea is due to a temporary failure in the pontomedullary pacemaker generating breathing rhythm. As a polysomnographic finding, central apneas occur in many pathophysiological conditions. Depending on the cause or mechanism, central apneas may not be clinically significant, for example, those that occur normally at sleep onset. In contrast, central apneas occur in a number of disorders and result in pathophysiological consequences. Central apneas occur commonly in high‐altitude sojourn, disrupt sleep, and cause desaturation. Central sleep apnea also occurs in number of disorders across all age groups and both genders. Common causes of central sleep apnea in adults are congestive heart failure and chronic use of opioids to treat pain. Under such circumstances, diagnosis and treatment of central sleep apnea may improve quality of life, morbidity, and perhaps mortality. The mechanisms of central sleep apnea have been best studied in congestive heart failure and hypoxic conditions when there is increased CO 2 sensitivity below eupnea resulting in lowering eupneic PCO 2 below apneic threshold causing cessation of breathing until the PCO 2 rises above the apneic threshold when breathing resumes. In many other disorders, the mechanism of central sleep apnea (CSA) remains to be investigated. © 2013 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 3:141‐163, 2013.",

A thorough clinical assessment, with neuroimaging (brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of arteries and veins of the head) showed no morphological abnormalities that could cause clinical symptoms of oculomotor neuropathy. Her past history was remarkable for a similar episode of prolonged unilateral headache and oculomotor paresis about 10 years before, which were at that time considered as an acute cerebrovascular accident. Thus, two episodes of similar clinical signs of painful neuropathy, the absence of other possible causes of the disease, and the complete regression of symptoms after treatment (ibuprofen and gabapentin) confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy.",

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

      "title": "Epilepsy and sleep",
      "abstract": "This review focuses on the interrelation between clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of various epilepsy forms and level of wakefulness or sleep. In case of some epileptic syndromes seizures occur predominantly or solely in sleep. Epilepsy can modify normal sleep patterns; on the other hand, sleep influences interictal epileptiform discharges, increasing their number and changing their morphology and spreading depending on sleep stage. Although interictal discharges in focal epilepsy are more common in sleep than in wakefulness, discharge distribution in generalized epilepsy is more variable. For some epileptic syndromes there is a strong correlation between time of onset, frequency, severity of attacks and stage of sleep cycle or wakefulness. Further research in this area can shed light not only on mechanisms of epileptic networks functioning, but also on the sleep-wake cycle regulatory systems.",

Clinical presentation and recognition is crucial in considering OSA as an explanation for a group of symptoms and clinical findings. How do patients present when they have OSA? Whom do they go to for evaluation? Are there differences between genders and races? These questions will be addressed in this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an umbrella term for several chronic conditions in which partial or complete cessation of breathing occurs many times throughout the; one SDB condition in particular, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), has been globally recognized as a growing public health issue. OSAS is a chronic disease involving repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep that can cause numerous health issues if left untreated such as increased risk for hypertension, coronary heart disease, type-2 diabetes, stroke and depression. Daytime sleepiness, which can occur secondary to OSAS, impacts one’s ability to operate a motor vehicle properly and is likened to driving under the influence of alcohol. Early screening has the potential to identify OSAS and initiate subsequent treatment, which can improve breathing during sleep and decrease daytime sleepiness. The significance of early detection cannot be overlooked, as the far-reaching effects of OSAS have large public health implications.",

      "title": "The role of sleep in neuromuscular disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep represents a major frontier both in clinical myology and as a new possibility for delivering treatment to neuromuscular patients since various neuromuscular cases present a variable degree of disordered sleep and such conditions should be diagnosed and prevented, i.e., sleep apnea and hypoxemia. These sleep disorders are present in dystrophinopathies and in various types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is found in patients affected by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia but is rather common in both myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2, and the correction of sleep disorders is therefore important to improve their daily quality of life (QoL) and consequent daily functioning. Other types of sleep dysfunction such as insomnia, a reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, loss of normal REM, or sleep-disordered breathing are found in other disorders including myasthenia, ataxias, spastic paraparesis, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and neurogenic disorders, including polyneuropathies, and need appropriate treatment. Research done on this topic aims to incorporate a variety of nuances in metabolic disorders such as those in late-onset Pompe disease and are such as those in late-onset Pompe disease who are susceptible to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The overarching goal is to explore both the diagnosis and methodology of sleep-related problems in both genetic and acquired neuromuscular disorders. We also review the type of available treatment opportunities utilized to improve neuromuscular patients’ QoL.",

      "title": "Distortion of Olfactory Perception: Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinically, olfaction can fail in any of three ways: (i) decreased sensitivity (hyposmia, anosmia) and two types of distortion (dysosmia); (ii) distorted quality of an odorant stimulation (troposmia); (iii) perceived odor when no odorant is present (phantosmia, hallucination). The distortions are usually much more upsetting to a person's quality of life than a simple loss. An ipsilatersal loss of olfactory sensitivity is often identified in the nostril with any type of olfactory distortion. The pathophysiology of a stimulated distortion (troposmia) is likely a decreased number of functioning olfactory primary neurons so that an incomplete characterization of the odorant is made. In phantosmia, two possible causations include an abnormal signal or inhibition from the primary olfactory neurons or peripheral olfactory or trigeminal signals that \"trigger\" a central process. The clinician's goal is to carefully define the problem (e.g. taste versus smell, real versus perceived, one versus two nostrils), to perform the appropriate examination and testing and to provide therapy if possible. Treatment includes assurance with no active therapy (because many of these will naturally resolve), topical medications, systemic medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose and, rarely, referral for surgical excision of olfactory neurons. Endoscopic transnasal operations have the advantage of treating phantosmia and sometimes allowing a return of olfactory ability after the operation.",

      "abstract": "Continuous spike and waves during sleep is an age-related epileptic encephalopathy that presents with neurocognitive regression, seizures, and an EEG pattern of electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Patients usually present around 5 years of age with infrequent nocturnal unilateral motor seizures that progress within 1 to 2 years to a severe epileptic encephalopathy with frequent seizures of different types, marked neurocognitive regression, and an almost continuous spike-wave EEG pattern during slow-wave sleep. The pathophysiology of continuous spike and waves during sleep is not completely understood, but the corticothalamic neuronal network involved in physiologic oscillating patterns of sleep is thought to be switched into a pathologic discharging mode. Early developmental injury and/or genetic predisposition may play a role in the potentiation of age-related hyperexcitability in the immature brain. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to electrical status epilepticus during sleep may provide additional therapeutic targets that can improve the outcome of seizures, EEG pattern, and cognitive development in patients with continuous spike and waves during sleep.",

The causes of SB range from psychosocial factors to an excessive sleep arousal response. Some studies showed that SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of transient activity of the brainstem arousal. Nocturnal groaning (NG) is a parasomnia characterized by an expiratory monotonous vocalization occurring during sleep, especially in REM sleep and during the second half of the night. The pathogenesis of NG remains still unclear and many hypotheses arose, ranging from the persistence of a vestigial ventilatory pattern rather than an expiratory upper airways' obstruction. Sleep microstructure fluctuation might modulate the NG, since the end of the NG episode usually is synchronized with a cortical arousal and an autonomic activation. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiology of SB and NG, especially when the two phenomena are associated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Somnambulism is a parasomnia occurring in non-rapid eye movement sleep, and is characterized by ambulation as a disorder of arousal regulation. Sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, fragmented sleep and certain medications can increase the risk of sleep walking. Report of case(s) Here we present a 35-year-old man with multiple triggers for sleep walking, resulting in recurrent parasomnia events over fifteen years. He had a history of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic insomnia, moderate untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety with violent daytime behaviors, and prior alcohol abuse status post six years of sobriety. He was sent to our clinic due to increased frequency and severity of events, with nightly events for the last five years. Episodes were characterized by walking around the home, leaving the home, and driving on occasion. He reported at least one minor car accident as a result of sleep driving. He also reported an injury resulting from a fall in his home while sleep walking. Several security measures were implemented, including door gates, door alarms, and hiding car keys. His family slept in different bedrooms with locked doors for safety. The patient’s chronic insomnia improved with cognitive behavioral therapy, leading to an average sleep time of five hours per night with no reported hypersomnia or daytime fatigue. After his initial evaluation, he was referred for a mandibular advancement device for treatment of his OSA, due to prior poor compliance with positive airway pressure therapy related to his PTSD. Optimizing his OSA helped decrease arousals that might trigger sleep walking events. He also maintained close follow up with mental health for pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25 mg at bedtime was initiated given the severity of his somnambulism. Conclusion The use of a benzodiazepine can reduce slow wave sleep duration by its effect on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our patient had multiple risk factors for parasomnias, with severe, frequent episodes of sleepwalking leading to self-injury. His treatment involved both pharmacotherapy as well as optimization of underlying triggers. Support (if any):",

Screening for SDB is recommended before and after initiation of VNS therapy. We present a case of VNS-induced SDB which responded to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Report of case(s) A 40-year-old Caucasian female underwent a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) due to symptoms of snoring, difficulty initiating sleep, teeth grinding, vivid dreams, nightmares, excessive daytime fatigue, and sleepiness. She denied parasomnia, symptoms of narcolepsy, and restless leg syndrome. Her habitual sleep duration was 9 hours with a sleep latency of 1 hour. She had 2-3 nighttime awakenings without nocturia. Pertinent medical history included refractory focal epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, insomnia, and attention deficit disorder. Medications were eslicarbazepine 800 mg daily, topiramate 200 mg twice daily, lamotrigine 100 mg daily, trazodone 300 mg nightly, and Adderall 60 mg daily. She had a VNS implanted 5 years ago. VNS settings were frequency of 20 Hz with on and off time of 30 and 60 seconds respectively. Her body mass index was 21 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 15. HSAT showed significant periodic breathing without Cheyne stokes respiration and a 4% apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 9.6/hour. Follow-up diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) revealed periodic breathing with the respiratory events occurring during VNS on time and abnormal sleep architecture including prolonged sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) latency, increased slow wave sleep, and pseudo spindles. The respiratory events were not associated with significant sleep fragmentation or desaturation. The AHI was 6.4/hour. Respiratory events improved with CPAP 7 cmH20 during titration PSG. She will be followed up in the sleep clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP therapy. Conclusion There is a complex relationship between epilepsy and SDB. Antiepileptics and VNS can cause new onset or worsening SDB. Management options for VNS-induced SDB include PAP therapy, changing VNS settings, or alternate therapies for refractory epilepsy. A multimodal approach requiring input from the patient, a sleep specialist, and an epileptologist is recommended for optimal results. Support (if any)",

In obstructive sleep apnoea, also known as the obstructive sleep apnoea–hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS), the cause is not from the CNS but from a physical obstruction to breathing. The obstruction can be an anatomical abnormality in the upper airway—for example, enlarged tonsils. Obesity, being male, advanced age and hypertension are all associated with OSAHS. The obstruction site is usually in the collapsible portions of the pharynx: the velopharynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx. Sleeping patients can overcome the obstruction by increasingly forceful inspiration which eventually creates enough inspiratory pressure to re-open the occluded airway. However, this crescendo respiratory pattern disrupts NREM/REM sleep causing daytime sleepiness and fatigue. OSAHS also causes an increased afterload in both ventricles of the heart, decreased left ventricular compliance, increased pulmonary artery pressure, decreased coronary blood flow and increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Taken together, these abnormalities predispose patients to develop cardiovascular disease. Whether patients with CMT1A with sleep apnoea …",

Treatment of PLM using Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine with hypnotic properties, markedly reduced the sleep fragmentation due to PLM and, despite its depressant properties on the central nervous system, controlled the repetitive central apnoeas. These two observations, although rare, give insight into the role of non-ventilatory variables in the development of sleep apnoea.

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital function to all species for reinvigorating the mental and physical senses. During sleep, specific synapses become less active to eliminate unneeded memories as other synapses strengthen to enhance memory consolidation. Healthy quality and longevity of sleep can also regulate moods by ridding fatigue and repairing integrity of the medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connections. External disturbances affect the quality of sleep, and an individual's routine may play a role in the development of sleeping disorders. By irregulating the circadian rhythm and having consistent negative sleeping habits, sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea may develop. Eight to nine hours of sleep are recommended to both teenagers and adults, if less is received, difficulty in concentration and interpretation of information may be present, as well as physiological effects such as higher blood pressure caused by the disrupted regulation of stress hormones, which if continued, can make the body more prone to serious health conditions.The science of sleep and dreaming comprises a relevant thesis in modern neuroscience research and issues major comprehensions on the study of human consciousness. Dreams are an integral part of sleep. Sleep and dream cycles vary in phenomenology, characteristics, and under circumstances, interpretation of the individual. Various theories such as Sigmun Freud's Psychodynamic theory, the activation synthesis model, and the cognitive development theory have been created and numerous studies are ongoing as the principal motive of dreams has not yet been concluded. Some theories remain heavily physiological as high difficulty of investigations are discontinued by scientists and deemed unverifiable. The research presented here revolves around the neurology of sleep as to inquire into the physiology and investigations on the purpose of dreams. We thus conclude the current review with a call for further research directed towards the primary purpose of sleep and dream.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular Consequences of Disordered Sleep",
      "abstract": "Sleep is an important component of every clinician's health assessment. Common sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic insomnia) have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system when left untreated. In this column, we discuss sleep/cardiovascular neurobiology and highlight the impact of nurse-led programs for improving patients' sleep and cardiovascular health. To reduce cardiovascular disease risk, people generally require 6 or more hours of uninterrupted sleep,1 which is composed of 2 types: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep.2 Non-REM sleep can be further divided into 3 substages (N1, N2, and N3) that reflect the lightest (N1) to deepest (N3) sleep. Sleep types/stages are quantified when a patient undergoes polysomnography, which records electrical activity in the cortex, measures cardiorespiratory parameters (eg, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), and calculates diagnostic indices (eg, sleep apnea index). Sleep stages are defined by their distinctive electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns.2–4 Sleep normally begins with the N1 stage when cortical neurons begin producing a synchronous EEG rhythm. The transition from N1 to N2 sleep follows as the EEG rhythm shifts toward a lower-frequency pattern that is interspersed with 2 distinctive types of high-amplitude EEG waves (sleep spindles and K complexes). The deepest stage of sleep (N3) follows—slow (0.5–4 Hz), high-amplitude, synchronized EEG waves characterize N3 sleep (the slow neural oscillations are called delta waves; N3 sleep is also called \"slow-wave sleep\").2–5 Short bouts of REM sleep normally alternate with longer periods of non-REM sleep. The REM sleep EEG is distinctly different from the signals observed during non-REM sleep.3 Similar to the EEG during wakefulness, the EEG rhythm is fast and desynchronized during REM sleep—REM sleep is associated with vivid dreaming, rapid movements of the eyes, and muscle atonia.2 The role of REM sleep in cardiovascular homeostasis is incompletely understood, although anatomical brain research has revealed how REM-sleep regulatory centers in the brainstem (pontine tegmentum) send projections to medullary regions that control sympathetic output (rostral ventrolateral medulla), suggesting that REM sleep may be important in regulating the sympathetic innervation of the heart and blood vessels.3,6 Non-REM sleep also has important implications for cardiovascular health—sympathetic outflow declines during sustained periods of non-REM sleep. When asleep, a patient's blood pressure should drop significantly, a phenomenon called \"blood pressure dipping.\" Nondipping (the failure to produce a reduction in blood pressure by ~10% during sleep) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity.3 Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are examples of prevalent sleep disorders with detrimental cardiovascular effects—these conditions can fragment/reduce sleep (particularly the N3 and REM sleep stages) and impair blood pressure dipping.3,7 Prevalence estimates for insomnia range from 5% to 50% in the general population, whereas obstructive sleep apnea afflicts 3% to 53% of adults, with higher rates associated with men, older age, and obesity.7–10 Nurse-led programs have been important for understanding, treating, and preventing sleep disorders and their cardiovascular consequences. For example, Siebmanns et al11 and Kapella et al12 treated insomnia by developing cognitive behavioral therapy programs for patients with cardiac and pulmonary disorders, respectively. Both programs significantly improved patient-reported and objective sleep quality indicators. Urcan and Kolcu13 developed an educational program for patients to improve their sleep after experiencing a stroke, and Zhu et al14 found that indicators of poor sleep quality (eg, number of awakenings) were significantly associated with poorer glycemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes. To understand adherence to sleep apnea therapies, Sawyer et al15,16 studied the factors affecting patients' use of positive airway pressure ventilation, finding that the facilitators, barriers, and perceptions varied across patients—this knowledge could be used to tailor nurses' future interventions toward sleep apnea management. In fact, nurse-led interventions have been successful in improving continuous positive airway pressure adherence. Nurses also examined sleep in hospital settings and provided recommendations to enhance patients' abilities to sleep in intensive care units, where lighting and noise can be particularly disruptive.17–21 In summary, healthy sleep is critical for cardiovascular health. Nurses have been designing, testing, and implementing novel approaches toward improving sleep. Nurses' research, practice, teaching, and policy initiatives about sleep are vital components of the national/global strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.",

In this proposal we emphasize the need to clearly define each of these alterations/loss of consciousness and to apply this terminology in semiologic descriptions and classifications of epileptic seizures. The proposal is a consensus opinion of experienced epileptologists, and it is hoped that it will lead to systematic studies that will allow a scientific characterization of the different types of alterations/loss of consciousness described in this article.",

On the other hand, alterations of nocturnal sleep have been widely described in affective disorders, but little is known about the presence of daytime sleep in depressed patients and the possible effect of daytime sleep episodes on nocturnal sleep. Some attempts to characterize daytime sleep in depression are reviewed. A recent study based on continuous polygraphic recordings indicate that napping occurrence appears to be similar in depressed patients than in control subjects. However, naps structure and organization were different in depressed patients in comparison to controls. Napping seems thus to be more prevalent in depressed patients than previously assumed. Possible effects of naps on mood, alertness in depressed patients remains to be explored.",

      "abstract": "Although sleep-related problems are a frequent finding in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), the aetiology is still unknown. We examined the associations between disease severity, sleep-related problems and social status in 116 PD patients participating in the FAQT Study, a prospective, German cohort study evaluating determinants of quality of life in PD patients. 47.4% of the patients reported sleep onset difficulties, 26.7% sleep interruptions, 14.7% had five or more sleep-related events during the night and 71.6% showed symptoms of increased daytime somnolence. The disease severity was significantly associated with sleep-related events (p = 0.01), the depression score with sleep onset difficulties (p = 0.04), sleep interruptions (p = 0.01) and the levodopa dose (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that depressive symptoms and increasing levodopa doses in PD patients mainly cause sleep onset difficulties and sleep interruptions, while the severity of motor symptoms contributes to sleep-related events like sleep walking, heavy sweating and nightmares.",

Respiratory dysfunction in sleep is common in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring at a significantly higher rate than in the general population. Regulation of sleep is mediated by opposing actions of the anterior and posterior/lateral regions of the hypothalamus. Insomnia is characterized as difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, awakening in morning, or non-restorative sleep. The negative effects of shift work include sleepiness and insomnia, reduced alertness, and greater risk of re-injury, overall poor health, low work productivity, and poor quality of life. The sleep diary has been used in the TBI population for assessing sleep quality and quantity, and for identifying factors that may affect sleep and wakefulness. Sleep in TBI represents something of a challenge to investigate because of the broad array of possible diagnoses for the manifested problems.",

      "abstract": "Much anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation not only impairs performance, but also brings about other extraordinary effects like hallucinations. However, knowledge about how sleep deprivation may trigger hallucinations is limited. To qualitatively describe hallucinatory experiences during sleep deprivation 12 male military officers from the Norwegian Armed Forces who all had experienced at least one sleep loss-induced hallucinatory experience were recruited. Data were collected and analyzed by semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This resulted in the identification of three distinct main themes: (1) Modalities, (2) circumstances/triggers and (3) reactions to hallucinations. Hallucinations were experienced in several modalities (visual, auditory and multi-modality), although visual hallucinations seemed to dominate. Typical reported circumstances/triggers were sleep loss, physical exhaustion, time-of-day, low calorie intake, mental exhaustion and lack of external stimuli (low sensory and social input, boring situations, and monotonous activity). Negative emotions were dominant during the hallucinatory episodes. Often some reasoning and checking on behalf of the officers were necessary to differentiate between real percepts and hallucinations. In some cases the hallucinations caused erroneous actions. Retrospectively, most officers viewed their hallucinatory experiences in light of positive emotions and several emphasized having learned something from them. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and suggestions for future studies are outlined.",

Polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides impaired sleep continuity, sleep in depression is characterized by a reduction of slow wave sleep and a disinhibition of random eye movement (REM) sleep, with a shortening of REM latency, a prolongation of the first REM period and increased REM density.Our own experimental work has focused on the reciprocal interaction hypothesis of non-REM and REM sleep regulation as a model to explain the characteristic features of depressed sleep.In agreement with the major tenet of this model, administration of cholinomimetics provoked shortened REM latency in healthy subjects and led to an even stronger REM sleep disinhibition in depressed patients. Manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle, such as sleep deprivation or a phase advance of the sleep period, alleviate depressive symptoms.These data indicate a strong bidirectional relationship between sleep, sleep alterations and depression.",

      "title": "A Chronic Canine Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep (1-3). Upper airway closure results in reduction or cessation of breathing, leading to progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia and increasing inspiratory efforts against the occluded airway. These stimuli ultimately provoke arousal from sleep, which leads to restoration of upper airway patency and resumption of breathing. An increasing body of clinical and epidemiological literature indicates that the sleep fragmentation and recurrent hypoxemia associated with OSA lead to a host of important neuropsychological, cardiovascular, respiratory control, and other disturbances, which in turn result in substantial morbidity and mortality (3-5). However, the investigation of the mechanisms by which these complications are produced has been hampered by the methodologic restrictions inherent to investigations involving humans, and by the fact that once the human condition comes to clinical attention, it has typically been present for some time. It is therefore difficult to determine which abnormalities represent a primaryfactor contributing to the disorder, a secondary complication of it, or an indirectly associated comorbidity.",

It is a state of rest for the otherwise active nervous system. It is dened as a state of unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by appropriate sensory or any other stimulus (1). Sleep duration varies with gender, age and also according to one's daily routine. A lack of sleep, or sleep deprivation (SD), is a widespread phenomenon that can induce adverse changes in cognitive performance. Sleep duration is very important but sleep quality is often ignored factor. Sleep is very essential for learning, memory, attention, alertness, judgement, and overall health of an individual.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by frequent interruptions in breathing during sleep, usually accompanied by snoring. Currently, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is diagnosed using polysomnography, a method of recording body activity during sleep and pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood at any time. Obstructive sleep apnea itself is not a life-threatening condition, but it can cause serious problems such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Sleep apnea during the day can make a person feel excessively sleepy, have difficulty concentrating, or headaches. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were used for the study. Signals are taken from the CAP Sleep database [1]. Sleep apnea has been associated with disorders such as narcolepsy, bruxism, periodic limb movement syndrome, sleep apnea, and nocturnal frontal frontal lobe epilepsy. It should be noted that these disorders are found in different sections of the ICSD-3 classification. The paper investigates entropy methods and the calculation of the highest Lyapunov exponent in relation to the problem of recognizing sleep apnea by EEG. The developed algorithms and programs are intended for medical computer systems and implemented in the MATLAB software environment.",

      "abstract": "Wearable sleep-tracking technology is of growing use in the sleep and circadian fields, including for applications across other disciplines, inclusive of a variety of disease states. Patients increasingly present sleep data derived from their wearable devices to their providers and the ever-increasing availability of commercial devices and new-generation research/clinical tools has led to the wide adoption of wearables in research, which has become even more relevant given the discontinuation of the Philips Respironics Actiwatch. Standards for evaluating the performance of wearable sleep-tracking devices have been introduced and the available evidence suggests that consumer-grade devices exceed the performance of traditional actigraphy in assessing sleep as defined by polysomnogram. However, clear limitations exist, for example, the misclassification of wakefulness during the sleep period, problems with sleep tracking outside of the main sleep bout or nighttime period, artifacts, and unclear translation of performance to individuals with certain characteristics or comorbidities. This is of particular relevance when person-specific factors (like skin color or obesity) negatively impact sensor performance with the potential downstream impact of augmenting already existing healthcare disparities. However, wearable sleep-tracking technology holds great promise for our field, given features distinct from traditional actigraphy such as measurement of autonomic parameters, estimation of circadian features, and the potential to integrate other self-reported, objective, and passively recorded health indicators. Scientists face numerous decision points and barriers when incorporating traditional actigraphy, consumer-grade multi-sensor devices, or contemporary research/clinical-grade sleep trackers into their research. Considerations include wearable device capabilities and performance, target population and goals of the study, wearable device outputs and availability of raw and aggregate data, and data extraction, processing, and analysis. Given the difficulties in the implementation and utilization of wearable sleep-tracking technology in real-world research and clinical settings, the following State of the Science review requested by the Sleep Research Society aims to address the following questions. What data can wearable sleep-tracking devices provide? How accurate are these data? What should be taken into account when incorporating wearable sleep-tracking devices into research? These outstanding questions and surrounding considerations motivated this work, outlining practical recommendations for using wearable technology in sleep and circadian research.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

A problem oriented meticulous history can give valuable insights and distinct diagnostic considerations form the basis for an eventually successful therapeutic approach.

Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Rationale: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a human prion disease that is characterized by sleep-wake cycle deterioration, loss of slow-wave sleep, and motor overactivation over the daily 24-hour period. Patient concerns: Here, we report the case of a 57-year-old man who had an irregular sleep-wake cycle and exhibited frequent movements and vocalizations during sleep. Diagnoses: Video-polysomnography showed disrupted sleep structure, rapid alternation between sleep stages, and an absence of sleep spindles and slow-wave sleep. Moreover, body movements persisted throughout the entire sleep period, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The atonia index was very low (<0.025) during REM sleep. Genetic testing revealed a prion protein gene mutation at codon 178, and the patient was diagnosed with FFI. Interventions: We tried to treat with amantadine, doxycycline, and immunotherapies, but the disease progressed. Outcomes: Sleep disturbance is the most frequent and essential symptom of FFI. Lessons: FFI is difficult to diagnose due to the low sensitivity of diagnostic tools. Diagnoses can be further supported by better knowledge of typical polysomnographic findings.",

EMG investigation of laryngeal muscle activity was subsequently performed during wakefulness and sleep, placing fine-wire electrodes in the posterior cricoarytenoid, cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles. The specialist made a diagnosis of nocturnal inspiratory stridor based on the characteristics of the noise present only during sleep, particularly during NREM sleep. A diagnosis of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was also made due to the characteristic clinical history of violent motor behaviors during sleep associated with polysomnography (PSG) evidence of REM sleep without atonia. Tracheostomy and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are effective treatments of stridor; however, they do not always prevent death in multiple-system atrophy.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between depression and insomnia is complex - particularly for the patient. Most people suffering from poor sleep, even if only for a few nights, present with depressive-like symptoms but are generally not happy if they're told that poor sleep is merely a symptom of depression. Patients will often deny having depression even when there are clear symptoms and blame these on the lack of sleep. So is poor sleep always a symptom of depression?",

      "title": "Febrile Seizures and Febrile Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Febrile seizures (FS) are nosological entities that affect 2–5% of children aged 6 months to 5 years. In most cases, these seizures are isolated or sporadic; they are defined as simple febrile seizures. However, a febrile seizure that lasts more than 15 min, which has focal signs, or that recurs within 24 h is defined as \"complex\" febrile seizure. Prolonged febrile seizure (PFS) is therefore a particular type of complex febrile seizure. In case the duration exceeds 30 min, the more appropriate definition is febrile status epilepticus (FSE). Electroencephalogram (EEG) is not indicated in the routine evaluation of simple febrile seizures; on the other hand, the role of EEG in children with complex febrile seizures including febrile status epilepticus is not well-known. The acute EEG findings after prolonged febrile seizures reveal abnormal activity in at least one third of cases across different series. Epileptiform discharges might be seen in patients with febrile status epilepticus in a small portion of patients. It is possible that the occurrence of spikes indicates a genetic susceptibility. The long-term value of the early EEG findings after prolonged febrile seizures is not yet known, but the data so far suggest that the focal slowing is not associated with pre-existing focal structural lesions since it is only present for a short period of time.",

Other sensory stimuli did not elicit an attack. Clinical evidence of diffuse brain damage from birth was present in all of them. The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges. They occurred before, synchronous with, or after the myoclonus. A defective descending inhibitory system may lead to development of both the EEG discharges and the myoclonus in response to a peripheral sensory stimulus.",

Sleep latency was significantly longer in the depressive groups. The nonendogenous depressive patients exhibited significantly more awake time and lower sleep efficiency during the sleep period. No significant group differences were found for first rapid eye movement (REM) period latency, REM density, or any other REM sleep measures. Age correlated significantly with REM latency and delta sleep time, especially among depressive patients. No significant correlations between sleep measures and severity of illness were found. It appears that the classic REM sleep findings associated with the adult depressive syndrome are not present among depressive adolescents, indicating a later ontogeny for these abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Visual hallucinations are one of the prominent symptoms of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). These hallucinations are often vivid and bothersome to patients. There is limited literature regarding patients with DLB presenting with hypnopompic/hypnagogic hallucinations as the initial chief complaint. We report a case of a 77 year old female patient presenting to sleep medicine clinic with history of newer onset sleep-related hallucinations as well as concerns for sleep-disordered breathing, but was subsequently diagnosed with DLB. Report of Case 77 year old female patient initially presented to PCP with a one year history of disturbing hallucinations while falling asleep. Additionally, patient had excessive daytime sleepiness along with family history significant for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Given the concerns of parasomnias and OSA, patient was referred to Sleep Medicine clinic. On presentation, patient continued to have hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations along with symptoms concerning for OSA. An in-lab polysomnogram (PSG) was performed, which demonstrated evidence of a moderate to severe degree of OSA. Patient reported hypnopompic hallucination on the night of PSG. CPAP therapy was initiated. Despite treatment, her sleep-related hallucinations continued. She also began to have daytime hallucinations as well as cognitive impairment. Due to progression of symptoms despite treatment of OSA, neurology consultation was recommended. Per neurology evaluation, patient received PET CT metabolites which demonstrated changes consistent with DLB. Conclusion DLB should be considered as one of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations especially if the patient has other signs of dementia.",

Nurses working permanent night shifts may have major disturbances in their daytime sleep especially in the duration of sleep which is much less than that of night sleep, and this may be due to attending to essential daytime necessities (e.g. cooking, feeding, shopping and spending time with family). Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2]. Nurses working permanent night shifts frequently lament about problems in commencing and/or sustaining sleep, as well as a decline in sleep duration [3].

Like the Greeks, we continue to be fascinated with sleep, with dreams, and with death. Even today children may recite the prayer: Now I lay me down to sleep ... If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Adults spend about one third of their lives in sleep. Children spend a larger proportion of their lives asleep than adults, and may experience a variety of childhood sleep disorders that can disrupt that sleep. In fact, sleep disorders are among the most common problems encountered by primary care physi­ cians who see and treat young children. This is because these disorders affect the child and the parents, at night and also the following day. Both the child and the parents may suffer from fatigue and irritability for days after a night of decreased sleep, but it is usually the parent who suffers more since it is easier for the young child to catch up on sleep during the day. Young children rarely complain of sleep dis­ orders; it is the parents who express the con­ cern.",

      "title": "<scp>REM</scp> Sleep Behavior Disorder and Visual Hallucinations in a Pathologically Confirmed Case of Corticobasal Degeneration",
      "abstract": "In autopsy series of patients with parkinsonism, the presence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) or visual hallucinations (VH) has a greater than 90% specificity for α-synuclein pathology.1, 2 Accordingly, these clinical features are often useful when considering the differential diagnosis of atypical parkinsonsim. We report an unusual case of autopsy confirmed corticobasal degeneration (CBD) with clinical evidence of both RBD and VH in the absence of co-existing α-synuclein pathology. The patient was 74 when he presented with a 12-month history of feeling generally slow and unsteady. He had difficulty getting out of bed and getting into and out of his car. He stopped driving because he realized that he was unable to react quickly enough and his wife reported that he was becoming forgetful. He had difficulty getting to sleep and had also developed constipation. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy and osteoarthrosis of his knees. His medications were metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, perindopril and simvastatin. He was a retired engineer who had never smoked tobacco and who drank little alcohol. There was no relevant family history. On examination, he had hypomimia and reduced blink rate. He walked slowly with a stooped posture and no arm swing. There was bilateral bradykinesia and some rigidity but no tremor. Brain MRI was normal apart from mild small vessel disease. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-benserazide was started, escalating to 25/100 mg three times daily. At follow-up three months later he noted an improvement in performing daily tasks and cognition. Over the next six months he started to cough and splutter while eating and drinking and his balance worsened, particularly when changing direction. He deteriorated quickly, developing a shuffling gait, difficulty rising from a seated position, and began to topple backwards leading to falls. He had a \"rigid stare\" with slightly reduced vertical eye movements, and was incontinent of urine and feces. There was no further benefit from higher doses of levodopa-benserazide and his overall levodopa responsiveness was considered poor. The clinical diagnosis was revised to progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome. He was evaluated at another hospital three years after his symptoms began. His daily levodopa intake was 600 mg and he required a wheelchair. He was sleeping 6–7 hours with bad dreams, during which he would shout out and have violent limb movements, particularly in the latter part of the night. Visual hallucinations (VH) in which he saw family members were also reported. Examination revealed complete loss of up-gaze, slowness of finger movements without decrement, and generalized limb and axial rigidity. His dose of levodopa was reduced but there is no record of his VH improving. He moved to nursing home care and died age 78 following a lower respiratory tract infection. The disease duration from symptom onset was approximately 4.5 years. On neuropathological examination, there was no evidence of α-synucleinopathy or TDP43 proteinopathy in the brainstem, amygdalae, hippocampi or neocortical regions. Instead, histological examination revealed primary tauopathy with both glial and neuronal inclusions. Neuronal pathology was in the form of neuropil threads, pre-tangles and tangles and the hallmark glial tau pathology was that of astrocytic plaques, confirming the diagnosis of CBD (see Fig. 1). CBD pathology and atrophy were most prominent in the frontal lobe, deep gray nuclei and midbrain. Occasional grains were also noted in the medial temporal lobes and Braak and Braak neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology did not exceed stage II. Aβ pathology was restricted to diffuse deposits in the neocortex and there was also a cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the cerebral and cerebellar leptomeninges and cerebral cortex. VH were recorded in just 5 of 67 patients with autopsy confirmed CBD from three clinicopathological series.1, 3, 4 Concomitant VH and RBD have previously been described in a patient with CBD, however there was co-existing brainstem Lewy body pathology that may have accounted for these features.5 There has been one further report of RBD in a patient with confirmed CBD; this patient also had parkinsonism and a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy but details of other misfolded protein pathology were not included.6 The limitations of this report include the absence of polysomnography to confirm the clinical diagnosis of probable RBD and the possibility that levodopa may have provoked the patient's VH and RBD. Nonetheless, the absence of α-synuclein pathology at autopsy suggests that topographical differences in pathology are more likely responsible, rather than pathophysiological changes specific to misfolded α-synuclein. Recent work implicating changes in brain network connectivity in the pathogenesis of VH7 may explain why several heterogenous regions are associated with VH, such as the brainstem, amygdalae and neocortical areas.8, 9 Complex networks also facilitate REM sleep atonia and involve various brainstem nuclei.10 As such, CBD tau pathology observed in the neocortex and midbrain structures may account for these features in this case.

      "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and epilepsy seems reciprocal, as comorbid sleep disorders are more frequent in patients with epilepsy, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with refractory epilepsy, which may aggravate seizure burden, while treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) often improves seizure frequency and insomnia. Differentiating nocturnal seizures from primary sleep disorders is essential for determining appropriate therapy and recognizing coexistent sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy may improve their seizure burden and quality of life (QOL). Sleep clearly influences the expression of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and epileptic seizures. Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) or benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common and most characteristic form of idiopathic focal epilepsy of childhood. Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) polysomnography combines the seizure-localizing properties of video-EEG monitoring with polysomnography and allows for confident specific diagnosis in most instances where clinical history is inconclusive.",

      "title": "1501 Sleepy Teens: A Case Series of Diagnostic Dilemmas in Pathological Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Central disorders for hypersomnolence (CDH) consist of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), narcolepsy type 1 and type 2. These are difficult to differentiate due to confounding social issues and mood disorders commonly encountered in pediatric clinical settings, which may contribute to the delay in diagnosis. These diagnostic dilemmas arise in patients who have significant sleepiness, but do not meet diagnostic criteria. Here, a case series of five patients with EDS, and their confounders will be presented. Report of case An eleven-year-old early teen with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of 17, who has undergone polysomnograms (PSG) and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) demonstrating 1-2 sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMP), and mean sleep-onset latency (MSL) of 8.7 minutes and 9 minutes. Genetic testing and cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels were normal. A twenty-year-old (ESS 13) with unrefreshing naps without cataplexy, underwent a PSG/MSLT demonstrating 3 SOREMPs and MSL of 3.3 minutes while on sertraline and trazodone, but 6.3 hours of sleep and AHI of 3.0/hr with normal genetic testing and orexin levels. An eighteen-year-old with hypersomnia (ESS 16) and snoring had no SOREMPs, but an MSL of 7.5 minutes and normal orexin levels with an AHI of 3.9/hr, while an eighteen-year-old with ESS of 20, cataplexy and hypnogogic hallucinations had no SOREMPs and an MSL of 14.3 minutes. Lastly, a 21-year-old with sleep paralysis had no SOREMPs and an MSL of 9.5 minutes on fluoxetine, with 1% REM sleep and 83.5% N3 sleep on the prior PSG. Sleep diaries had no significant findings. Each of these patients had confounding variables (Table 1). These patients all received trials of wake-promoting agents or stimulants with varying degrees of success. Conclusion These cases represent the challenges encountered in the children due to numerous confounders in EDS, and not meeting criteria for CDH. This is frustrating for both families and providers as they may or may not progress to narcolepsy or IH with time, hence, contributing to the problem of delays in diagnosis of CDH and treatment. Further studies and guidelines specific to children are needed to re-define CDH accounting for the variability in the presentation. Support (if any)",

      "title": "1231 Slurred Speech- Unusual Presentation of Cataplexy in Childhood Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, frequently presents in late childhood/early adolescence. Cataplexy, the most specific symptom, presents as transient loss of muscle tone causing weakness. Approximately 80% of children with narcolepsy present with cataplexy1. Report of Case Eight year old African American boy presented to sleep clinic with concerns for excessive daytime sleepiness and slurred speech. Teachers initially referred to speech therapy because of slurred speech. There, speech got noticeably worse with frustration. Subsequently, sleepiness developed, and his pediatrician referred him for polysomnogram (PSG) and Mean Sleep Latency test (MSLT). After unremarkable PSG, MSLT demonstrated mean sleep latency of 10 minutes with no SOREM sleep. Patient came for evaluation in Sleep Medicine clinic where family reported worsening speech with extreme emotions and profound sleepiness, Epworth of 20. Because of the presentation and lack of REM sleep on MSLT, brain MRI was ordered and was normal. HLA typing for narcolepsy positively showed HLA haplotype associated with narcolepsy. Patient was diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy and started on Modafinil 50 mg. Modafinil was progressively increased to 200 mg in a.m. and 100 mg at noon. To address cataplexy symptoms, he started Venlafaxine 12.5 mg and increased to 25 mg. Epworth score improved on Modafinil, his cataplexy symptoms, including speech difficulties, subsided on Venlafaxine. Patient’s communication improved, as did school performance and social life, and patient is currently thriving in 10th grade. Current Epworth is 5 and current medications include Modafinil 200 mg in the morning, 100 mg at noon and Venlaflaxine 25 mg at night. Conclusion This case report highlights the importance of recognizing unusual presentations of cataplexy and the impact of treatment. These symptoms can be easily missed and erroneously attributed to developmental delay or behavioral issues.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic chronic sleep onset insomnia (SOI) in children with Attention‐Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) shows typical characteristics of the delayed sleep phase syndrome and could, therefore, be considered a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism of the clock gene PER3 is associated with the delayed sleep phase syndrome and, hence, may associate with ADHD-related chronic SOI as well. Here, we investigated an association between ADHD-related chronic SOI and the VNTR polymorphism of PER3 in 10 medication naïve children with rigorously diagnosed ADHD and SOI (ADHD-SOI), and in 10 normal controls. Actigraphic sleep onset and sleep duration and salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) were evaluated in ADHD-SOI. The 4-repeat allele frequency was lower in ADHD-SOI (0.65) than in normal controls (0.75) (p = 0.73) with an odds ratio of 0.62 (CI 0.16 – 2.4). In ADHD-SOI, mean (±SD) DLMO (21:38 ± 0:50 h), sleep onset (22:17 ± 0:46 h), and sleep duration (9:26 ± 0:41 h) were not significantly related to the 4-repeat allele frequency. The present findings suggest no association between ADHD-related idiopathic chronic sleep onset insomnia and the PER3 VNTR polymorphism.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is characterized by the involuntary discharge of urine at night in those 5 years of age or older. Primary NE (PNE) is diagnosed in an individual who has never achieved nighttime dryness; in secondary NE (SNE), incontinence follows a dry period of at least 6 months. In either, the enuresis must not be due exclusively to a medical condition or diuretic therapy. Prevalence is estimated at 5% to 10% among 5-year-olds, 3% to 5% among 10-year-olds, and 1% among those 15 years of age and older. Between 5% and 10% of cases resolve annually without treatment. (1) The causes of PNE and SNE remain unclear, although physical, neurologic, and psychological factors; genetics; sleep structure; and other medical conditions have been implicated. (2)Treatment for NE includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options, and many families are interested in complementary and integrative approaches. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback in treating NE.Originally developed as a health-care tool in China thousands of years ago, the stimulation of specific points on the body (called acupoints) may be carried out by a variety of techniques, including insertion of thin needles (acupuncture), surface pressure (acupressure), electricity (electro-acupuncture), and laser (laser acupuncture). The effect of acupuncture on PNE was assessed through two recent systematic reviews. (3)(4) The Cochrane review summarized the results of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (5)(6)(7)In the first study, 111 patients ages 5 to 15 years were assigned randomly to two different forms of acupuncture. (5) In the treatment group, a needle was embedded under the skin and left in place; in the control group, a needle was placed on the skin surface for 30 minutes each day. The number of treatment courses (of 6 days each) depended on response; follow-up times were not reported. At the end of the study, 54% (30/56) of patients in the treatment group attained 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 31% (17/55) in the control group. Adverse events were not mentioned.In the second study, 100 patients were assigned to two groups: 80 to the acupuncture group and 20 to the drug group. (6) Patient ages were reported only for the acupuncture group, with most patients between 5 and 21 years of age. In this group, patients received needle acupuncture daily for 10 days. In the drug group, patients received a combination of drugs: meclofenoxate (200 mg four times a day), oryzanol (20 mg three times a day), and thiamine (25 mg three times a day) for 10 days. The number of treatment courses (of 10 days each) varied. At the end of the study, 73% (58/80) of patients in the acupuncture group reached 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 10% (2/20) in the drug group. Adverse events were not mentioned. The conclusions from this study are limited because reporting of methods and patient demographics were incomplete.In the third study, 40 patients ages 5 to 16 years were assigned randomly to laser acupuncture or pharmacotherapy for 3 months. (7) In the acupuncture group, patients received laser acupuncture (for 30 seconds three times per week to a maximum of 15 treatments). In the drug group, patients received intranasal desmopressin (between 20 and 40 mcg, as needed). Response was defined as a decrease in wet nights of 90%, partial response as a decrease of 50%, and nonresponse as a decrease of less than 50%. At the end of the study, response was reported to be 80% (16/20) for the acupuncture group and 70% (14/20) for the drug group. A similar level of response was reported 6 months after the study. No adverse events occurred in either group. The conclusions from this study are limited because of the small sample size and subsequent lack of statistical power.A second systematic review identified 10 additional studies that compared acupuncture with either a different form of acupuncture or another traditional Chinese medicine therapy such as herbs. (4) Few study details were provided in the review. The authors concluded that although there was tentative evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in NE, the quality of the included studies was very low. Because of the types of comparison groups used, the usefulness of the studies in the context of Western medicine is limited.One additional RCT compared acupressure with oxybutynin therapy in 24 patients ages 4 to 13 years. (8) Three patients had experienced unsuccessful pharmacologic treatments previously and were assigned to receive acupressure. The acupressure group received daily acupressure from their parents; the other group received 0.4 mg/kg of oxybutynin daily. Response was classified as complete, partial (reduction in bedwetting), or none and was scored by the parents at the following time points: 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the start of treatment. The authors reported that although there was no statistically significant difference between groups at any time point, the values for complete response were consistently higher for the acupressure group. The complete response rate at each time point was reported as 25%, 58%, 75%, and 83% for acupressure and 8%, 25%, 50%, and 58% for oxybutynin. No adverse events were reported. The conclusions from this study are limited because of the small sample size and because three patients were assigned directly to the acupressure group.We were unable to combine data from any of these studies because of the variability in treatments and controls used. Overall, acupuncture and acupressure appear promising, but the scientific and clinical relevance of these studies is limited due to the methodologic points identified for each. To strengthen the evidence of the utility of acupuncture in treating PNE, studies must be conducted with increased methodologic rigor and verified by replication. Additional comparative effectiveness research would help clarify the optimal role of acupuncture in the context of Western conventional care. No adverse events were reported.The use of hypnosis for PNE was summarized in a recent Cochrane systematic review that presented the results of two studies, an RCT and a controlled clinical trial. (3) In the RCT, 48 boys ages 8 to 13 years were assigned randomly to one of four groups: trance plus suggestions (group A), suggestions without trance (group B), trance alone (group C), and wait list (group D). (9) Groups A, B, and C received 1-hour sessions each week for 6 weeks. The mean number of dry nights after the trial were higher for these groups than for group D. Improvements were observed after 6 months for groups A, B, and C but not for group D; however, the study authors reported that only groups A and B showed significant improvement and that the effect may have been due to the suggestions rather than to the hypnosis. The conclusions for this study are limited because of small sample size and incomplete reporting of methods and results. In addition, the four groups differed with respect to number of dry nights at baseline.In the controlled clinical trial, 50 patients ages 5 to 16 years were assigned alternately to hypnosis or imipramine therapy for 3 months. (10) Patients in the hypnosis group received two 30-minute sessions in week 1, one session in week 2, then sessions every 1 to 2 weeks. The imipramine patients received 25 mg each night, which was increased weekly if there was no response. The number of patients who were dry or improved at 3 months was similar between groups (18/25 for hypnosis compared with 19/25 for imipramine). However, after treatment ended, many more patients relapsed who received imipramine than hypnosis (13/19 versus 1/18).In one additional RCT, 89 patients ages 7 to 12 years who had PNE were randomized to either hypnosis or alarms. (11) Patients in the hypnosis group received an audiotape for use at bedtime until they were dry. Patients in the alarm group received instruction on using an alarm. A successful outcome was achieved by 19% of the hypnosis group compared with 55% of the alarm group. Relapse was experienced by two hypnosis and six alarm patients.As for the acupuncture studies, methodologic variation prevented the combining of data for analysis. Studies that have increased methodologic rigor would strengthen the evidence of hypnosis for PNE, as would replication of results. No adverse events were reported.To our knowledge, the use of biofeedback in NE has not been investigated through controlled clinical trials. We present the results from six prospective observational studies that specifically reported on the effect of biofeedback on NE of various causes (Table). The types of biofeedback used in these studies fall into two categories. In the first category (type I), voiding muscles are monitored with perianal electrodes. Children who have full bladders practice voiding control exercises and receive feedback of muscle activity on a visual display. The specific exercises generally consist of a series of muscle contractions to allow patients to understand how to relax their pelvic floor musculature and external urethral sphincter to help with coordinated voiding. Four studies used type I biofeedback in children who had voiding dysfunction alone (12)(13) or who had vesicoureteral reflux (14) or vesical voluntary sphincter/pelvic floor dyssynergia. (15) Results for all studies were positive, resulting in most patients being cured or improving.The second category of biofeedback (type II) is characterized by repeated cycles of bladder filling and voiding. A catheter is inserted into the bladder and used to fill the bladder with liquid, after which the patient practices controlled voiding, sometimes with a visual display showing muscle activity. One study using type II biofeedback in children who had PNE reported that 71% were cured and 25% improved. (16)The conclusions for all of the included studies were limited by the observational designs used and some by small sample sizes. All of the identified studies showed benefit and little risk of harm, suggesting the need for methodologically rigorous studies, including RCTs, to determine the relative effect of biofeedback compared with that of various controls. No adverse events were reported.Of the four studies investigating acupuncture/acupressure for PNE, results were either better than or similar to control techniques, including medications. Due to low quality and methodologic limitations, more rigorous studies are recommended. The results of the three hypnosis studies on PNE were mixed; replication of the studies would strengthen the evidence. Of the six observational studies of biofeedback, all reported cure or improvements over baseline. Controlled studies may provide more convincing evidence of the effect of biofeedback on NE. Studies suggest that acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback may offer nonpharmacologic treatments that can be used in conjunction with conventional interventions or when conventional interventions have failed or are contraindicated.No adverse events were reported for any of the interventions, suggesting that they are safe. However, the sample size in many of the studies was small, limiting their ability to detect harmful effects. Although the safety of acupuncture has been well documented, (17) the safety of hypnosis and biofeedback has been less well defined. A recent review of mind-body techniques concluded that negative effects generally are mild and transitory. (18) In situations in which safety information is lacking, use of a safety/efficacy grid such as that proposed by Cohen and Eisenberg (19) may be warranted.The authors gratefully acknowledge Connie Wither for her expert help with literature searching, Ashley Whidden for her help in initial literature screening, Sana Ishaque for data extraction, and Amy Moen for coordination of the series.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Ménière’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Objective Ménière’s disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies. Purpose The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.",

A dispnéia é um sintoma subjetivo e difícil de ser quantificado com exatidão, pois cada paciente o sente de uma forma diferente e, muitas vezes, o que é percebido pelo examinador não é a mesma sensação do paciente. Para esclarecer isso, esta pesquisa procurou reunir os métodos existentes de mensuração da dispnéia, com o objetivo de constatar qual o mais utilizado. Depois da análise de trinta e um artigos e da reunião de oito métodos que mensuram a dispnéia, concluiu-se que a escala modificada de Borg é o mais utilizado, seguido da Escala Analógica Visual, Escala do Conselho de Pesquisa Médica e Índice Basal de Dispnéia.",

      "abstract": "Ten patients with primary autonomic failure, followed up in a prospective clinical and laboratory study, were finally diagnosed as pure autonomic failure or multiple system atrophy with autonomic failure. Polysomnographic studies were performed in all patients. Whereas all four patients with multiple system atrophy complained of sleep related episodes suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) confirmed by polysomnography, RBD remained absent in the remaining six patients with pure autonomic failure. The data indicate that RBD is an important clinical feature, often heralding multiple system atrophy, but which is absent throughout the course of pure autonomic failure; its recognition can thus be useful in the prognostic evaluation of early primary autonomic failure syndromes.",

Sources of excessive daytime sleepiness in PD and DLB often include sleep fragmentation, side effects of medications, and sleep disorders that disrupt night-time sleep continuity. The parasomnia of REM sleep behavior disorder has also been shown to be an early feature of PD and DLB and a risk factor for dementia in PD. Dysfunction of the dopamine nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems is involved in Lewy body disease, but several other neurotransmitter systems have Lewy body pathology and neuronal loss that may be responsible for abnormal sleepiness and REM sleep behavior disorder in these conditions.",

      "title": "Sleep problems during the menopausal transition: prevalence, impact, and management challenges",
      "abstract": "A substantial number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with 26% experiencing severe symptoms that impact daytime functioning, qualifying them for a diagnosis of insomnia. Here, we review both self-report and polysomnographic evidence for sleep difficulties in the context of the menopausal transition, considering severity of sleep complaints and links between hot flashes (HFs) and depression with poor sleep. Longitudinal population-based studies show that sleep difficulties are uniquely linked with menopausal stage and changes in follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol, over and above the effects of age. A major contributor to sleep complaints in the context of the menopausal transition is HFs, and many, although not all, HFs are linked with polysomnographic-defined awakenings, with HF-associated wake time contributing significantly to overall wakefulness after sleep onset. Some sleep complaints may be comorbid with depressive disorders or attributed to sleep-related breathing or movement disorders, which increase in prevalence especially after menopause, and for some women, menopause, age, and environmental/behavioral factors may interact to disrupt sleep. Considering the unique and multifactorial basis for sleep difficulties in women transitioning menopause, we describe clinical assessment approaches and management options, including combination treatments, ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to hormonal and nonhormonal pharmacological options. Emerging studies suggest that the impact of severe insomnia symptoms could extend beyond immediate health care usage and quality of life issues to long-term mental and physical health, if left untreated in midlife women. Appropriate treatment, therefore, has immediate benefit as well as advantages for maintaining optimal health in the postmenopausal years.",

Devant une telle complexité, il n’est pas étonnant que des mécanismes impliquant plusieurs systèmes aient été proposés pour tenter d’élucider ce syndrome. Dans cet article de synthèse, nous proposons de diviser en neuf grandes catégories les différents mécanismes proposés pour expliquer les douleurs diffuses dont souffrent les patients fibromyalgiques : 1) un phénomène périphérique qui pourrait impliquer les systèmes musculaires, humoraux, vasculaires, immunitaires, ou endocriniens ; 2) une sensibilisation spinale ; 3) une dysfonction des mécanismes endogènes d’inhibition causée par un déficit des contrôles inhibiteurs diffus nociceptifs ; 4) l’existence d’une facilitation centrale, par augmentation des mécanismes cérébraux pronociceptifs ; 5) une perturbation des mécanismes psychiques (émotionnels et/ou cognitifs) ; 6) une modification des activités thalamiques et limbiques ; 7) des modifications au niveau de certaines activités neurohormonales hypothalamiques et hypophysaires ; 8) une dysfonction au niveau de l’activité autonomique ; 9) et des changements au niveau de l’architecture du sommeil. Il est fort possible que la réponse réside dans plus d’un mécanisme. Il est toutefois intéressant de voir comment chacune de ces théories permet de retrouver certaines pièces du casse-tête et pourrait mener à des modèles intégrateurs pour mieux soutenir la recherche de traitements plus efficaces pour soulager les patients qui souffrent de ce syndrome de douleurs diffuses encore mal compris.",

      "abstract": "We present a rare case of Non 24-Hour Sleep Wake Rhythm Disorder (N24SWD) in a sighted patient with normal functioning and intelligence. N24SWD is rare in non-blind patients. Sighted patients reported in the literature have had significant psychiatric, intellectual, developmental, or medical comorbidities. A 23-year-old male PhD student presented with a 5-year history of difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. His sleep and wake times were variable, but he averaged 8 hours of sleep in 24 hours. Two years before presenting to our sleep center, he underwent polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. It was significant for mean sleep latency of 5.5 minutes and normal AHI. Morning armodafinil was started for possible diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnolence by his previous sleep specialist. For insomnia, temazepam, zolpidem, and diphenhydramine were prescribed with minimal success. His medical history was significant for mild depression and anxiety, diagnosed three years after the onset of his circadian symptoms. It is currently being managed nonpharmacologically with optimal symptom control. For workup, 20-weeks of sleep diary data was obtained. During this time, he was on leave from school and allowed himself to wake and sleep spontaneously. He also abstained from all pharmacotherapy. The data showed progressive delay in sleep and wake times between 1 to 3 hours, consistent with N24SWD. Two weeks of actigraphy were obtained, confirming these results. He responded well to nightly melatonin. Morning light therapy and armodafinil were also prescribed, which the patient has not yet started. His functioning at his graduate school has significantly improved. Unlike many previously reported cases of N24SWD in sighted patients, our patient does not have intellectual and developmental disabilities. His mild depression and anxiety are well-controlled and were perhaps secondary to N24SWD. In previously reported cases, limited or inappropriate exposure to light or other entraining cues was noted, which was not the case in this patient.",

In addition to these general symptoms, the frequency of the simultaneous involvement of some of the cranial nerves, manifested by ophthalmoplegias, such as ptosis and facial palsy, suggested a localization of the disease in the brain. Examination of the spinal fluid threw very little light on the nature of the disease, the cells in most cases being within normal limits, and repeated bacteriologic examinations yielding no positive results. In addition to the involvement of isolated nuclei of the bulb, there were, in some other instances, other signs of cerebral involvement, such as ataxia and tremor,",

      "abstract": "An intensive care unit (ICU) stay is often a stressful and painful experience. Recent surveys indicate that 50–80% of patients experience pain during their ICU stay [1]. Critically ill patients experience pain more readily than healthy subjects; a phenomenon known as hypernociception. The most painful experiences for ICU patients are endotracheal suctioning and being turned in bed. In addition, many patients have pain at rest without a noxious stimulus [1]. This decreased threshold of pain in the ICU has been attributed to immobility and systemic inflammation. In addition to pain, ICU patients often suffer from stress, which has been frequently attributed to painful procedures. Other factors that may play a role in ICU stress include inability to communicate due to endotracheal intubation, interruption of sleep, hallucinations, and nightmares. This stressful experience is not without complications, as one retrospective study found that 25% of ICU patients with self-reported stressful experiences during their ICU stay, such as nightmares, anxiety, respiratory distress, or pain, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder four years later [2], thus, the importance of adequate analgesia and sedation to achieve patient comfort.",

      "title": "NARCOLEPTIC SYNDROME AND PARADOXICAL SLEEP",
      "abstract": "S ummary In order to elucidate the mechanism of the narcoleptic syndrome, the course of all‐night sleep was investigated by means of poly graphic methods or by using inducing stimuli. Further study on each symptom was performed in relation to the sleep mechanism using similar methods. Thirty‐three cases of typical narcolepsy were examined. The results from these studies are summarized as follows. 1. The paradoxical phase of sleep occurs immediately after sleep onset in the natural nocturnal sleep of narcoleptics. The proportion of sleep time spent in the paradoxical phase (30%) in narcoleptics is higher than in normals, whereas that of the deep sleep stage is lower. 2. In narcolepsy, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis appear mostly during the paradoxical phase. During these episodes the level of cerebral vigilance ascends temporarily but slight differences are found between these two episodes. The responses to the stimuli (auditory evoked response, the H reflex and the knee jerk) are similar to those in normals in each stage of sleep. 3. Chlorpromazine, being effective against hypnagogic hallucination and sleep disturbance, stabilizes a night's sleep and prolongs the duration of deep sleep and the paradoxical phase. Imipramine with a suppressing action on cataplectic attack, inhibits the occurrence of the paradoxical phase at sleep onset and diminishes the following paradoxical phases, accompanied by a decrease of hypnagogic hallucination. 4. The level of wakefulness tends to descend easily in narcoleptics. In sleep attacks, the subjects fall rapidly into the paradoxical phase from alert or drowsy state. Both sleep attacks and a tendency to fall asleep are apt to occur periodically in the daytime with lucid intervals. 5. A cataplectic attack closely relates to the paradoxical phase. During the episode, a great discrepancy is found between hypofunction of the arousal system and function of the motor and autonomic systems. Cataplectic occur frequently concomitant with the sleeping‐waking rhythm. 6. Fundamental disorders of narcolepsy are considered as follows: the abnormal occurrence of the paradoxical phase of sleep, the tendency to fall asleep easily, the sleep cycle through night and day and the remarkable dissociation of the arousal system from the motor or autonomic systems. Accordingly, disorders in the sleep‐wakefulness regulating mechanisms are found. Dysfunction of the brain stem reticular formation, especially in the pons, and disturbances of the interrelationship among them are discussed.",

Diagnosis is based on a record of intracranial pressure of over a limit of 250 mmH2O. Morbidity is basically due to possible loss of vision associated with atrophy of the optic nerve. When the aetiology is unknown this clinical condition is known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension.We describe the principal characteristics of a series of patients who were admitted to our department with the diagnosis of PC and review the relevant literature.Altogether 14 patients (12 women and 2 men) were admitted with the diagnosis of PC. In 12 patients the disorder presented with headache, with or without associated symptoms of disorders of vision. The main visual symptoms were transient darkening of vision, scotomas, photopsias and reduction in visual acuity. The headache was holocranial, continuous and well tolerated or alternatively uni or bilateral, pulsatile, moderate, with or without photophobia, and with or without nausea and vomiting. Bilateral papilloedema was seen in all patients. In one case there was also bilateral facial palsy and neck rigidity. In four cases visual field measurement were abnormal (inferoneasal scotoma, bilateral concentric reduction). Progress was poor in only one case.In spite of being theoretically benign, and there being many forms of treatment, PC may cause considerable morbidity of vision.

Se caracteriza por episodios repetidos de obstrucción parcial o completa de la faringe durante el sueño, que provocan hipoxia seguida de re-oxigenación y despertares transitorios, responsable de las alteraciones fisiopatológicas y síntomas, que aunque inespecíficos, son muy sugerentes. El paciente tipo de SAHOS, es un hombre obeso, de cuello corto, roncador de larga data, que acusa somnolencia diurna, sueño poco reparador, cansancio, nocturia y leve deterioro cognitivo. Su pareja observa la aparición progresiva de pausas respiratorias. Sin embargo, la presentación es heterogénea y se distinguen diferentes fenotipos clínicos. El diagnóstico se basa en la sospecha y la evaluación conjunta del cuadro clínico con estudios nocturnos confirmatorios adecuados, siguiendo algoritmos propuestos, usando desde PSG convencional hasta equipos simplificados. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common chronic and progressive disorder. It has cardiovascular, neurocognitive and metabolic consequences. Also has increased risk of accident, poor quality of life and higher mortality. About 5% of adult population and 2% of children aged 4 to 5 year are affected. OSAS therapy is efficient and cost effective, so early diagnosis and treatment are important. The hallmark feature is the recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep, which is associated with hypopxia-reoxygenation and microarousal which contributes to the pathophysiology and symptoms which are not specific but quite suggestive of the disease. The typical presentation of OSAS is represented by an overweight, gross neck male patient complaining of loud snoring, nocturia, excessive daytime sleepiness and mild cognitive impairment, with a history of witnessed apnoeas during sleep. Obstructive apnoea has a quite heterogeneous presentation form and different clinical phenotypes have been recognized. OSAS diagnosis is based on a high level of disease suspicion, complete clinical assessment and the adequate sleep study by using diagnostic algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The daily rhythm of cortisol secretion is relatively stable and primarily under the influence of the circadian clock. Nevertheless, several other factors affect hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Sleep has modest but clearly detectable modulatory effects on HPA axis activity. Sleep onset exerts an inhibitory effect on cortisol secretion while awakenings and sleep offset are accompanied by cortisol stimulation. During waking, an association between cortisol secretory bursts and indices of central arousal has also been detected. Abrupt shifts of the sleep period induce a profound disruption in the daily cortisol rhythm, while sleep deprivation and/or reduced sleep quality seem to result in a modest but functionally important activation of the axis. HPA hyperactivity is clearly associated with metabolic, cognitive and psychiatric disorders and could be involved in the well-documented associations between sleep disturbances and the risk of obesity, diabetes and cognitive dysfunction. Several clinical syndromes, such as insomnia, depression, Cushing's syndrome, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) display HPA hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, psychiatric and metabolic impairments. Further research to delineate the functional links between sleep and HPA axis activity is needed to fully understand the pathophysiology of these syndromes and to develop adequate strategies of prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders and stroke are intricately linked through a complex, bidirectional relationship. Sleep disturbances such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) not only increase the risk of stroke but also frequently emerge as consequences of cerebrovascular events. OSA, in particular, is associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of incident stroke, primarily through mechanisms involving intermittent hypoxia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation. Conversely, stroke can disrupt sleep architecture and trigger or exacerbate sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm disturbances, and breathing-related sleep disorders. These post-stroke sleep disturbances are common and significantly impair rehabilitation, cognitive recovery, and quality of life, yet they remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early identification and management of sleep disorders in stroke patients are essential to optimize recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therapeutic strategies include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, medical devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and emerging alternatives for CPAP-intolerant individuals. Despite growing awareness, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding non-OSA sleep disorders and their impact on stroke outcomes. Improved diagnostic tools, broader screening protocols, and greater integration of sleep assessments into stroke care are urgently needed. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the interplay between sleep and stroke, emphasizing the importance of personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Advancing research in this field holds promise for reducing the global burden of stroke and improving long-term outcomes through targeted sleep interventions.",

Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Chronic primary insomnia (CPI) is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide. CPI manifests as difficulties in sleep onset, maintaining sleep, prolonged sleep latency, and daytime impairment and is often accompanied by cognitive problems such as poor academic performance, poor attention, and decreased memory. The most popular explanation of insomnia is hyperarousal or increased activities of neurons. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep detected by polysomnography (PSG) exhibits a positive relationship with brain homeostasis and can be helpful for optimally preparing an organism for emotional and social function. Limited work has been performed to explore brain function of insomnia patients in combination with PSG analysis.We observed increased ALFF within areas related to hyperarousal such as the midbrain and bilateral extra-nucleus, whereas decreased ALFF was observed within areas associated with memory and attention involving the parietal and occipital lobule and others. Furthermore, the altered ALFF was associated with the duration of insomnia, sleep efficiency, duration of REM, latency of RME and ratio of REM.In this study, we recruited twenty-five CPI patients and twenty-five normal sleep (NS) volunteers as a control group to investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the correlation between those altered ALFF regions through resting-state fMRI and PSG data.These findings suggest that hyperarousal reflected by ALFF abnormality within brain areas related to cognition and emotion in insomnia associated with REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Primary care physicians once considered insomnia a nuisance diagnosis with which they had little concern. A complaint of insomnia is often brought to a physician's attention as a last-minute secondary complaint, which may be dismissed as unimportant by the physician. However, chronic insomnia is prevalent, associated with a decrease in quality of life, and can be an exacerbating factor in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Primary care physicians therefore should be aware of the signs of insomnia and include the detection of it in the evaluation of patients who present with other complaints or as part of annual physical examinations. Physicians can assess insomnia with tools they already use, such as a patient's initial history. If insomnia is detected, primary care physicians should work with patients to educate them. Management necessitates the inclusion of education and patient counseling about sleep hygiene and correction of dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors. It may also include pharmacologic treatment, nonpharmacologic treatment, or a combination of both.",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatments of Pediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION In a general sense, the operational definition of insomnia in children may be construed as similar to that in adults, i.e., significant difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep and/or non-restorative sleep (early morning awakening is an infrequent complaint in children). However, practically speaking, the most frequent clinical manifestations of childhood insomnia, particularly in younger children, are bedtime refusal or resistance, delayed sleep onset, and/or prolonged night wakings requiring parental intervention. It is estimated that overall 20% to 30% of children in cross-sectional studies are reported to have some significant bedtime problems and/or night wakings (1-7), and a recent study suggests that lifetime prevalence of insomnia in 13 to 16-year-old adolescents approaches 11% (8). These percentages are substantially higher in children with psychiatric comorbidities (9,10) and with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (11). Furthermore, there is clear evidence from both experimental laboratory-based studies and clinical observations that insufficient and poor quality sleep in children results in or exacerbates mood instability and behavioral dysregulation, impacts negatively on neurocognitive functions and academic performance (12-14), and affects caregivers, with significant repercussions on family functioning. Therefore, appropriate and effective management of insomnia in the pediatric population is an important therapeutic goal for mental healthcare providers.",

Discussion of some specific groups of patients with various combinations of both syndromes: long antecedents of headaches, leading up to sporadic epileptic attacks, focal or generalized; clinical seizures under photic stimulation (10% of the cases with chronic headaches without organic lesions); headaches in the latency period of symptomatic epilepsy; cases of seeming transition between the two syndromes; headaches as a substitute, an aura or as a component of the epileptic seizure, with clearly distinctive features between generalized and focal epilepsy: in patients with bilateral EEG paroxysms, headaches are usually diffuse or bilateral, in those with epileptogenic foci, headaches, if consistently localized, are always reported to be homolateral to the focus. Considerations concerning pathogenesis include the familiar hypothesis of hypoxic discharges following migrainous vasoconstriction, as well as secondary vascular headaches induced by focal epileptic activity. Headaches caused by excessive discharges in the sensory representation areas (H. Jackson) must be rare. Whether increased neuronal activity in the hypothalamus may be responsible for the migraine syndrome (Herberg), possibly in connection with biogenic amines, remains in open question.",

      "abstract": "Epileptic activity was recorded in the waking and sleep EEG of 62.5% of 80 siblings of 38 patients with absence seizures. Epileptic discharges were noted in waking only in 8.7%, in waking as well as sleep in 28.8%, and in sleep only in 25%. Generalized, partly irregular, and slow spike-wave complexes were found, twice with lateral emphasis. Spike-wave complexes were recorded in 72% of 50 siblings of patients with idiopathic absence and in 46.7% of 30 siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. One epileptic discharge was observed every 108.6 s on the average, without striking differences between siblings of patients with idiopathic (99.7 s) and symptomatic absence (119.3 s). Without any differences between siblings of children with idiopathic and symptomatic absence, the most epileptic discharges were activated in sleep stages C and D, followed by stages A and B. The highest activation rate was observed in the 7-14-year-old group (73.5%) and to a somewhat lesser degree in the group between 15 and 20 years of age (66.7%); fewer epileptic discharges were recorded in younger (25%) and older patients (28.6%). The higher activation rates in the male sex were significant only in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence. Although only five patients (13.2%) were photosensitive, a photosensitivity was found in 24% of siblings of children with idiopathic absence and in 20% of siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. Three siblings of patients with idiopathic absence also had absence seizures; in one of them a febrile seizure occurred at an earlier age. All of them showed generalized spike wave discharges in waking as well as sleep. Occipital theta delta activity with generalization was observed more frequently in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence (82.2%) than in those of patients with symptomatic absence (63.6%). Our waking and sleep EEG recordings prove that concerning etiology-genetic factors play a striking role in idiopathic absence, but are also of considerable significance in the symptomatic types.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an important risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. Numerous potential predictive markers of Parkinson's disease may present before motor symptoms emerge, but testing of these markers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has been performed only in small studies. There has been no comparison of markers between patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease, and between men and women. We evaluated an array of potential Parkinson's disease predictive markers in 159 patients; including 68 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 36 controls, 34 Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 21 Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrated substantial olfactory loss (P < 0.001). Olfaction was more impaired in Parkinson's disease than idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and did not differ between Parkinson's patients with, or without, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Numerous measures of motor function including the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale alternate tap, Purdue Peg Board and Timed 'Up and Go' were impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.01). All of these motor measures were worse with Parkinson's disease than with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, regardless of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status. Autonomic symptoms and systolic blood pressure drop were impaired in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P = 0.003). Orthostatic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease were found in the group with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). However, Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were not different than controls and had less impairment than those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P = 0.004) and Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). Colour vision was impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.001). However, only Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder had abnormalities significantly different than controls (P < 0.001), and there were significant differences between Parkinson's patients with or without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.04). Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients had slightly increased harm avoidance scores on personality testing (P = 0.04). Other than slightly better performances among women in the Purdue Peg Board, there was no difference in any measure between men and women, suggesting similar pathogenic processes underlying rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate abnormalities in numerous potential markers of neurodegenerative disease—these markers are heterogeneous, generally correlate with each other and occur equally in men and women. Although these abnormalities are usually intermediate between control values and Parkinson's patients, autonomic dysfunction and colour vision appear to be more linked to rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status than Parkinson's disease, suggesting a unique pathophysiology of these abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common symptom of many sleep disorders. EDS is the result of disturbed sleep or the sleep-waking process. The measurement of the degree of EDS is important for diagnosis and for its correlation with the severity of sleep disorders. We aimed to compare the characteristics of sleep disorders which were related to EDS and to investigate whether the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were correlated with the polysomnographic parameters. Methods 387 patients with EDS who completed both polysomnography (PSG) and MSLT were included. The severity of EDS was evaluated using ESS. Comparison of demographic, PSG, and MSLT results according to the final diagnosis and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subgroups categorized by the Apnea-Hypopnea Index. Results The ESS score did not differ between the groups, except for narcolepsy type 1 and delayed sleep phase disorder (p = 0.026). While the ESS score showed weak correlation with some PSG parameters, the mean sleep latency (mSL) of MSLT showed a significant and stronger correlation with PSG parameters. The mSL was significantly shorter in patients with severe OSA (4.6 ± 3.0, p < 0.001) while the ESS did not show any difference among the different severities of OSA (p = 0.754). Parameters which reflect OSA severity showed significant correlations with mSL. Conclusions ESS is insufficient for reflecting differences in the types and severities of sleep disorders, so the objective parameters of PSG and MSLT are necessary for more precise diagnosis. There was significant but weak correlation with mSL in the case of ESS ≥ 10, indicating that ESS was a poor screening tool but could be a convenient tool for follow-up study, rather than repeated MSLT.

The paradox refers to the disparity between the alert EEG pattern, implying that the person is awake or nearly so, and the indications that the person is actually more deeply asleep than at other times (difficulty in arousing, reduced muscle tone). The lack of muscle tone prevents the sleeper from performing the activities reflected in the alert EEG pattern. REM without atonia or REM behavior disorder is a sleep disorder in which the atonia fails to occur, with the result that the sleeper may actually perform his or her REM sleep actions.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy without cataplexy and non-REM parasomnias are both relatively rare disorders with prevalence of 0.05% and 2.5% respectively. Parasomnias occur more frequently in patients with narcolepsy, however, most of these parasomnias are REM related. A cross sectional study in Japan reported that dream enactment behavior occurs more in narcoleptics than controls. The most common presenting symptom of narcolepsy is excessive daytime sleepiness. We report a case of a 25 year old male with obstructive sleep apnea with good adherence to CPAP who presented with the chief complaint of parasomnias. From the age of 14 years he has had nightly episodes of complex parasomnias involving sleep walking, sleep talking and various dream enactment behaviors. The patient had been diagnosed with OSA 2 years ago and placed on CPAP at 15 cm of water pressure. In the past 367 days his adherence for four or more hours of use five nights per week was 75.7%. His average use for the nights he used CPAP was over 6 hours. His residual apnea hypopnea index was 2.1 events per hour. His Epworth was 15/24, and he was treating his fatigue by routine consumption of more than six cups of coffee a day. He denied cataplexy. A titration polysomnogram followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) revealed five brief episodes of NREM parasomnia in which the patient was talking, laughing, making purposeful movements and attempting to leave the bed. These episodes were unrelated to any breathing events. The MLST showed a severe tendency to sleepiness with a mean sleep latency of 3.3 minutes. Three of four naps showed early onset REM sleep. In conclusion, this patient had a rare presentation of narcolepsy, with the primary complaint of parasomnias over excessive daytime sleepiness. The role of caffeine in his parasomnias is unclear.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Central hypersomnolence disorders correspond to numerous etiologies of patients with a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, excessive quantity of sleep (i.e., hypersomnia), or sleep inertia (i.e., alteration in vigilance following waking up). Hypersomnolence significantly interferes with several aspects of life, including negative social and professional impacts. Several steps of evaluation of these patients are required to explore sleep, sleepiness, and hypersomnia; to quantify the severity of the condition; and to achieve a diagnosis of central hypersomnolence disorder. Hence, clinical interviews, questionnaires, sleep diaries, polysomnography, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, continuous 24-hour polysomnography recording, and additional tests in particular circumstances (measurement of hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid, HLA DQB1*06:02 genotyping, and brain magnetic resonance imaging) allow the definitive diagnosis of central hypersomnolence disorders. This chapter details the clinical signs, laboratory investigations, pathophysiology, management, and some perspectives on most etiologies of central hypersomnolence disorder as reported in the revised International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition: narcolepsy Type I and Type II; idiopathic hypersomnia; Kleine-Levin syndrome; insufficient sleep syndrome; and hypersomnia due to a medical disorder, due to a medication or substance, or associated with a psychiatric disorder.",

Most often patient complains of a headache originating frontal area. There are more than five various symptoms such as general malaise, numbness, tingling sensation, vertigo, sleeplessness. However, although symptoms are multiple, patients spend a life commonly. In other words, a patient is protected by a headache against his or her stress. No medication is needed in such a case. In epileptic headache, pressing type pain is felt over the forehead for several minutes to a few hours. Tremor or convulsion sometimes follow the headache. EEG shows spike and wave activities. In the case of focal epilepsy, headache occurs contralateral to the focus. Anti-epileptic drugs such as VPA or CBZ is a choice in such case, and headache as well as seizure disappears.

These include cluster headache, episodic paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, among others. Precise history taking is necessary for the treatment, because no drug is 100% effective.",

      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neck myoclonus ( NM ) is a frequent recently described sleep‐related motor phenomenon occurring mainly during REM sleep with uncertain effect on sleep continuity. To better describe this phenomenon we studied 11 consecutive drug‐free patients undergoing a video‐polysomnographic (V‐ PSG ) study who present at least 5 NM events in one single night of recording. All events were measured and checked for their association with rapid eye and leg movements, EEG arousals, awakenings and Bereitschaftspotential. One hundred and eighty‐two motor events from 11 subjects were analyzed. Motor events were approximately 0.5 s in duration and occurred during REM sleep in 79.7% of the cases. Only 14.8% of the events were associated with rapid eye movements, 52.2% with leg movements, while approximately 80% of them were accompanied by an arousal or awakening. No EEG abnormalities and Bereitschaftspotential were observed. For its duration and its segregation in sleep, NM could be more appropriately named “sleep‐related head jerks” ( SRHJ ). SRHJ should be recognized and its effect on sleep stability should be re‐considered.",

The diagnosis of VP is mainly based on the patient history and requires: A) at least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 1 minute; C) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; D) response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine; and F) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Probable VP is defined as follows: A) at least five attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 5 minutes; C) spontaneous occurrence or provoked by certain head-movements; D) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; E) not better accounted for by another diagnosis.Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the 8th cranial nerve, which is covered by oligodendrocytes, are the assumed mechanism. Important differential diagnoses are Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, epileptic vestibular aura, paroxysmal brainstem attacks (in multiple sclerosis or after brainstem stroke), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymph fistula, transient ischemic attacks and panic attacks. Current areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis of VP are: a) MRI findings of vascular compression which are not diagnostic of the disease or predictive for the affected side because they are also observed in about 30% of healthy asymptomatic subjects; and b) response to treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine supports the diagnosis but there are so far no randomized controlled trials for treatment of VP.",

Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity are the most frequent causes of OSA in children. The clinical manifestations of OSA include apneas (cessation of oronasal airflow) and hypopneas (reduction of airflow), accompanied by arousals from sleep, restless sleep, daytime symptoms (sleepiness, inattention, hyperactivity), and academic difficulties. Cysteinyl leukotrienes contribute to the pathogenesis of both asthma and OSA in childhood. Cysteinyl leukotrienes have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Preliminary evidence suggests that treatment of sleep apnea with adenotonsillectomy results in improved control of coexisting asthma.",

      "title": "Practical Approach for the Diagnosis and Management of Insomnia During Menopausal Transition",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Asthma and sleep disorders are both common in childhood, and often co‐exist in the same child. Moreover, studies have shown that in many children the rate of one is influenced by the other. Sleep disorders can be classified into six different groups—insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, movement disorders, circadian disorders, and sleep‐related breathing disorders. Children with asthma often present with complaints of insomnia with poor sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep and sleep disruptions. These complains are often associated with asthma control. They may also complain of daytime sleepiness and have higher rates of parasomnias, such as night terrors and nocturnal enuresis when compared with their healthy peers. Whether movement and circadian disorders are also more prevalent in children with asthma is less clear. Finally, there is a complex bidirectional interaction between sleep‐related breathing disorders and asthma: poor sleep and sleep disorders may worsen asthma, and asthma, particularly when it is poorly controlled, may impair sleep. In the current review we examine the association of each of the sleep disorders with asthma and review the common pathophysiological pathways. We hope to convince the reader that appropriate management of asthma must include inquiries into the patient's sleep, and vice versa.",

Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis.

      "abstract": "\"Somatosensory spike epilepsy\" is still little known, except in highly specialized places, because of two factors: 1) it is rare (the incidence in our experience is one case in 1,000 new EEGs); 2) the evoked spikes, that constitute the first sign for the evolution of the syndrome, are not systematically sought, and many months can pass before finding one \"positive\" cases. The evolution of a \"positive\" case towards epilepsy is represented by a 15% possibility. In this report we present two unique cases of this syndrome; they are of interest because they constitute the first such cases in the literature and also because of the neurophysiological problems that they reveal. The cases are represented by an eight year old girl and by an eleven year old boy, who suffered from the typical form of \"sensitive spike epilepsy\" characterized by its classical evolution in four stages, with a clinical phase of about one year. Two years after the cessation of previous seizures, they presented a new \"bouffee\" of partial motor seizures. The EEG abnormalities were in the parietal parasagittal region the first time, while they were situated in the temporoparietal region in the second time. The somatosensory spikes were evoked from the foot the first time and from the fingers the second time. In the second case the trigger zones were only on the left side of the body.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in Headache and Migraine",
      "abstract": "Headache and sleep disorders are prevalent, comorbid conditions that challenge physical as well as psychosocial well-being. Headache is the most common pain-related complaint and the seventh leading ailment seen in medical practice, accounting for 18 million physician visits annually in the USA alone (1). Though historically headache often has been trivialized (perhaps because pain is not easily quantified and headache does not generally compromise life expectancy), headache is in a major quality of life (QOL) concern. In fact, migraine headache is among the 20 leading causes of \"years lived with disability\" according the World Health Report (2). The burden of headache is increasingly appreciated in psychological, family and interpersonal, vocational, and economic realms. Headache, particularly in its more chronic and severe forms, has been linked to sleep disorders. Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are varied in nature, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. General symptom patterns, particularly morning headache and chronic daily headache, are suggestive of and aid in recognition of a sleep disorder. Management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache; sleep-disordered breathing is the most empirically supported example of this relationship. Although pure sleep-related headaches, such as hypoxemia-related headache, are less prevalent and more easily recognized, primary headaches as well are often impacted to some degree by sleep. Irrespective of sleep disorders, variation in the sleep/wake schedule is one of the most common acute headache precipitants while sleeping is one of the most common palliative responses to headache. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Despite an emerging literature supporting the interdependence of sleep and headache, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. Few well-controlled studies are available, and it is difficult to generalize results across sleep and headache literatures due to inconsistencies in diagnostic nosologies, lack of standardized outcome measures, and varied populations. Future research with improved methods is needed to identify mediating factors between sleep and headache. This chapter reviews the co-morbidity of headache and sleep disorders, prevalence, diagnostic considerations, societal and individual burden of headache, clinical implications, and considerations for future directions.",

      "title": "Children Presenting With Complex Febrile Seizures Do Not Routinely Need Computed Tomography Scanning in the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "The most common seizures experienced by young children are febrile seizures,1,2 which affect up to 4% to 5% of children ≤5 years old in the United States and Europe.1,2 In other portions of the world, the frequency may exceed 10% to 15%.2 Febrile seizures are defined as seizures associated with a febrile illness in the absence of central nervous system infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children >1 month of age without previous afebrile seizures.3 These seizures have been defined further as simple or complex: simple febrile seizures are generalized seizures that last <15 minutes and do not recur within 24 hours,3,4 and complex febrile seizures are defined as focal and/or prolonged (>15 minutes) and/or occur in a series over 24 hours.3,4 The associated morbidity and mortality from febrile seizures is extremely low, with no associated adverse cognitive outcomes even when the seizures are prolonged.1,5,6 Risk factors predicting first febrile seizure, recurrent febrile seizures, and subsequent epilepsy have been well enumerated1 (see Table 1).Although there has existed ample investigation and data concerning initial management, treatment approaches, and outcomes in children with simple febrile seizures, there has been somewhat less well-developed data concerning complex febrile seizures. This is particularly true in regards to neuroimaging in the context of complex febrile seizures in an emergency-department setting. In this issue of Pediatrics, Teng et al7 provide solid footing to avoid unnecessary neuroimaging within the emergency-department context in children who present with complex febrile seizures. Data from 79 children with a first complex febrile seizure (72% with a single complex feature and 28% with multiple complex features) and no prior neurologic, neurosurgical, or chronic medical illness were presented. These subjects were identified by careful criteria and represented 27% of a total of 293 children who presented with a first febrile seizure. Eight children were ultimately excluded from study: 4 because of a history of developmental delays; 2 because of previous unprovoked seizures; and 2 because of lack of follow-up.7 Thus, the final cohort of subjects included 71 children: 49 subjects (79%) were described as well appearing; 2 (3%) were lethargic or inconsolable; and 11 (18%) were described as “unclear” in general appearance.7 Among the subjects studied, 24 had focal seizures and 14 had prolonged isolated or multiple prolonged seizure events. Emergency neuroimaging with computed tomography (CT) scanning was obtained in 10 subjects. An additional 36 subjects underwent MRI imaging within 1 week as part of a prospective study. No subject had significant intracranial pathology requiring emergency medical or neurosurgical intervention.7These findings both complement and amplify available published data on children with complex febrile seizures (see Table 2). Previously published studies were comprised of children presenting to emergency departments with seizures that were later subdivided into first seizure, epilepsy, simple febrile seizures, complex febrile seizures, and seizures that were symptomatic or idiopathic. The current study is only the second large-scale study that focused on the prospective recruitment of subjects with complex febrile seizures.Subjects were identified both concurrently (during evaluation by a treating physician) and later (through chart and log-book review by research assistants). Subjects had eligibility criteria carefully applied so that ascertainment was likely to have been nearly complete. However, data-collection forms were completed for most but not all subjects (62 of 71 [87%]). Still, this is a major accomplishment and points out the challenge of conducting clinical research projects with the cooperation and coordination of multiple providers over an extended period of time (3 years). Absolute short-term outcomes were known for the 46 subjects (65%) who eventually underwent neuroimaging. Reliable longer-term outcomes were available for 25 subjects (17%) who were contacted by telephone within the subsequent 4 to 44 months (median: 22.4 months) and the remaining 13 subjects (18%) for whom medical-chart review was needed.Previously published retrospective data have demonstrated variable utilization rates of neuroimaging for subjects who presented with complex febrile seizures (Table 2). Children with complex febrile seizures are not easily extrapolated from some composite and heterogeneous studies. However, there are few subjects identified with abnormalities on neuroimaging (CT scanning used to a greater degree than MRI). These abnormalities have generally been without requirement for additional medical or surgical intervention, similar to that demonstrated in the study by Teng et al.7 There are isolated case reports of brain abscess, nonaccidental trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, encephalitis, etc that present as what was thought to be a complex febrile seizure. Clinical course later identified the child as requiring additional evaluation. Prolonged alteration in mental status, meningismus, persisting postictal focal deficits, and toxic appearance, among others, should raise clinical suspicion. Therefore, from a practical point of view, in an emergency-department setting the question that should be asked is, “what important and clinically relevant data requiring immediate intervention will be learned by obtaining an emergency CT scan for this patient at this time?” The answer would most often seem to be none. There are always individual patients who may have clinically significant neuroimaging findings that would be better evaluated with MRI at presentation or at a later time. These treatment decisions need to be determined individually to avoid the impulse to routinely obtain a CT scan in each child presenting with a complex febrile seizure. As the authors in the current study and previous authors have emphasized, underlying medical conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, and/or abscess need to be suspected clinically and evaluated for specifically in this context.1,2,6,15 Hospitalization and continued observation may be necessary. Later neuroimaging with MRI may be considered in children who present with complex febrile seizures if risk factors for subsequent epilepsy exist or there is a need to further evaluate underlying neurologic symptoms, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, or symptomatic seizures (brain dysgenesis, neurocutaneous syndrome, etc). It remains controversial whether febrile seizures, particularly prolonged complex febrile seizures, cause the later development of mesial temporal sclerosis.16 Retrospective studies have suggested that complex febrile seizures are a causative factor, whereas prospective studies have not.16 Genetic and environmental factors exert an up to now less-well-studied but significant influence.16Factors unrelated to the clinical evaluation of the patient are often at work when neuroimaging is obtained in an emergency-department setting. Among these include insistence by parents because of high anxiety, the relative ease of CT scanning availability, and relative lack of accessibility to specialty consultation. Although neuroimaging may help to allay some anxiety regarding serious intracranial pathology, it is unnecessary in most circumstances and may carry with it a longer-term risk of radiation-induced morbidity. Although these radiation risks are small for the individual, they are appreciable when you consider the population-based estimates of lifetime cancer mortality risks.17,18 There is generally an additional need for the administration of conscious sedation. This itself carries additional risks both directly from possible respiratory depression and indirectly by obscuring the clarity of subsequent mental status examination. Furthermore, MRI would be a more sensitive and clinically useful neuroimaging tool for most patients who are undergoing neurologic evaluation in the absence of suspected trauma or an immediate neurosurgical problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a condition characterized by subjective complaints of insufficient sleep and poor daytime functioning. Objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning, however, seldom show evidence of a similar degree of dysfunction. Most insomniacs, for example, do not suffer from sleep deprivation or daytime sleepiness. This discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning suggests that cognitive factors may play a central role in persistent insomnia. In particular, it is argued that fears about insufficient sleep and its adverse daytime consequences tend to interfere with sleep, thereby causing a vicious cycle which serves to maintain the insomnia. It is also argued that perfectionist standards and other dysfunctional beliefs may predispose people to these kinds of fears. Finally, existing models for cognitive-behavioural treatment of insomnia are criticized for being almost exclusively focused on the night-time aspects of insomnia. If insomnia is maintained by various kinds of vicious cycles involving fears, beliefs, and standards with regard to daytime functioning, these daytime aspects of insomnia should receive more attention in cognitive-behavioural treatment.

      "abstract": "Sleeping disturbance constitutes a major problem occurring in 25% of people aged over 65. Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

      "abstract": "Summary Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of non‐rapid eye movement (non‐REM) sleep. Non‐REM parasomnia behaviours have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream‐like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterise the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental (dis)connection associated with behavioural episodes, 35 adult patients with non‐REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in‐depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviours (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterised by delusional thinking to varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni‐ or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%), and variable, but often pronounced, amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (“awake dreaming”). The surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people), or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness, amnesia and sensory disconnection during non‐REM parasomnia episodes is variable and graded. In their full‐fledged expression, non‐REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep‐related sensory disconnection and dreaming.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "The term transient global amnesia was first coined by Fisher and Adams in 1964 to describe a clinical syndrome characterised by the abrupt onset of severe amnesia usually accompanied by repetitive questioning, occurring in middle aged or elderly people, and lasting several hours.1 The aetiology of transient global amnesia has been a topic of debate, but in the past few years the situation has become considerably clearer with the emergence of the following diagnostic criteria: (1) attacks must be witnessed and information available from an observer who was present for most of the attack, (2) there must be clear cut anterograde amnesia during the attack, (3) clouding of consciousness and loss of personal identity must be absent and the cognitive impairment limited to amnesia, (4) there should be no accompanying focal neurological symptoms and functionally relevant focal signs, (5) epileptic features must be absent, (6) attacks must resolve within 24 hours, and (7) patients with recent head injury or known active epilepsy are excluded.2 3 Epidemiological studies which have applied these criteria have established that thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease plays no part in the causation of transient global amnesia, but the incidence of migraine in patients with transient global amnesia is greater than would be expected in the general population. A small minority of cases with unusually brief, and recurrent, attacks eventually manifest temporal lobe epilepsy.3 \n\nTurning to the neuropsychological aspects, much has been learned about the organisation and neural basis of human memory since the initial description of transient global amnesia. It is clear that memory is not a unitary function but consists of interactive systems.4 5 One broad distinction, which derives from experimental studies of patients with amnesia, is that between explicit and implicit memory; explicit memory refers to memory available to conscious access; implicit …",

      "title": "What is central sleep apnea?",
      "abstract": "Central sleep apnea (CSA) describes a group of conditions in which cessations in air flow occur without respiratory effort. In contrast, obstructive sleep apnea patients have ongoing respiratory effort during respiratory events. However, considerable overlap exists in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnea and CSA. A good working knowledge of the mechanisms underlying CSA is important for optimal clinical care. In general, CSA can be classified into those with excessive drive (eg, Cheyne-Stokes breathing) versus those with inadequate drive (eg, sleep hypoventilation syndrome). One critical factor contributing to the cessation of air flow during sleep is the concept of the apnea threshold, such that a P(aCO(2)) value below a certain level will lead to cessations in breathing. P(aCO(2)) can fall below the chemical apnea threshold when drive is excessive (eg, robust chemosensitivity) or when hyperventilation is occurring (eg, following arousal). Another important factor is the loss of the so-called wakefulness drive to breathe, such that some rise in P(aCO(2)) is likely to occur at the onset of sleep. A variety of factors contribute to this rise, including upper-airway collapse and diminished chemosensitivity (particularly during rapid-eye-movement sleep). In patients with low central drive, this further loss of drive at sleep onset can lead to marked hypercapnia in some cases. The treatment of CSA is also reviewed in some detail, including a role for positive airway pressure (eg, bi-level positive airway pressure in hypoventilation patients) and optimization of medical therapy (eg, in Cheyne-Stokes breathing). A paucity of research exists in this area, emphasizing the opportunities for young investigators who are interested in this field.",

      "abstract": "Modern sleep research studies have provided the practicing physician with considerable new information concerning the basic psychophysiology of sleep, the effects of medical conditions on sleep and the role of maturational and emotional factors in producing certain sleep disorders. Medical and psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders and drug-induced sleep stage alterations are studied in the sleep laboratory using the same techniques developed to analyze sleep patterns in normal subjects. After initial sleep laboratory adaptation, a profile of the sleep characteristics of various clinical conditions is obtained. This profile can be compared to sleep profiles of normal subjects as well as to the effects on sleep of subsequent experimental or therapeutic procedures. Various studies have shown that coronary artery, duodenal ulcer and nocturnal headache patients experience angina, increased gastric acid secretion and migraine or cluster headaches, respectively during REM sleep. Adult nocturnal asthmatic episodes occur out of all sleep stages while attacks of dyspnea in asthmatic children occur in all stages except stage 4 sleep. Hypothyroid patients show decreases in stages 3 and 4 sleep, while in hyperthyroid patients the percentage of time spent in stages 3 and 4 sleep is markedly increased. Enuretic episodes occur predominantly in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleepwalking and night terror episodes occur exclusively out of NREM sleep, particularly from stages 3 and 4 sleep. Most child somnambulists and children with night terrors “outgrow” this disorder, suggesting a delayed maturation of the central nervous system. Stimulant drugs are effective in the treatment of the sleep attacks of narcolepsy and in treating certain cases of hypersomnia, while imipramine is an effective treatment for the auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy. Psychological disturbances are frequent in adult somnambulism and night terrors as well as in hypersomnia and insomnia. Proper pharmacologic treatment to provide symptomatic relief for insomnia is recommended to enhance the psychotherapeutic process.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent sleep-related breathing disorder in children with a prevalence of approximately 3% between the ages of 3 and 8. Its origin is multifactorial (hypertrophy of pharyngeal soft tissues, narrowing of the bone airways, damage to the neuromuscular tone). The symptoms and clinical signs to look for during the day and at night are directly related to upper airway (UA) obstruction or poor sleep quality. After a complete anamnestic and clinical evaluation, including nasofibroscopy, the ENT specialist will refer to an adeno-amygdalectomy or night recording by polysomnography or polygraph to confirm the diagnosis in the child. Among adolescents, the prevalence of OSAS is reported to be between 0.5 and 6%. The main risk factors are obesity, male sex and a history of tonsillectomy. In addition to the classic symptoms of childhood OSAS, this syndrome may, in adolescents, manifest itself as a misleading semiology of dyssomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and/or mood disorders. Differential diagnoses with risk behaviours, phase delay or narcolepsy should be systematically discussed. It is essential to record breathing during sleep. Even if the obstructive apnea/hypopnea index is low, it must be considered. In both children and adolescents, multidisciplinary management (ENT, orthodontist, maxillofacial physiotherapist, pulmonologist) should be early in order to avoid neurocognitive, behavioural, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Maxillofacial surgery can be discussed from the age of 15. It is important not to forget to pay attention to the rules of healthy living and sleep as well as the management of obesity.",

As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

      "abstract": "Sleep has been found to have wide-ranging effects on sports performance and overall well-being. Recent research has found evidence relating chronic suboptimal sleep with the risk of musculoskeletal pain and sports injury. The amount of sleep that consistently has been found to be associated with increased risk of injury is ≤7 h of sleep, which when sustained for periods of at least 14 d has been associated with 1.7 times greater risk of musculoskeletal injury. However, it is unknown if sleep loss predisposes the athlete to specific types of musculoskeletal injuries. The role of sleep on musculoskeletal pain is important to understand as studies in both children and adults have found that suboptimal sleep more consistently predicts next-day pain as compared with pain predicting subsequent sleep loss. Despite the evidence that certain aspects of sleep behavior seem to increase the risk of musculoskeletal injury and pain, sleep should be considered as only a part of the athlete's overall health and well-being when assessing the athlete for risk of injury.",

It presents the clinical history, examination, follow-up, treatment, diagnosis, and the results of the procedures performed on the patient. Nocturnal video-polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were ordered. She went into REM sleep, without going into any other sleep stages at the beginning of the MSLT in three of the five naps. The diagnosis was narcolepsy with cataplexy. Sodium oxybate was administered and titrated twice nightly, which helped further decrease her cataplexy to once or twice daily. Cataplexy may take the form of prolonged waxing and waning, with partial or complete muscle atonia, called status cataplecticus. Schizophreniamay be co-morbid or an intrinsicmanifestation of narcolepsy. Obesity is frequently observed in association with narcolepsy, contributing to sleepiness.",

The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this condition are still incompletely understood; recent data suggest that the abnormal epileptic EEG activity occurring during sleep might cause the typical clinical symptoms by interfering with sleep‐related physiologic functions, and possibly neuroplasticity processes mediating higher cortical functions such as learning and memory consolidation.

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

Schwindelpatienten mit Angstsyndrom leiden aber stärker unter ihrer Schwindelerkrankung.

Once believed to be restricted to the affluent societies of the West, a growing body of evidence suggests that it transcends global socioeconomic divisions to affect a larger proportion of the world population than was originally thought.1 Despite the lack of awareness about the disease, it increases morbidity and mortality in patients by disrupting sleep patterns and inducing a generalised state of chronic inflammation secondary to hypoxia. Studies have also suggested that it correlates with several chronic diseases, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and neurocognitive deficits, although causation has not been proved.2 #### Box 1 Glossary of terms3",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

The aims of our study were to quantify the self-reported prevalence and type of sleep disturbances in patients with different functional bowel disorders (FBD) and to determine if this prevalence is related to involvement of the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, perceived disease severity, or psychological comorbidity.We enrolled 505 new FBD patients from an academic referral center specializing in functional GI disorders and 247 community based healthy controls. All patients and controls were prospectively evaluated by validated bowel symptom and sleep questionnaires. A psychological profile was obtained by SCL-90R.We found that 68% of functional dyspepsia (FD), 71.2% of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)+FD, 50.2% of IBS, and 55.1% of the normal subjects reported having sleep disturbances. Waking up repeatedly during the night and waking up in the morning feeling tired or not rested were the most commonly reported sleep patterns; 57.2% of the patients reported that their abdominal ache awakened them from sleep during the night. Self-reported sleep disturbance was directly related to the perceived intensity of GI symptoms. Self-reported sleep disturbances were equally common in both male (57%) and female (58.4%) FBD patients. There was no significant difference between the mean anxiety and depression scores between patients with and without sleep dysfunction.FD patients, but not IBS patients, reported sleep disturbances more frequently than healthy control subjects. Abdominal pain or discomfort that awaken FBD patients from sleep during the night were common, and thus a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional disorders.",

In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked and marked effort on the part of the individual is required until the obstruction is broken, allowing respiration to occur again. If the apnea is sustained and frequent, one may see end organ damage. Muscle tone and neural output is changed during sleep. In obstructive sleep apnea, the majority of people have no difficulty breathing during the day, however during their normal sleeping time, these neuromuscular inputs are altered in such a fashion that the obstruction occurs. It is not uncommon for a Mueller type maneuver to occur, which increases vagus tone leading to bradycardia, sinus arrest and even asystole. Hypoxemia leads to increased sympathetic discharge which in turn can lead to systemic hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine mechanisms are major determinants of the normal 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern. At the central level, integration of the major driving factors of this temporal variability is mediated by circadian rhythms of monoaminergic systems in conjunction with those of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, opioid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, plus endothelial systems and specific vasoactive peptides. Humoral secretions are typically episodic, coupled either to sleep and/or the circadian endogenous (suprachiasmatic nucleus) central pacemaker clock, but exhibiting also weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual periodicities. Sleep induction and arousal are influenced also by many hormones and chemical substances that exhibit 24-h variation, e.g., arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, melatonin, somatotropin, insulin, steroids, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin E2, all with established effects on the cardiovascular system. As a consequence, physical, mental, and pathologic stimuli that activate or inhibit neuroendocrine effectors of biological rhythmicity may also interfere with, or modify, the temporal BP structure. Moreover, immediate adjustment to exogenous components/environment demands by BP rhythms is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of biological oscillators and their neuroendocrine effectors. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of abnormalities of the 24-h BP pattern and level and their correction through circadian rhythm-based chronotherapeutic strategies.

      "abstract": "To evaluate the occurrence of continued intermittent headache and chronic daily headache in patients with head injury and the relationship between severity of the headache problem and intensity of the head injury.In the majority of patients with posttraumatic headache, the condition is self-limited, but a minority of patients may develop persistent headaches. The features of posttraumatic headache may vary, but the most distressing type is the chronic daily headache. This study evaluates occurrence of chronic daily headache in relation to the intensity of head injury.All patients with head injury who were seen by the senior author (J.R.C.) in the Southern Illinois University Medical School (SIUMS) Neurology Clinic between 1980 and 1991 were identified from the SIUMS headache registry. Data on headache status before and after head injury was obtained, and patients with more than one headache per week before head injury were excluded. Each patient's headache status at the time of the clinic visit was classified as chronic daily headache (headache occurring at least 5 of 7 days for 6 months), intermittent migraine, or no headache. Head injury severity was graded by duration of loss of consciousness or amnesia as minimal (less than 5 minutes), mild (5 to 60 minutes), moderate (1 to 24 hours), or severe (more than 24 hours).There was an inverse relation between extent of head injury and occurrence of chronic daily headache. For minimal head injury (n = 54), 80% had chronic daily headache, and 11% had no headache, while for moderate/severe head injury (n = 23), only 27% had chronic daily headache, and 68% had no headache (P<.001, chi2).This study suggests that the risk of developing posttraumatic chronic daily headache is greater for less severe head injury compared with moderate/severe head injury. The reason for this relation is unclear.",

      "abstract": "Sleep/wake disorders are common in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, sometimes the most prominent or sole initial symptom, then delaying diagnosis. Sleep/wake disorders in autoimmune encephalitis vary and include severe sleeplessness, hypersomnia, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, indeterminate sleep/wake states, and loss of circadian sleep/wake rhythms. N-methyl- d aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR) is often associated with insomnia, then hypersomnia and sleep-related central hypoventilation. Profound sleeplessness and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are seen in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies. Fragmented sleep and hypersomnia are common in paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-MA protein encephalitis; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in those with antibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein (LGI1) or contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Antibodies against a cell adhesion protein IGLON5 may result in obstructive sleep apnea, inspiratory stridor, disorganized nonrapid eye movement sleep, and excessive movements and parasomnias fragmenting nonrapid and rapid eye movement sleep. Recognizing a particular sleep/wake disorder is often a presenting or prominent feature in certain autoimmune encephalitis permit for earlier diagnosis. This is important because reduced morbidity and better short- and long-term outcomes are associated with earlier diagnosis and immunotherapies.",

Sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations were most frequent in narcolepsy-cataplexy, but their frequency did not differ between narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Mean durations of nocturnal sleep, daytime naps, and morning grogginess were not increased in idiopathic hypersomnia compared with other groups. Among subjects without cataplexy, symptoms of sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations were equally common in subjects with and without frequent sleep-onset REM periods. These findings suggest that the occurrence of these symptoms in subjects without classical narcolepsy-cataplexy is a function of factors other than a propensity for early onset of REM sleep and indicate a need to reevaluate diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.",

Recent findings Insomnia, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are commonly reported in essential tremor, Wilson's disease, tics or Tourette's syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been observed in Wilson's disease and SCA. A combination of REM and non-REM parasomnias, along with nocturnal stridor with the initiation of sleep and re-entering after awakening, are characterized by undifferentiated Non-REM and poorly structured N2 in anti-IgLON5 disease. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been reported commonly in SCAs. Sleep-related dyskinesia has been reported in ADCY5-related disease and GNAO1-related movement disorder. Summary Sleep problems can manifest as a result of movement disorders, either through direct motor disturbances or secondary nonmotor symptoms. Medication effects must be considered, as certain medications for movement disorders can exacerbate or alleviate sleep disturbances. Distinguishing sleep problems in some diseases might involve pathognomonic symptoms and signs, aiding in the diagnosis of movement disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

All presented an important reduction in deep sleep stages (-93.1 (SD 17.9)% of stage IV and -77.2 (45.7)% of stage III) and frequent episodes of wakening ('arousals'), factors which are involved in fibromyalgia. One patient (3%) met the criteria for fibromyalgia; the estimated prevalence of fibromyalgia for patients attending a general medical clinic is 6%. No significant correlation was found between the number of points which were tender upon pressure and the various sleep parameters studied.

      "abstract": "Possible interactions between the sleep-wakefulness cycle and a new kind of spontaneous epilepsy, expressed as absence-like seizures and spike-wave bursts in FMUSP rats, are evaluated. The electro-oscillograms of some cortical and subcortical regions of the brain were recorded, as well as head, rostrum/vibrissae and eye movements. Recordings were performed uninterruptedly during 24 hours. The seizures were mostly concentrated in the wakefulness state but they could occur in any other phase, including paradoxical sleep. After the seizure, the rats usually returned to the same phase that was interrupted, although they often returned to wakefulness. There was an intense fragmentation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The incidence of each cycle phase was significantly reduced, except SIII of synchronized sleep and paradoxical sleep, thus maintaining the overall duration and architecture of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The fragmentation of the cycle seems to be due to an impairment of the very processes that generate sleep and wakefulness. Electrophysiological and behavioral profiles of the FMUSP rats recommend accurate and comprehensive study of the animal model owing to its resemblance to seizures in humans and also to discrepancies with existing genetic or experimental epilepsy models.",

This article reviews studies that have attempted to determine the etiology and interrelation of these two symptom clusters. The research has clearly determined that the cause of the daytime sleepiness of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the fragmentation of sleep by the brief arousals that terminate each apneic event rather than the nocturnal hypoxemia that also occurs in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. However, the daytime sleepiness and nocturnal hypoxemia appear to both contribute to the neurocognitive impairments of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and each seems to affect specific aspects of neurocognitive performance. The extent to which treatment reverses the neurocognitive impairments of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is yet to be fully determined. The initial study suggests that the impairments are not completely reversed with treatment.",

A total of 26 infants had electrographical signs of repeated seizure activity. Among these infants 14 had periods of one hour or more of silent seizures, i.e. typical pattern of ictal epileptic activity on CFM without clinical symptoms or signs of convulsions. The occurrence of silent seizures and their pattern in relation to the clinical condition and management was unpredictable in most cases. Besides general limpness or flaccidity in an outward quiet baby these infants showed no clinical fits or clonic convulsions.

      "abstract": "Comorbidities of sleep disorders in childhood and adolescence: focus on migraine Claudia Dosi,1 Assia Riccioni,1 Martina della Corte,1 Luana Novelli,1 Raffaele Ferri,2 Oliviero Bruni1 1Department of Social and Developmental Psychology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy; 2Sleep Research Centre, Oasi Institute for Research on Mental Retardation and Brain Aging (IRCCS), Troina, Italy Abstract: The correlation and/or comorbidity between sleep disorders and headache has been reported in numerous studies, but the exact nature of the association between headache, disordered sleep, and underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. The bidirectional association between sleep and headache is mediated by a temporal link (headache occurs during sleep, after sleep, and in relationship with sleep stages), by a quantitative relationship (excess, lack, bad quality, short duration of sleep may trigger headache), and by a reciprocal connection (headache may cause sleep disruption and may be associated with several sleep disturbances). This association is most evident for primary headache disorders, especially in childhood. A congenital alteration of neurotransmitter pathways (serotoninergic and dopaminergic) might predispose individuals to both disorders, presenting as sleep–wake rhythm disorder in infancy or as headache disorder later in childhood, as result of this neurotransmitter imbalance. Clinicians should be aware that a complete clinical evaluation of childhood headache includes a careful sleep history, taking into account that the treatment of sleep disturbances could lead to an improvement of headache symptoms and vice versa.

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common chronic sensory-motor neurological disorder that remains a clinical diagnosis. Most RLS patients present with sleep complaints in the form of initiation and/or maintenance insomnia as RLS has a circadian rhythmicity. An increased number of periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) is a supportive criterion in the diagnosis of RLS. Abnormalities in the central dopaminergic and iron systems are involved in the physiopathology of RLS. There is a higher prevalence of RLS and PLMS in sleep-disordered breathing patients, particularly those with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common sleep disorder in western societies. The complex mechanisms underlying the association between OSA, RLS and PLMS remain unclear. Untreated OSA can lead to adverse cardiovascular consequences due to cardio-metabolic dysfunction. It remains controversial whether RLS could further adversely impact the cardiovascular consequences of OSA. The PLMS do not have an additive effect on the hypersomnia experienced by some sleep-disordered breathing patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective therapy for OSA. The presence of PLMS during CPAP treatment could be a marker of an incomplete resolution of sleep-disordered breathing in the form of increased upper airway resistance syndrome, despite treatment. Dopaminergic agonists are the preferred agent for the treatment of RLS, and are indicated when RLS symptoms are frequent and affect quality of life. PLMS and RLS do not seem to contribute to the residual hypersomnia that can be observed in some sleep-disordered breathing patients despite adequate compliance and effective CPAP therapy.",

Participants with Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SCZ, (N = 617)), Bipolar disorders (BD, (N = 440)), and Healthy Controls (HC, (N = 173)) were included in the study. Sleep disturbances (insomnia, hypersomnia and delayed sleep phase) were identified based on items from the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Clinician rated scale. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale and level of functioning with the Global assessment of Functioning scale. The rate of any sleep disturbance was 78% in SZ, 69% in BD and 39% in HC. Insomnia was the most frequently reported sleep disturbance across all groups. Both diagnostic groups reported significantly more of any sleep disturbances than HC (P < 0.001). Having a sleep disturbance was associated with more severe negative and depressive symptoms and with lower functioning across diagnostic groups (P < 0.001, η2 = 0.0071). Hypersomnia was the only sleep disturbance associated with previous treatment history. Sleep disturbances, including insomnia, hypersomnia and delayed sleep phase, are frequent in SCZ and BD, and associated with more severe clinical symptomatology across diagnostic groups. This suggests that sleep disturbance is a clinically relevant transdiagnostic phenomenon.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

A detailed history of the sleep and wakefulness cycles constitutes the second step. This is followed by the medical history of the patient; a list of previously used medications; family history; detailed information about school, work, family, and social life; and a physical exam of bodily systems. Relevant laboratory tests are performed for differential diagnosis. Polysomnography (PSG) is a golden standard diagnostic method that records electrophysiological signals used for sleep physiology and diseases.

We suggest the lower frequency of seizures in the ES group and the declining prevalence of sleep epilepsy are due to: 1) the high proportion of generalized as opposed to partial seizures in sleep and 2) more effective control of generalized seizures compared to partial seizures by modern anti-epileptic drug management.",

      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

The problems range from nocturnal issues such as difficulty with sleep initiation, sleep fragmentation, disturbance of circadian rhythm, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, to daytime problems such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Frequent nighttime awakening and sleep disruption are the most common sleep problems in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine plays an important role in maintaining wakefulness. To improve sleep in Parkinson's disease, it is important to achieve the critical balance of adequate dopaminergic therapy and control of symptoms. Increased dopaminergic agents can cause dyskinesias and painful dystonia, and undertreatment can cause nighttime akinesia, rigidity, and worse quality of sleep. Other nondopaminergic drugs commonly used in Parkinson's disease can also affect sleep. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has a favorable impact on sleep quality and sleep architecture.",

Insomnia is the most common complaint in routine clinical practice. It is characterized by different impairments in sleep and daytime awakening. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is less common, but more clinically important because of its negative impact on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The common neurological disorders are restless legs syndrome and REM sleep behavior disorder, as well as narcolepsy, the major manifestations of which are impaired nocturnal sleep and daytime awakening.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of upper airway hypotonia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The onset of sleep is associated with a reduction in upper airway patency and an increase in resistance, an effect observed in normal humans and animals, and typically present in snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome ( 1-5 ). Patients with OSA commonly have structural abnormalities that result in a narrowed upper airway and collapsible pharyngeal walls. During sleep, the airway cross-sectional area decreases considerably and the patients experience repeated, clinically signifi cant, obstructive apneas or hypopneas. However, when OSA patients are awake, their airway remains patent (except during swallowing, speech, etc.). This sleep-wake-state dependence of the disorder points to the involvement of neural mechanisms. The marked increase in resistance is attributed to a sleep-related alteration in the neural control of upper airway striated muscles. In particular, decrements in the activity of upper airway dilator muscles, that is, those that counteract the collapsing force of the negative pressure generated in the airway during inspiration, play a permissive role in sleep-related airway obstructions.",

      "title": "Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "An awakening has taken place over the last 25 years to the science of sleep disorders. Foremost amongst these, both in the medical world and the public eye, has been Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (SAS). The prevalence is thought to be the order of 1-2%. Males are eight times more commonly affected than females, although after the menopause the gap narrows considerably. Sleep apnoea occurs in children, usually in relation to large tonsils and adenoids, but in adult life patients usually present between the age of 40 and 60 and the prevalence increases with age. Numerous apnoeas or hypopnoeas during the night's sleep result in disordered sleep architecture and unrefreshing sleep. This is usually accompanied by night-long snoring which may lead to marital discord and even complaints from neighbours. Symptoms on waking may be a headache and a feeling of not being refreshed by sleep. Sleepiness during the day can interfere with work and social activities and may produce risks to the patient and others if it occurs while operating dangerous machinery or driving. Over a longer time scale SAS results in intellectual and memory deterioration, a higher incidence of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension. Right heart failure is particularly likely if there is chronic airflow obstruction contributing to a low arterial oxygen level. Asystolic periods and tachyarrhythmias may occur during apnoeic periods. The increased mortality of SAS relates to coronary and cerebrovascular disease and arrhythmias. Sudden death occurs with greater frequency in patients with SAS, mainly at night.",

      "title": "Respiratory muscles: myths and secrets",
      "abstract": "1 Pulmonologist. Pulmonary Circulation Group/Pulmonary Function and Exercise Physiology Section, Department of Pulmonology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina – UNIFESP/EPM, Federal University of Sao Paulo/Paulista School of Medicine – Sao Paulo, Brazil Why is it so important that pulmonologists are familiar with respiratory muscle assessment? Respiratory muscle weakness is associated with increased respiratory workload and reduced or interrupted (central or peripheral) neural stimulation. In healthy individuals (in whom central respiratory drive is normal), the respiratory muscle strength required in order to drive the respiratory system must be greater than the sum of the work imposed by the lungs, rib cage, and airways.(1) An imbalance between the respiratory workload and respiratory muscle strength results in progressive respiratory muscle weakness, which can progress to alveolar hypoventilation and respiratory failure depending on its severity. In most cases, the inspiratory muscles (the most important of which is the diaphragm) are affected first, because of their active role in breathing.(2) Several diseases, particularly neuromuscular diseases, can affect the respiratory muscles. However, systemic inflammation (autoimmune rheumatic diseases), heart failure, and pulmonary impairment, observed in obstructive diseases with lung hyperinflation, in restrictive diseases, and in cases of rib cage deformities, can also adversely affect the respiratory muscles.(3) Therefore, respiratory muscle assessment can be one of the steps in the investigation of dyspnea of unknown cause or in the investigation of the clinical and functional dissociation in patients with chronic respiratory failure. In the initial evaluation of respiratory muscle strength, easily applied and widely available methods should be prioritized, overall evaluation of respiratory muscles being given priority over a more specific respiratory muscle assessment. Therefore, MIP and MEP measurements play a central role in the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory muscle strength. Values of MIP and MEP within the normal range rule out respiratory muscle weakness. However, low MIP and MEP values do not unequivocally confirm the presence of respiratory muscle weakness, because they might be related to technical problems or underexertion; therefore, further investigation is required in order to confirm the diagnosis. Steier et al.(4) showed that the use of MIP and MEP alone in the evaluation of patients with neuromuscular disease or patients with dyspnea of unknown cause can lead to overdiagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness, whereas a combination of methods reduces false-positive results by 30%. In the current issue of the Brazilian Journal of Pulmonology, Caruso et al.(5) present the various methods of respiratory muscle assessment. The division of the methods into volitional and nonvolitional respiratory muscle tests and their progressive sequencing (ranging from simple, noninvasive tests to tests that are more complex) facilitate the understanding of the tests and aid in choosing the test that is most suitable for the suspected diagnosis. It is of note that the authors addressed the increased use of diaphragmatic ultrasound in determining inspiratory muscle weakness. The advantage of ultrasound is that it requires equipment that is widely available, although it requires an operator who is familiar with the technique. Ultrasound can be used in order to evaluate diaphragmatic structure and function and can be performed in an outpatient or hospital setting.(5) However, certain diseases require methods that are more complex for an accurate diagnosis, including electrical or magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation and (surface or needle) electromyography, the latter being able to evaluate the diaphragm and different inspiratory and expiratory muscles separately.(2) It should be noted that respiratory muscle assessment can be performed in the pediatric population. However, volitional respiratory muscle testing is not feasible in infancy and early childhood in particular. Therefore, invasive techniques such as sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure during crying spells and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure are required and can be performed in children over 4 years of age.(6) Despite being outside the scope of the study by Caruso et al.,(5) tests such as pulmonary function",

La survenue d'une insuffisance respiratoire est en general progressive et insidieuse. Son diagnostic repose sur des examens cliniques et para-cliniques. Pour la plupart de ces pathologies, il n’existe aucun traitement curatif. Seule la ventilation mecanique associee a une prise en charge cardiaque adaptee permet, pour certaines pathologies, une survie prolongee avec une qualite de vie satisfaisante. Son indication au long cours peut se poser de differentes manieres : soit au decours d'une decompensation respiratoire aigue revelatrice de la maladie ou survenant en l'absence de suivi, soit de facon programmee (le cas le plus frequent) dans le cadre d’un suivi pluridisciplinaire. Les criteres d'indication retenus sont l’existence d’au moins un signe clinique evoquant une atteinte respiratoire, associee a une PaCO2 > 45 mmgH ou a une CV < 50% ou a une desaturation nocturne. Toutefois ces indications sont a nuancer en fonction de la pathologie et de la clinique.

Patients presented to the author after an episode of confusion, amnesia, or somnambulism. Legal defendants were being prosecuted for driving under the influence, and the author reviewed the cases as expert witness for the defense. Potential predisposing factors including comorbidities, social situation, physician instruction, concomitant medications, and patterns of medication management were considered.Patients and defendants exhibited abnormal behavior characterized by poor motor control and confusion. Although remaining apparently interactive with the environment, all reported amnesia for 3 to 5 hours. In some cases, the episodes began during daytime wakefulness because of accidental or purposeful ingestion of the zolpidem and are considered automatisms. Other cases began after ingestion of zolpidem at the time of going to bed and are considered parasomnias. Risk factors for both wake and sleep-related automatic complex behaviors include the concomitant ingestion of other sedating drugs, a higher dose of zolpidem, a history of parasomnia, ingestion at times other than bedtime or when sleep is unlikely, poor management of pill bottles, and living alone. In addition, similar size and shape of two medications contributed to accidental ingestion in at least one case.Sleep driving and other complex behaviors can occur after zolpidem ingestion. Physicians should assess patients for potential risk factors and inquire about parasomnias. Serious legal and medical complications can occur as a result of these forms of automatic complex behaviors.",

Results : The sleep of enuretic children, although polysomnographically quite normal, is exceedingly “deep”; that is enuretic children have high arousal thresholds. Apart from some overlap between enuresis and the (other) classic parasomnias, the sleep of enuretic children is no more problematic than that of the general population. Recently, the exciting possibility has arisen that the low arousability of enuretic children may be linked to the autonomous nervous system and to disturbances in the upper pons. Conclusions : Enuresis is not just a nocturnal problem but a disorder of sleep. The high arousal threshold is one of three major pathogenetic factors in enuresis—nocturnal polyuria and detrusor hyperactivity being the other two.",

Patients experience difficulty waking up in the morning and sleep drunkenness (a difficulty with waking), daytime sleepiness, an overwhelming urge to nap, and occasionally autonomic dysfunction. The symptoms of IH are characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, with non-refreshing prolonged naps and sleep drunkenness. Individuals with IH, despite sufficient and sometimes prolonged night sleep, experience reduced daytime alertness and, on awakening, feelings of sleep drunkenness. A careful review of the patient's history, comorbidities, and physical examination leads to the diagnosis of IH with or without long sleep time. Treatment parallels that of EDS in narcolepsy patients, but the response to medication is variable.",

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

Insomnia is not only a standalone disorder but also a contributing risk factor for other health issues, including diabetes, obesity, asthma, chronic pain syndrome, depression, anxiety disorders, and cardiovascular illnesses. Moreover, sleeplessness is frequently linked to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to the physical and mental health implications, insomnia also leads to impairments in daytime functioning and can greatly reduce an individual's quality of life.",

Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

Baseline investigations required for patients suffering with nocturia include: height and weight to calculate the body mass index; bladder diary, e.g. the ICIQ-Bladder Diary; quality of life questionnaire, e.g. ICIQ-N and ICIQ-NQoL; urinalysis, e.g. ‘dipstick’; flow rate and post-void residual measurement; and biochemical tests, e.g. renal electrolytes. Further urological investigations, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or imaging, are not indicated, unless an abnormality is suspected on baseline investigations and after failure of conservative and medical therapy. Patients are usually referred to the urologist for nocturia. However, following a thorough investigation, patients may need to be referred to another specialty. For example, if there is 24-hour polyuria, then the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist; if they have sleep disorders, such sleep apnoea (snoring, respiratory arrests), nocturnal seizures, parasomnias (nocturnal motor and behavioural phenomena), or excessive daytime sleepiness (sleep episodes, imperative sleepiness), then they should be referred for sleep evaluation studies. Similarly, if there are psychological problems, then the patient will need to be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications.

Obstructive sleep apnea in children has many different clinical features, compared with adults. In children, obstructive sleep apnea is mainly caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Other conditions such as obesity, craniofacial abnormality, and neuromuscular disease are also relevant predisposing factors. Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is associated with various secondary sequelae such as cognitive dysfunction, behavioral problem, attention deficit, reduced sleep-related quality of life and so on. The objective diagnostic test, standard polysomnograhy is often needed to diagnose and stratify the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, because subjective symptoms and signs related to obstructive sleep apnea are not always consistent with the severity of respiratory disturbance. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea should be diagnosed and treated, if clinically suspected, because various symptoms, signs and consequences can be improved with proper management. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment modality in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In addition, continuous positive airway pressure, rapid maxillary expansion, weight control, topical steroids, and antileukotrienes may be considered as adjuvant treatment options.",

Nurses have a role in the diagnosis and management of the condition through appropriate questioning, observation, advice on lifestyle choices, and support for treatment. The article also focuses on narcolepsy.",

During both drinking periods and withdrawal, alcoholics commonly experience problems falling asleep and decreased total sleep time. Other measures of sleep are also disturbed. Even alcoholics who have been abstinent for short periods of time (i.e., several weeks) or extended periods of time (i.e., several years) may experience persistent sleep abnormalities. Researchers also found that alcoholics are more likely to suffer from certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. Conversely, sleep problems may predispose some people to developing alcohol problems. Furthermore, sleep problems may increase the risk of relapse among abstinent alcoholics.",

Eine hyperdopaminerge Dysbalance kann bei einer Behandlung mit Dopaminagonisten auftreten oder beim Dopamin-Dysregulationssyndrom. Impulskontrollstörungen wie Hypersexualität, Essattacken, Kaufzwang und das pathologische Glücksspiel sind neben dem Punding typische Symptome einer hyperdopaminergen Verhaltensstörung. Kontrollierte Therapiestudien zur Behandlung dieser Störungen sind rar und die Therapie muss auf den individuellen Fall abgestimmt sein.

      "abstract": "• Fourteen patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were studied with all-night sleep EEG recordings. Nine of these patients reported abnormal sleep patterns before the polygraphic study. Analysis of the sleep records disclosed significantly decreased total sleep time with more awakenings, less stage 4 sleep, decreased rapid-eye-movement (REM) efficiency, and shortened REM latency compared with those of a group of age-and sex-matched normal subjects. These abnormalities generally resembled those of an age-matched group of depressed patients, although significant differences remained. These findings suggest that such sleep abnormalities as shortened REM latency may not be entirely specific for primary affective illness. They also point to a possible biological link between OCD and affective illness.",

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Funstional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2.Vascular algi originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migraine-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias preciously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease).3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, from, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examination which would only delay treatement and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at lenght and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychlogical examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

      "title": "Daytime Sleepiness and Sleep Attacks in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of disturbed sleep in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) approaches 100% (1). Sleep abnormalities include decrements in total sleep time, sleep spindling, stages 3 and 4 slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye-movement (REM)-sleep accompanied by sleep fragmentation and poor sleep efficiency (2,3). As primary sleep disorders, which interfere similarly with sleep, are associated with pathological levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), EDS might be expected to be relatively commonplace in PD. Suprisingly, EDS in PD has received little prior attention. Only quite recently has subjective (4,5) and objective (6–8) documentation of EDS and intrusion of REM-sleep into daytime naps in PD rekindled interest and a decades-long debate as to whether dopamine (DA) participates in behavioral state control, and if it does, what its role(s) might be. Current heuristic models of behavioral state control have restricted themselves to prominent roles for acetylcholine and other monoamines (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine). Exclusion of DA from these models derives largely from an inability to reconcile acknowledged influences of exogenous DA upon behavioral state with reported invariability of endogeneous DA activity across unique behavioral states. Lacking a comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates DA in a sleep—wake state or circadian rhythm modulation, clinical recognition of thalamocortical arousal impairments in PD has been met with surprise and no single parsimonious explanation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that wake (i.e., a thalamocortical-aroused state characterized by electroencephalography [EEG] desynchronization) is strongly influenced by DA (9–11).",

There is clinicopathological and genetic overlap with frontotemporal dementia, and an emerging view of ALS as a syndrome [1]. The majority of patients present with either focal limb or bulbar muscle weakness, which then spreads at a variable rate to other body regions [2]. Median survival in ALS is 30 months from symptom onset, with most deaths associated with type II respiratory failure [3]. In the majority of ALS patients, respiratory failure emerges insidiously after a variable period of progressive limb or bulbar muscle weakness. Symptoms are highly variable, but include breathlessness, often with orthopnoea, sleep fragmentation (with nocturnal desaturations detectable on oximetry), daytime somnolence and other systemic symptoms associated with chronic hypercapnia.
