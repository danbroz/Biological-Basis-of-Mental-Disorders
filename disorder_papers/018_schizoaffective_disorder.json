      "title": "Brief Psychotic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders that have no medical or pharmacological causes are divided into depressive disorders (unipolar, or major depressive disorder) and bipolar disorders. In bipolar disorders, both depressive and manic episodes occur sequentially. A manic episode is characterised as an abnormally excited mood that is experienced by a patient for a distinct period (at least a week). Diagnosis of mania requires that a patient’s work and social life be significantly affected, or that the patient needs hospitalisation. Diagnosis also requires the presence of three or more of the following symptoms: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased need for sleep; increased talkativeness; racing thoughts/ideas; distraction; increased goal-directed activity; excessive involvement in pleasurable activities [1].",

      "title": "Schizoaffective Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "he dependence of the clinical picture of acute psychosis connected with alcohol withdrawal from the forms of alcohol consumption",
      "abstract": "210 patients with acute psychotic disorder in a state of alcohol withdrawal were examined. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders according to DSM V, like all other psychiatric disorders, are still based\r\n on the description and grouping of symptoms. The emotional state can change in two\r\n directions: an elevated mood (which can oscillate from hypomania to mania) and lower\r\n mood (depression). For diagnosing mood disorder, it is essential to have a more\r\n comprehensive diagnostic formulation. The role plays careful observation and identifying\r\n the symptoms, which are used as the most important method for diagnosing mood\r\n disorders. There must be diagnostic criteria for each disease to determine the spectrum of\r\n symptoms occurring in the disease, but it is also important that there are minimal\r\n symptoms when deciding which diagnosis will be given to the patient. In the patient\r\n besides the main mental problem, the appearance of other illnesses, such as the\r\n circumstances that have arisen in the patient's life, and in the working and social\r\n environment, must be considered. We set the mood disorder diagnosis based on anamnesis,\r\n clinical picture, and course of the disease. In basic symptoms of depression, there is a loss\r\n of interest in, until then, important things and activities. The disturbances must last at least\r\n two weeks in order to be a depressive episode. Along with the symptoms that are\r\n compulsory, there are also symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite, sense of worth and /\r\n or guilt, deconcentration, helplessness, indecision, and suicidal thoughts until attempted\r\n suicide. Patients can become so frozen that they can not show the usual emotions, such as\r\n sorrow, joy or pleasure, or they may feel that the world around them without color and life\r\n is dead. The main symptoms that characterize mania are elevated mood, increased energy\r\n and activity. These patients experience graceful ideas, they think they have tremendous\r\n power, they think they can change the whole world. One of the picture of the disease that\r\n can occur in manic patients is the appearance of interpersonal conflicts, which can lead to\r\n paranoid treatment of reality. Pharmacological and psychological therapy gives the best\r\n results, and it is important to emphasize to the patient and family that the therapy does not\r\n have immediate effect, but that the therapy should take about two to six weeks for the drug\r\n / drugs to take effect. The patient should be monitored permanently and analyzed the\r\n results achieved. If the desired results have not been reached, it is necessary to change the\r\n approach and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "title": "Aportaciones de aripiprazol en el tratamiento de pacientes agudos con esquizofrenia.",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech.

The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "title": "Managing antiepileptic drug, Starting, Changing and Stopping AED’s",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours apart, one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years, diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Briefer (4 days or more), mild episodes of mood elevation define bipolar II disorder; lengthier (7 days or more), more severe episodes (or those requiring hospitalisation), with or without psychotic features, define bipolar I disorder. Depressive periods are more common and lengthier than manic or hypomanic states, and are the main cause of disability. Bipolar depression may respond poorly to antidepressants and these medications may destabilise the illness. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be considered when a patient with depression is treatment resistant. Irritability is a common symptom in bipolar disorder, particularly during mixed states (during which patients have features of mood elevation and depression concurrently) or when there is rapid cycling of mood (more than four episodes of mood disorder per year). Alcohol misuse and use of illicit drugs may simulate mood changes in bipolar disorder. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of bipolar disorder is essential for clinical decision making and determining prognosis and treatments.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

El tratamiento farmacologico es necesario, pero para tener una respuesta eficaz hay que combatir tambien con diversos problemas de indole social, psicoeducacion, tecnicas sociales y de afrontamiento y rehabilitacion, en una red de salud mental formada por equipos interdisciplinares. EnglishSchizophrenia is a serious psychotic disorder. It manifests itself with a variety of characteristic signs and symptoms. These symptoms affect perception (hallucinations), ideation, reality check (delusions), thought processes (lax associations), feelings (flat affect, inappropriate affect), attention, concentration, motivation, and judgment. There are no symptoms that alone are pathognomonic for schizophrenia. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are classified as positive, negative (or deficit) and disorganization. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.5%. It affects both sexes in a similar way. This disease is usually chronic in nature and can be characterized by three phases (acute phase, stabilization phase and stable phase) that merge with each other without there being any clear and absolute limits between them. Pharmacological treatment is necessary, but in order to have an effective response, it is also necessary to combat various problems of a social nature, psychoeducation, social techniques and coping and rehabilitation, in a mental health network made up of interdisciplinary teams.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "title": "TWO CASES OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS DEVELOPING AFTER SEVERE MENTAL EMOTION AND SHOCK",
      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "title": "Defining the brief, acute and transient psychotic disorders: the polymorphic psychotic core",
      "abstract": "Both APA and WHO try to define 'Brief Psychoses' and 'Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder', respectively, by using the time factor (duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day, but less than 1 month) as well as the cultural aspect (a symptom is not included if it is a culturally sanctioned response pattern, see p.) and by the exclusion of the effects of a substance or of general medical conditions. The WHO tries to achieve homogeneity on the one hand by using similar exclusion criteria like those of DSM-IV (time factor, organic cause, etc.), but on the other by defining subgroups (see p. 7ff). The first way, the time factor, however, applied by the WHO is somewhat more complicated than that of the APA. The first time factor used by the WHO concerns the development of symptoms (the time-interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks). And the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the type of the subgroup: the total duration of the disorder in the subgroups with schizophrenic symptoms (F23.1: Acute Polymorphic Psychotic Disorders with Symptoms of Schizophrenia, F23.2: Acute Schizophrenia-like Psychotic Disorders) must not exceed 1 month. This is also valid for the unspecified type (F23.8).",

MDD is characterised by periods of depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure that lasts at least two weeks. These symptoms are accompanied by a number of somatic symptoms (changes in sleep, libido, energy and vigour, appetite and psychomotor function, etc) as well as cognitive symptoms (feelings of worthlessness, concentration or decision making difficulty, poor concentration and suicidal thoughts) that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of everyday functionality.",

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "A psychiatric emergency is acute behavioral disturbance requiring urgent intervention, manifesting with mood, thought disorder or behavioral signs and symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

The mood disorders we will discuss are: depression or unipolar depression, manic-depression or bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder, and cyclothymic disorder. There are two major types of depression. In the first, depression or unipolar depression, the patient’s mood varies between being either normal or depressed; he or she never becomes excessively elated. In the second, manic-depression or bipolar illness, the patient’s mood varies between being depressed (as in unipolar depression) and being “high” or “euphoric.”",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nMental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in\r\nThinking, mood or behavior associated with distress. Mental & behavioral\r\nDisorders account for 12% of the global burden of the disease. In India, the\r\nPrevalence of mental illnesses have estimated to be about 65/10001.Of which\r\nSchizophrenia & mood disorders are the most disabling disorders in the\r\nCategory.\r\nSchizophrenia is a clinical syndrome of variable but profoundly disruptive\r\nPsychopathology that involves cognition, emotion, perception & other aspects\r\nOf behavior. The prevalence of Schizophrenia is reported to be 2.3-3/1000.\r\nBipolar affective disorder is an episodic illness in which episodes of\r\nDepression/mania/mixed/hypomania occur. BPAD s are dimensional illnesses in\r\nWhich patients experience during long term course of illness, fluctuating levels\r\nOf severity if manic & depressive symptoms interspersed with symptom free\r\nPeriods2. The current prevalence of BPAD is 0.4 –o.5% ;1 year prevalence is\r\n0.5-1.4% & lifetime prevalence is 2.6-7.8%.3 In India ,the prevalence of\r\nAffective disorder ranges from 0.51/thousand population4. Quality of life is\r\nEssentially understood as a wholesome concept, encompassing all the spheres of\r\nLife such as physical ,emotional ,material ,social well being ,development and\r\nActivity and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity.QOL can help the\r\nClinical care in the assessment impact of the illness and its treatment\r\n,functioning & well being. Quality of life is essentially understood in terms of\r\nPsychosocial wellbeing and the perception of one’s own life situations.\r\nIn his work, on the quality of life by Sullivan G, he noted the severe\r\nPsychosocial deficits experienced by the people with mental illnesses and their\r\nVulnerability to stress. Decline in the quality of life, especially in the domains of\r\nEnvironment, social relationships & employment were reported among the\r\nPeople with psychiatric disorders 5.\r\nAccording to international classification of impairment, Disability &\r\nHandicap (ICDH ,1980),Disability is defined as interference with activities of\r\nThe whole person in relation to the immediate environment 6 .Within the ambit\r\nOf definition of disability under the persons with disabilities act 1995,mental\r\nIllness means a disorder of the mind that results in partial/complete disturbance\r\nIn thinking ,feeling & behavior which may also result in recurrent /persistent\r\nInability or reduced ability7.\r\nGiven the magnitude and pervasiveness of the impairments associated with\r\nSchizophrenia ,(Tandon et al)8 only limited effectiveness of existing treatments\r\nAnd the prevalence of stigma , people with schizophrenia commonly experience\r\nA wide and diverse array of psychosocial difficulties reaching far beyond the\r\nSymptoms of the disease9.\r\nSchizophrenia is associated with various physical abnormalities (eg. Enlarged\r\nVentricles and sulci , neuronal disarray ,excess of dopamine ,and reduced frontal\r\nBlood flow) and psychological abnormalities (eg. Hallucinations , delusions,\r\nDisorganized cognition ,and basic cognitive disturbances ,including input\r\n,memory and abstraction).These abnormalities (i.e. Impairments)may lead to\r\nVarious difficulties (i.e., activity limitations)for persons with schizophrenia,\r\nIncluding the inability to speak in coherent sentences ,to concentrate ,and to\r\nRemember and organize details. Without some or all of these abilities, an\r\nIndividual with schizophrenia will have great difficulty meeting certain public\r\nServices. Such contextual issues as stigma and impaired social support networks\r\nCan exacerbate participation restrictions by limiting access to resources and\r\nOpportunities.\r\nBipolar affective disorder has been found to be associated with the\r\nFollowing types of disability: increased suicidal behavior, higher\r\nUnemployment, higher dependence on public assistance, lower annual income,\r\nIncreased work absenteeism owing to illness, decreased work productivity\r\n,poorer overall functioning, lower quality of life and decreased life span10.\r\nBurden is defined as presence of problems, difficulties or adverse events\r\nWhich affect the ( lives) of the psychiatric patient ‘s significant others11.\r\nFamilies of patients with mental illness face stigmatization, long term\r\nEconomical and emotional burden taking care of the patient. Illness in the\r\nPatient has impact on work, social relationship and leisure activities of the\r\nFamily members. This evokes different feelings in the family members, which\r\nCan have an impact on the course and prognosis of the illness12.\r\nThe concept of Quality of life, disability and burden are interrelated. These\r\nConcepts have received more attention with the advent of newer drugs and better\r\nTherapeutic outcome among the patients. Thus it is more prudent to concentrate\r\nOn these factors to help the patients, make a constructive living.\r\n\r\nAIM:\r\nTo assess the differences in the quality of life and disability among patients with\r\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorders and to study the burden of care among their\r\nCaregivers\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n To assess the quality of life in persons with schizophrenia in comparison\r\nWith bipolar disorder.\r\n To evaluate the disability among persons with schizophrenia in\r\nComparison with bipolar disorder.\r\n To describe the burden of care among the caregivers of persons with\r\nSchizophrenia in comparison with bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality.

      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is considered as a qualitatively distinct form among the anxiety disorders. Follow-up studies have demonstrated that the course of panic disorder may be chronic. Only one out of ten patients remains completely free of symptoms within an observational period of 3 to 7 years. The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death. It is not clear whether this is due to the frequent comorbidity between panic disorder, major depression, and substance abuse.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

To make the diagnosis there must be abnormalities in either or both attention and activity which are excessive compared with the norm for a child of that age or developmental level, have been present from an early age (at least seven years but often identifiable by three years) and are pervasive, ie present in more than one area of a child's life (home, school, social situations etc). Medically the status of this diagnos is is that of a syndrome or disorder, not a disease, and none of the described behaviours is exclusive to the diagnosis. It also presents as a spectrum disorder, with less and more severe degrees, but it should be noted that the DSM IV classification requires evidence of clinically significant impairment of function. There are three main groups of symptoms: overactivity, inattentivenes and impulsivity.",

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component but non-genetic factors (substance abuse, urbanicity, migration, advanced paternal age, and obstetric complications) make a significant contribution. Antipsychotic medication is the most effective intervention for symptom control and relapse prevention. Psychoeducation and psychological and vocational interventions are important adjunctive components of care.",

Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

Severe forms constitute a psychiatric emergency, demanding immediate control including rapid tranquillization with medication. Treatment lessens the severity and shortens the duration of manic episodes, which in the pretreatment era was usually 3 to 12 months with a mean of 26 weeks. In one modern series, remission from mania occurred in 50% of manic episodes by 12 weeks (1). After the first episode of mania, the mean latency to recovery was 13.7 weeks and the median 5.4 weeks in terms of the DSM-defined syndrome of mania; 97% had recovered within two years, but only 35% had recovered in terms of personal and occupational functioning (2).

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

Se desconoce la causa exacta, pero puede estar implicado la herencia, cambios en las concentraciones de los neurotransmisores cerebrales y factores psicologicos. El diagnostico se basa en la anamnesis. Es un trastorno del estado de animo, en el que los pacientes presentan ciclos alternantes de elevacion o exaltacion (mania o hipomania) o de apagamiento o depresion (1).\r\nEl trastorno bipolar tipicamente comienza en la adolescencia o durante la temprana adultez y continua a traves de toda la vida. Frecuentemente no es reconocida como una enfermedad y las personas que tienen la enfermedad pueden sufrir innecesariamente por anos o por decadas (2).\r\nLa enfermedad bipolar ha sido diagnosticada en ninos(as) menores de 12 anos de edad, aunque no es comun durante esta etapa de la ninez. Puede ser confundida con el trastorno del deficit de la atencion y del comportamiento perturbador, por lo tanto, un diagnostico cuidadoso es necesario (3).\r\nEste trastorno afecta a alrededor de 60 millones de personas en todo el mundo. Se suele caracterizar por la alternancia de episodios maniacos y depresivos separados por periodos de estado de animo normal. Durante los episodios de mania, el paciente presenta un estado de animo exaltado o irritable, hiperactividad, verborrea, autoestima elevada y una disminucion de la necesidad de dormir. Las personas que presentan solamente episodios maniacos y no sufren fases depresivas tambien se clasifican dentro del diagnostico de trastorno bipolar (4).\r\nExisten medicamentos que estabilizan el estado de animo con los que se puede detener eficazmente las fases agudas del trastorno bipolar y prevenir las recidivas.

      "abstract": "La comorbilidad de trastornos de ansiedad y TUS es muy frecuente en el campo de la patologia. Ambos trastornos pueden ser primarios, el trastorno de ansiedad puede ser secundario (inducido) al consumo de drogas, o viceversa. El DSM-IV-TR1 describe 12 trastornos de ansiedad y 10 trastornos de ansiedad inducidos. Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

In the given patients' group, alcoholism manifested itself atypically. The initial lack of the protective nauseous and vomiting reflex and high tolerance, relative preservation of the quantitative control, no amnesia during drunkenness, temporal break between the formation of compulsive addiction and the abstinent syndrome, manifestation of compulsive addiction only in a state of alcoholic intoxication were recorded. At the same time attention should be drawn to the frequently occurring depressive forms of drunkenness, early appearance of the asthenic state, the lack of marked personality changes by the alcoholic type, relative preservation of a critical attitude towards the disease, and to the abortive abstinent syndrome, characterized sometimes by an elevated attitude of mind resembling the hypomaniacal state. Alcoholism tends towards a moderate progredient course, which is often not realized because of the influence of psychic trauma and in that case alcoholism takes a malignant course.",

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "title": "Managing bipolar disorder in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is relatively common, at least twice as common as schizophrenia, and eminently treatable. It is also perfectly suited to the well established outpatient model practised in general practice and psychiatry. All GP practices should include people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on their case register of people with severe mental illness. It is not possible to exclude a bipolar diagnosis categorically if there are only symptoms of depression. Most patients will have had a (hypo)manic episode by their 30s. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar affective disorder proper is 1%, with a further 1.2% presenting with milder hypomanic symptoms (so-called bipolar II disorder). Relaxing diagnostic symptom criteria increases the frequency of depressed patients who develop symptoms of mania for any length of time to 50%. The lifetime course of the illness tends to be dominated by depressive episodes: half the time is estimated to be spent in the euthymic (well) state, 12% in a manic state and 38% in a depressed state. Any depressed patient should be asked about periods in the past when (s)he has been elated in mood, found it unnecessary to sleep, talked a lot, spent excessive amounts of money etc. Treatment for bipolar disorder has to be divided into: treatment of mania, treatment of bipolar depression and prophylaxis of mood swings in either direction. Antidepressant treatments are unlikely to help manic symptoms, at worst they can precipitate or aggravate them. Antimanic treatments are unlikely to help symptoms of depression but an exception to this rule would be a genuine mood stabiliser, such as lithium. Patients with bipolar disorder should have an annual physical health review. This will include monitoring for weight gain, lipid levels, plasma glucose levels, smoking status and alcohol use, as well as blood pressure.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "title": "Análise da prevalência de Síndrome Metabólica e fatores de risco associados em pacientes com Esquizofrenia Refratária",
      "abstract": "APRESENTACAO: A esquizofrenia e uma doenca cronica, incapacitante, que afeta mais de 21 milhoes de pessoas em todo o mundo. E concebida, na atualidade, como um transtorno mental persistente e complexo, caracterizado por um conjunto de sinais e sintomas que incluem discurso e comportamento desorganizados, delirios, alucinacoes e alteracao na cognicao. O tratamento baseia-se, essencialmente, no uso de medicamentos denominados antipsicoticos, associados a terapias psicossociais. Cerca de 30% das pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia nao apresentam melhora do quadro clinico, sendo denominadas refratarias ou resistentes ao tratamento. Os diferentes mecanismos fisiopatologicos desse transtorno podem estar envolvidos em sua etiologia. Apesar de nao existir um consenso unico e globalmente aceito, a esquizofrenia refrataria pode ser caracterizada quando nao ha melhora dos principais sintomas apos o tratamento com dois antipsicoticos de classes diferentes (sendo pelo menos um atipico), em doses adequadas, durante um determinado periodo de tempo (4-6 ou 6-8 semanas). O tratamento medicamentoso de escolha, para os casos de esquizofrenia resistente (ou refrataria), e a prescricao do antipsicotico atipico clozapina. Ja a Sindrome metabolica (SM) caracteriza-se por um conjunto de fatores de risco para diabetes mellitus do tipo 2 e doencas cardiovasculares, tendo como componentes centrais a obesidade abdominal, resistencia a insulina, dislipidemia e hipertensao. Alem disso, tambem esta associada ao desenvolvimento de doencas hepaticas, respiratorias, osteoarticulares e câncer. Em pacientes com esquizofrenia, estima-se que, aproximadamente, 34% das mortes entre pessoas do sexo masculino e 31% naquelas do sexo feminino sejam atribuidas a doenca cardiovascular, o que so e superado pelo suicidio. Desta forma, apresenta-se como uma condicao complexa que acarreta alto custo social e economico para os sistemas de saude e familias, atingindo todas as populacoes do mundo. Pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia apresentam um risco aumentado para alteracoes metabolicas, em comparacao ao da populacao geral. Este artigo foi elaborado com o objetivo de estimar a prevalencia de sindrome metabolica (SM) e os fatores associados, segundo as variaveis sociodemograficas, clinicas e comportamentais em pacientes com esquizofrenia refrataria em uso de clozapina. METODOLOGIA: Foi realizado um estudo de delineamento transversal na Regiao Ampliada Oeste do Estado de Minas Gerais (MG). A populacao foi composta por 169 pessoas que constavam no cadastro da Superintendencia Regional de Saude (SRS) dessa regiao, com diagnostico medico de esquizofrenia refrataria que estavam em uso do antipsicotico atipico clozapina, maiores de 18 anos, de ambos os sexos e com capacidade de entendimento. O calculo amostral foi realizado, utilizando-se o programa OpenEpi, versao 3.03a, considerando-se uma populacao de 169 individuos para uma proporcao esperada do evento de 50%, um nivel de significância de 5% e margem de erro de 10%, estimando-se uma amostra de, aproximadamente, 62 individuos. A amostra final foi composta por todos os pacientes que compareceram ao CAPS de Divinopolis, durante o periodo de coleta de dados (dezembro de 2014 a junho de 2015), totalizando-se 72 individuos. Foram excluidas do estudo as mulheres gravidas, os participantes que nao estavam em jejum e aqueles que apresentaram qualquer condicao que pudesse interferir na coleta e mensuracao dos dados. O projeto foi aprovado pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa com Seres Humanos da Universidade Federal de Sao Joao Del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu (UFSJ/CCO) sob o parecer 572.288. Foram coletados dados sociodemograficos, clinicos, antropometricos e bioquimicos. O processamento e a analise dos dados foram realizados por meio do programa Statistical Package for the Social Science®, versao 20.0. As variaveis foram descritas por meio de suas frequencias absolutas e relativas. Para a comparacao dos pacientes com e sem sindrome metabolica, foram utilizados os testes de Qui-Quadrado de Pearson e exato de Fischer. Na analise multivariada, para avaliar os fatores associados a SM, foi utilizado o modelo de regressao logistica binaria. Para a entrada das variaveis preditoras no modelo, foi considerado um valor-p menor que 0,20 na analise univariada. Utilizou-se o criterio forward para a entrada das variaveis no modelo e para a permanencia delas no modelo final foi adotado um nivel de 5% de significância. Apos ajuste do modelo final, foi avaliada a estimativa do OddsRatio ajustado com o respectivo intervalo de confianca de 95% (IC 95%). O ajuste do modelo foi avaliado por meio da estatistica de Hosmer& Lemeshow. Observou-se prevalencia de SM em 47,2% da amostra, com predominio entre as mulheres (58,8%). Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram percentuais mais elevados de alteracoes, em todos os componentes. As razoes para essa elevada prevalencia ainda e muito controversa, principalmente em funcao da possivel participacao dos medicamentos antipsicoticos na genese das anormalidades metabolicas. A esquizofrenia, por si so, ja representa um fator de risco para as anormalidades que compoem a SM e, neste contexto, as medicacoes atipicas ou de segunda-geracao, estando entre elas a clozapina, possuem um papel importante na potencializacao do risco. A relacao precisa entre o uso de medicacoes antipsicoticas e o desenvolvimento de SM ainda permanece incerta, podendo-se afirmar, com clareza, que pessoas tratadas com esses medicamentos apresentam SM em uma frequencia superior a da populacao geral. A prevalencia de SM gira em torno de 4 a 26% nas pessoas que nao fazem uso desses medicamentos, chegando a 69% naqueles medicados. O uso de quatro ou mais medicamentos, sobrepeso e obesidade indicaram associacao significativa. Observa-se que a ingesta de varios medicamentos aumenta o risco para o aparecimento de efeitos adversos metabolicos, contribuindo, por conseguinte, para o desenvolvimento de SM. Um estudo que analisou o uso de mais de um psicotropico (politerapia), em comparacao a monoterapia, confirmou um risco aumentado para o desenvolvimento de alteracoes metabolicas e outras comorbidades. Deste modo, este achado deve ser visto com cuidado, considerando-se que pacientes que possuem esquizofrenia refrataria tendem a utilizar um numero maior de medicamentos em detrimento da gravidade da doenca e de sintomas diversos. Somando-se a isso, uma relacao causal mostra-se inviavel de ser estabelecida, tendo em vista a natureza deste estudo. Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram um historico de menos internacoes psiquiatricas, comparados aqueles que nao a possuem , sendo associado a SM na analise multivariada. A prevalencia de SM foi elevada, considerando-se que esta taxa representa um valioso indicador de saude e aponta para a necessidade de cuidado e atencao. Sugere-se que esses pacientes sejam continuamente monitorados clinicamente, tanto no inicio do tratamento com clozapina quanto no seu decorrer, por meio de avaliacoes frequentes de seu peso, circunferencia da cintura e pressao arterial, bem como realizacao de exames bioquimicos quanto aos componentes de SM. Alem disso, indica-se que eles sejam incluidos em grupos e outras estrategias de educacao em saude e de qualidade de vida nas unidades de saude. Para isso, e necessario que esse grupo de pacientes seja visto como prioritario pelos gestores e profissionais de saude, considerando-se a necessidade de vigilância continua desses fatores de risco para o estabelecimento de intervencoes precoces e efetivas.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a clinical anxiety disorder that is centrally characterized by excessive, pervasive, and chronic worry. Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

      "title": "Supplementary Material for: Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The clinical picture of alcohol withdrawal syndrome lies somewhere on a continuum that ranges from slight morning tremor to genuine delirium tremens. The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

The duration of untreated psychosis is the most studied variable and closely related to the assessment of the impact of early treatment on the patient's prognosis. Psychosis can be divided into primary (affective and non-affective) or secondary causes.

Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal sensory experiences, or hallucinations (e.g., hearing voices that are not there); odd beliefs not shared by those around you, or delusions (e.g., that one is being followed by the FBI or that one's thoughts can be heard by nearby people); loss of normal functions such as motivation and anticipating pleasure (i.e., negative symptoms); cognitive impairment; and problems in social functioning. It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or recurrent severe depressive illness, is, at best, a lifelong vulnerability and, at worst, a continuous chronic condition with serious associated disabilities.

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

Careful differential diagnosis is necessary in the cases of transient psychosis. Psychotic symptoms in overloaded individuals may be more common than was previously thought.",

      "abstract": "In DSM-5 the new category of dissociative disorders follows the trauma and stressor-related disorders category. Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

Several screening tools are available, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC). Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence.

Symptoms of SIPD include but are not limited to paranoia and hallucinations, negative symptoms, disinhibition or dreaminess, and/or sensations of heightened awareness. In cocaine use, there also exist paranoid delusions and hallucinations. While there is no definitive standard of treatment to address SIPD, management of such disorders tends to vary depending on substances used, clinical symptomatology, dosage, frequency, and chronicity, among other variables. Given that the relationship between SIPD and the development of several mental illnesses is well established, a long-term follow-up period is needed to identify, prevent, and effectively treat further relapses.

Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

This is a heterogeneous group of patients who have either a disorder similar to schizophrenia or something closer to a mood disorder. Objectives To analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of schizophreniform disorder and also review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of maintaining the treatment, because of the abandonment of the treatment, which is a predictor of relapses. Methods A review of the main impact literature concerning schizophreniform disorder is done during the last five years: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V are studied. Results The etiology is unknown. Psychotic symptoms can be treated with antipsychotics for 3 to 6 months. They usually respond faster than patients with schizophrenia (75% vs 20% respond within 8 days). Conclusions The disease has a favorable prognosis, and has similarities with mood disorders. However, some data suggest a close relationship to schizophrenia. In support of the relationship with mood disorders, patients have more affective symptoms and a better outcome than patients with schizophrenia. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Patients with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Depression is the third most common illness among patients with schizophrenia which negatively affects the course of the disease and significantly contributes to the mortality rate, due to increased suicide. Depression, along with negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, is one of the main factors that significantly decreases the quality of life and the disease prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, depression increases the frequency of exacerbations and readmissions, decreases the quality and duration of remissions and is associated with more frequent substance abuse and an increased economic burden. Data on the prevalence of depression among patients with schizophrenia are contradictory and are associated with a low detection rate of depression in such patients, a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and difficulties in differentiation between extrapyramidal and negative symptoms. The average prevalence of depression that meets the diagnostic criteria of major depressive episodes in patients with schizophrenia is 25% at a specific point, and 60% over the course of a lifetime; the frequency of subsyndromal depression is much higher. It is essential to distinguish between primary (axial syndrome) and secondary depressive symptoms (extrapyramidal symptoms, psychogenic or nosogenic reactions, social factors, etc.) to determine treatment strategies. The published data relating to randomized clinical trials for the development of evidence-based guidelines are limited. Current recommendations are based mainly on the results of small-scale trials and reviews. Certain atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, clozapine) are superior to typical antipsychotics in the reduction of depressive symptoms. Clozapine is effective in the management of patients at risk from suicide. The additional prescription of antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy are not always effective and are only possible following the management of acute psychosis in cases when antipsychotic monotherapy proved to be ineffective.",

Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found. We found signs of mind reading (Gedankenausbreitung).",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders.

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions.

      "abstract": "Overtraining syndrome is a condition of prolonged fatigue and decreased athletic performance caused by excessive training overload without adequate rest and recovery. Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

      "abstract": "Under observation there were 71 patients with reactive states developed in the presence of slowly progressing schizophrenia. Three types of the reactive depressions were distinguished: simple depressions following the line of psychogenically provoked endogenous phases; hysteric-type depressions, and reactive depressions with a polymorphous picture approaching schizophrenic reactions and being, in essence, psychogenically provoked schizophrenic episodes. It is shown that the level of the reactive lability and the time course of the reactive depressions is determined to a great measure by the degree of stabilization (or activity) of the endogenous process. In the period of stabilization (latent forms of schizophrenia, long-time remissions after an episode) the reactive states may be induced by a severe psychic trauma, and the time course of the depression, if the endogenous disturbances are added, remains within the limits of the phase. In the period of activation of the endogenous process the psychogenic depressions develop after relatively slight psychic traumas. In such cases, if the endogenous schizophrenic process is continuous, the reactive states become protracted and approach in their mechanisms to reactive development. In cases of \"schubweise\" schizophrenia the time course of the psychogenic reactions is confined to the limits of the episode.",

The anxiety may be sustained, but more often is episodic from a few minutes to hours or days. The chief symptoms are those of anxiety and its physical concomitants in the absence of other illness and independent of specific situations; they include breathing and swallowing difficulties, palpitations, dizziness, irritability, and faintness. Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients. The syndrome requires differentiation from depressive and phobic disorders and from physical conditions which produce anxiety.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Chronic Insomnia - it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more. Insomnia may be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Primary causes of insomnia include stress due to a job loss or change in bad habits. A secondary cause of insomnia includes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms and have been linked to disrupted sleep.

Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Un avis neurologique a ete demande, le diagnostic evoque est une psychose post-ictale, le traitement antiepileptique a ete ajuste, l evolution sous traitement fut favorable avec nettoyage totale de la symptomatologie psychotique au bout de 4jours. Le syndrome de PPI, s il est de bon pronostic a court terme, peut potentiellement evoluer vers d autres troubles psychiatriques de moins bon pronostic. Il est donc important a connaitre pour le clinicien, d autant que son traitement apparait relativement aise par rapport a celui d autres troubles psychotiques.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) belongs to the group of epilepsies with primarily generalized seizures as absence epilepsies, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as infantile and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a specifically an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive/uncontrollable and often irrational worry worrying, anxiety symptoms and tension about a variety of everyday problems, events or activities for a period of at least 6 months. Individuals with GAD often have other disorders including other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder), substance use disorder, obesity, and may have a history of trauma or family with GAD. As per Aacharya Charaka Generalized Anxiety Disorder can be correlated with the Chittodwega (Excited state of mind) which is type of Manovikara (disease of mind). The contemporary management of this disease employs anxiolytics to be used in long run which is not conducive to health. As per this view cannabis stands as ‘Holy Grail’ in the treatment of anxiety or mood disorders without eliciting any anxiogenic effects even in higher dose. This is a case of 57 year old women who presented with persistent anxiety and inability to relax. Based on signs and symptoms he was diagnosed as a case of GAD according to the ICD 10 F41.1 criteria. Treatment planned was low dose of oral medical cannabis tincture. Assessment of the condition of the patient before and after the treatment was done using Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale to evaluate efficacy of treatment. After the completion of schedule of 3 month of treatment, a significant reduction in score from 20 to 12 on Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale and improvement in symptoms was observed.",

      "abstract": "Se estudian, con el fin de valorar su utilidad diagnóstica, los síntomas de tipo somático que carecen de una base orgánica demostrable (síntomas hipocondríacos) en 152 enfermos depresivos mayores de 60 años ingresados en un Servicio Psico-Geriátrico de Londres. &#x0D; &#x0D; Más de la mitad de los enfermos (63,81%) presentaron estos síntomas. Esta cifra es mucho más elevada que la que se encuentra en enfermos depresivos más jóvenes y puede atribuirse al efecto patoplástico de la edad. El sexo del enfermo no guarda ninguna relación estadística con la frecuencia con que aparecen estos síntomas. &#x0D; &#x0D; Los síntomas hipocondríacos se manifestaron, solos, o acompañados de otros síntomas depresivos, desde el comienzo de la enfermedad en 72-casos (47,3%). En 45 (29,6%) precedieron a los síntomas depresivos clásicos, apareciendo entre 2 semanas y 9 meses antes que estos. &#x0D; &#x0D; Todos los enfermos con estos síntomas aparentemente somáticos, visitaron a su médico más de una vez con este motivo y 28 casos fueron investigados detalladamente en uno o más hospitales generales. En ninguno de estos 28 casos se hizo en estos hospitales una exploración psiquiátrica sencilla enfocada a descubrir una posible depresión, y únicamente se llegó al diagnóstico correcto después de que el enfermo se intentó suicidar o tuvo una crisis de agitación. &#x0D; &#x0D; Aproximadamente el 25% de los enfermos que presentaban síntomas hipocondríacos intentó suicidarse, mientras que entre los que no presentaban estos síntomas; únicamente el 3,28%.&#x0D; &#x0D; Se detallan las diversas localizaciones y características de estos síntomas. Los más frecuentes son los del aparato digestivo, entre los que descuella por su frecuencia e intensidad el estreñimiento. &#x0D; &#x0D; Concluye el autor indicando que es el médico general y no el psiquiatra quien suele ver a los enfermos geriátricos deprimidos en la etapa inicial de la enfermedad y a él incumbe hacer el diagnóstico. Se detallan las razones por las cuales es importante llegar a este diagnóstico precoz y se sugiere un esquema sencillo de exploración psiquiátrica que quizá pueda ayudar al médico general a excluir la posibilidad de una depresión.",

      "title": "Evaluación del efecto antidepresivo del secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas precondicionadas en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor",
      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

      "abstract": "Intermittent alcohol disorders are defined by the paroxystic aspect of alcohol consumption followed by periods of time without alcohol ingestion. The most typical form of intermittent alcoholism is dispomania. During the acute episode of dipsomania, the patient presents an extreme craving for alcohol and a complete loss of control. The alcohol consumption usually leads to severe overdoses and coma. The cases of pure dipsomania are relatively rare in daily practice. Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine. These patients use alcohol like a drug in order to get a modification of the conscience, a high, a sedation or a trip.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

The term asthenia comes from the Greek (¢sqsneia, a: privation, without; esthenos: vigor, force), it means absence of strength, vigor or force. It is a symptom, difficult to define, with a set of vague sensations, different for each patient. It is a frequent cause of consult, almost 30% in ambulatory settings. The chronic fatigue represents up to 10% of these cases, and the 0.2-0.7% belongs to the chronic fatigue syndrome. It is very important to differentiate asthenia from weakness, dizziness or dyspnoea, since patients may confuse them. The factor time in asthenia is very useful for its characterization, it was defined to the prolonged fatigue when it lasts for more than a month and chronic when the duration is greater than 6 months. The depression is the commonest fatigue cause, representing ap- proximately half of the cases. The most effective treatment of the asthenia is to solve the underlying cause, although up to 20% of the patients remain without diagnosis. The diagnosis of the chronic fatigue syndrome is of exclusion and the criteria of the international consensus of year 1994 are due to use. The high frequency of the symptom entails an enormous social and economic cost and it is for that reason so important for physicians to have a correct manage of this symptom.",

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "title": "Lack of Insight in Bipolar Disorder: The Impact on Treatment Adherence, Adverse Clinical Outcomes and Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Insight is a multidimensional construct, defined as the awareness of having a mental disorder, of specific symptoms and their attribution to the disorder, the awareness of social consequences, and of need for treatment. Although insight has been studied specifically in schizophrenia and its study in mood disorders has traditionally received limited attention, the evaluation of this concept in mood disorders is also very important because of the impact on treatment compliance and outcome. In bipolar disorder (BD), clinical insight varies substantially over time. Most researchers observed that insight is more impaired during an illness episode than during remission, in mixed than in pure manic episodes, in bipolar II than in bipolar I patients, and in pure mania than in bipolar or unipolar depression. Lack of insight is a consistent factor of non-adherence to medication in bipolar patients, along with severity of BD, side effects of medication, effectiveness, and patient-related factors. Also, impaired insight into treatment and a great number of previous hospitalizations are associated with poorer clinical outcomes (psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, violent or suicidal behavior) among the patients with bipolar I disorder. In the management of bipolar disorder, improving quality of life (QoL) and outcome should be one the most important goals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychotic phenomena are not exclusive to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, nor are they contained entirely within the broader category of primary psychotic disorders Trauma-associated symptoms, dissociative disorders, borderline and paranoid personality disorder, grief, delirium, or psychologically mediated phenomena need to be considered when developing a psychiatric differential for psychotic symptoms. The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis canbe difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially,he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and internal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active temporal focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

De emotionele en maatschappelijke gevolgen kunnen achteraf groot blijken te zijn. Bij een welbespraakte patient wordt de ernst van de manie vaak onderschat. Mensen in de omgeving zijn eerder gealarmeerd dan de patient zelf, en dienen dus altijd bij de behandeling betrokken te worden. De multidisciplinaire behandeling is primair medicamenteus, naast interventies om het ongeremde gedrag te begrenzen en de patient te beschermen tegen zichzelf. Vaak is een al dan niet vrijwillige opname nodig. De afgrenzing van schizoaffectieve psychotische stoornissen is onscherp.

      "title": "Bipolar and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Bipolar disorders feature a distinct period of mania or hypomania. For example, a patient might develop a relatively acute onset of euphoria, diminished need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and a variety of behavioral indiscretions. Absent complicating factors, such a patient would likely be readily identified as having a manic episode as part of bipolar I disorder. Complicating factors abound in diagnosing bipolar and related disorders, however, which is one reason that this chapter features an abundance of cases. Most of the complications relate to symptom evaluation. DSM-5 identified seven symptoms that tend to cluster in bipolar I disorder, and the diagnosis of mania requires three of these symptoms. Each of the symptoms requires clinical judgment in regard to both duration and intensity, and certain problems, such as \"distractibility\" and \"reduced need for sleep,\" are not always obvious during a clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of mania requires that symptoms from this cluster persist for most of the day, every day, for at least a week. This standard requires an accurate history, which can be difficult to obtain from any patient, but particularly from a patient who may have little insight into the presence of a psychiatric problem (as is often the case for individuals with bipolar disorder). An accurate bipolar history is even more difficult to obtain when the presenting symptom is depression, and manic symptoms might not have been present for many years. Half of patients with bipolar disorder use illicit substances, which can complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Depression is so commonly found in bipolar disorder that the disorder was previously called \"manic depression.\" The relationship between the two mood states is not always clear, however, which is one reason that bipolar and related disorders were shifted into a separate chapter in DSM-5. As it turns out, depression can be absent in bipolar disorder, but it can also be the dominant mood state in regard to both frequency and intensity of symptoms. Mood can oscillate between the two poles of depression and mania, or the two can coexist (e.g., a mood episode with mixed features). The relationship between the depressive and manic symptoms is made even more complicated by the reality that patients are more likely to spontaneously complain about dysphoria than about euphoria. Finally, as is generally the case for disorders throughout DSM-5, a bipolar diagnosis requires impairment. Some of the core symptoms of mania—increased activity, euphoria, and talkativeness—can lead to increased effectiveness and pleasure, at least in the short term, which further complicates the assessment. DSM-5 addressed these uncertainties by describing multiple syndromes within the bipolar spectrum. For example, diagnoses of mania and hypomania both require \"three of seven listed criteria, most of the day, nearly every day.\" However, mania requires at least one episode lasting at least 7 days, whereas hypomania requires only a 4-day duration. Instead of requiring a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, as specified for mania, hypomania requires an unequivocal change from baseline that is observable by others. These criteria take into consideration the reality that manic and hypomanic patients often lack insight, and the criteria emphasize that hypomania is less severe than mania. Hypomania is a key feature of DSM-5 bipolar II disorder. A second distinguishing feature of bipolar II disorder is the requirement for at least one major depressive episode at a time when hypomanic symptoms are not present. This requirement is in contrast to bipolar I disorder, which does not require the historical presence of depression. Other patients may have classic manic or hypomanic symptoms but with an apparent physiological precipitant. For example, a patient may have developed manic symptoms immediately after receiving prednisone, a steroid, for a flare-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). In this case, the clinician might conclude that the patient has bipolar disorder, which would presumably warrant a mood-stabilizing medication. Alternatively, the patient may have had a fairly common reaction to steroids and warrant a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar disorder (a disorder commonly and inaccurately labeled \"steroid psychosis\"); if so, a likely treatment would be reduction of the steroid medication. The patient's symptoms may, however, be best conceptualized as neuropsychiatric lupus, which in DSM-5 would be called bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. In that case, however, the patient might be best treated by an increase in steroids. One reason that the bipolar diagnosis is so hotly contested is that making the correct diagnosis is vitally important for patient care. The bipolar spectrum also includes clusters of individuals whose mania-related symptoms are significant but who do not meet criteria for bipolar I or II disorder by virtue of the number or duration of symptoms. For example, some patients have a chronic course of alternating hypomanic and subthreshold depressive symptoms. To reach the diagnostic threshold for DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, these symptoms need to be distressing and persistent (more days than not for at least 2 years—1 year in adolescents—with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and the individual should never have met criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode. DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder is quite parallel to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder in regard to both duration and intensity of symptoms. Other patients have significant manic symptoms, but an adequate history is not elicited because of the situation (e.g., an emergency room visit); in such cases, the diagnosis would be unspecified bipolar and related disorder. A variety of other patients are diagnosed with other specified bipolar and related disorder. These include people whose manic symptoms either persist for an inadequate duration (e.g., only 2–3 days rather than the required 4 days) or persist for greater than 4 days but do not meet the three of seven symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Still others meet criteria for hypomania but lack a history of major depressive disorder and therefore do not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. Others have chronic hypomania and subthreshold depressive symptoms but do not meet the 24-month criterion for cyclothymia. Bipolar spectrum diagnoses have generated significant controversy. One issue relates to duration. It is difficult to make a diagnosis in which the symptoms need be present for only a few days and do not necessarily cause significant distress. Another complication relates to symptom intensity. Distinguishing normal from abnormal is not always easy when the variables include such core human behaviors as talkativeness, risk taking, need for sleep, and self-esteem. To address this controversy, DSM-5 balances two competing interests. The first is to identify robust, discrete symptom clusters that occur within distressed patients. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for a cluster of disorders that cause significant dysfunction and distress and are accompanied by a lifetime risk of suicide that is more than 20 times that in the general population. The second competing interest is to avoid pathologizing normal human experience. Absent reliable tests for \"bipolar disorder,\" the onus is on the clinician to make use of these criteria and to follow available evidence in both the diagnosis and treatment of these challenging patients.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer.

      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "Whether psychotic symptoms are part of the fundamental psychopathology of borderline personality disorder remains in dispute. The goal of the study was to examine the incidence and nature of psychotic symptoms in a sample of patients with the disorder.The inpatient psychiatric records of 92 patients with a discharge diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, some of whom had comorbid affective disorder or substance abuse disorder, were examined to obtain data on the presence of psychotic symptoms (narrowly defined as delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations), the duration of psychotic episodes, and the clinical characteristics of the patients.Twenty-seven percent of the patients had psychotic episodes, typically lasting many weeks. Comorbid affective or substance abuse disorders did not predict psychotic symptoms.Psychotic episodes are common but not universal among patients with borderline personality disorder, regardless of whether a concurrent axis I disorder is present. Those episodes are not necessarily brief or transient, and borderline patients who experience psychotic episodes are likely to have repeated hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "title": "Functional (Psychogenic) Cognitive Disorders: A Perspective from the Neurology Clinic",
      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "La evolución de una psicosis emergente de expresión variable. Estudio de un caso clínico",
      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

Psychosis can affect the mind in many ways, but usually, we talk about various forms of primary psychosis such as schizophrenia. Clinical experience has shown that the most common cause of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations in patients infected with COVID-19 (or any serious illness), is delirium. Long COVID can be worsened by psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, or dissociative symptoms), and it can also generate dissociative psychotic symptoms in people with vulnerabilities. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is associated with a massively dysfunctional brain chemistry response to medication (typically antipsychotic medication) and/or an inflammatory cascade (from illness or massive overuse of muscles).",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is the technical term for what non-psychologists call madness. In contrast to the symptoms of neurosis, psychotic symptoms are categorically outside the normal realm of experience, and as such they are beyond our common-sense powers of understanding and empathy. It is this aspect of psychotic symptoms that isolates persons experiencing them in \"a world of their own\". The availability of anti-psychotic drugs means that many sufferers today can obtain significant relief from symptoms. The experiences of persons in the grip of psychotic episodes recorded in centuries past are remarkably similar to the kinds of feelings and ideas described by sufferers. Delusions may present as part of a complex of psychotic phenomena as in schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression, or as the lone, predominant psychotic feature of a paranoid psychosis. The delusions associated with the affective psychoses tend to have contents that are congruent with the mood of the patient.",

In turn, characterological depressions are divisible into at least two subtypes: (1) \"Subaffective dysthymias\" have even sex distribution, are often complicated by superimposed depressive episodes, rapid eye movement latency is shortened, and they tend to respond to tricyclics or lithium carbonate. In brief, they share many features of primary affective illness. (2) \"Character spectrum disorders,\" by contrast, represent a heterogeneous mixture of personality disorders with inconstant depressive features, are more common in women, are often complicated by alcohol and drug abuse, and outcome tends to be unfavorable.",

      "abstract": "Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migrana (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "abstract": "Empirical results from epidemiological studies on pain-depression comorbidity in primary care and population samples have shown that: (a) pain is as strongly associated with anxiety as with depressive disorders; (b) characteristics that most strongly predict depression are diffuseness of pain and the extent to which pain interferes with activities; (c) certain psychological symptoms (low energy, disturbed sleep, worry) are prominent among pain patients, while others (guilt, loneliness) are not; (d) depression and pain dysfunction are evident early in the natural history of pain, but dysfunction and distress are often transient; and (e) among initially dysfunctional pain patients whose dysfunction is chronic, depression levels do not improve but neither do they increase over time with chronicity alone. These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

On account of the absence of a satisfactory definition and of its clinical and electroencephalographical dynamic temporal evolution, recognition of this entity is a major clinical problem. Only the early recognition of CSE allows an urgent treatment, the reason why it should be adopted the following practical definition: 5 min or more of continuous seizures or two or more seizures without regain of consciousness between them. The treatment should be immediately initiated whenever a patient has a convulsion that persists more than 5 min, has a second seizure in the posictal period, or experience a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion at the time of arrival in the emergency department. The typical temporal evolution of CSE affects its prognosis since subtil SE is more refractory to treatment than evident SE.

Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

Psychotic symptoms may appear during episodes of mood disturbance; however, it should not be the dominating feature and should not appear during periods of normal mood.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "abstract": "Refractory status epilepticus (RSE), defined as status epilepticus that fails to respond to the acute administration of two antiepileptic medications, occurs in approximately a third of patients with status epilepticus, and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, mortality, and functional disability. Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

      "title": "Case of Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia - Continuum Through Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by spontaneous and unexpected occurrence of panic attacks, the frequency of which can vary from several attacks per day to only a few attacks per year. Panic disorder is usually qualified with the presence or absence of agoraphobia. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is an anxious disorder where repeated attacks of fear and anxiety appear at places and situations out of the family surrounding, places where the escape is difficult and where someone would be helpless, as for an example crowded places, passing over bridges, traveling by public transport, walking in an open space. Depressive episodes, as well as obsessive-compulsive procedures, can also follow this condition. A female person aged 25 years presents with a classical panic disorder with an agoraphobia and a classic and secure behavior. She also suffers from dysthymia and a chronic fluctuating mood and low self-confidence. The patient gets panic attack when traveling by public transport in the morning when going to work, in a restaurant, in a supermarket, in a disco, when walking in an open space. The symptomatology started half a year before going to the psychiatrist, after several close persons died. A short description of CBT. CBT is based on the cognitive model of an emotional answer and aspects of stoic philosophy. CBT is based on an idea that our thoughts cause emotions and different behavior, so that we can change the way of thinking, and after that feelings/behavior unchanged situations. CBT uses Socrates' method and some techniques from psychodrama, as well as relaxing techniques. Giving «homework» and keeping a diary is also a very important part of this therapy. Seven therapeutic sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in a combination with the antidepressants (one session weekly) were performed. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a leading therapy in dealing with agoraphobia and panic attacks. In combination with SSRI, it gives excellent results in reduction of the symptomatology. At the end of the treatment, the mental state was significantly improved. The patient came in contact with her beliefs and the basic models developed in childhood, and learned how to cope with negative thoughts, feelings and maladaptive behavior.",

Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "Les états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels sont classiquement séparés en deux formes, l’état d’absence (EA) et l’état de mal partiel complexe (EMPC). Le diagnostic est difficile sur la base des seuls éléments cliniques et nécessite un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) d’urgence. L’EA ou « petit mal status » est la forme la plus fréquente d’états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels. Il est caractérisé par une confusion fluctuante, d’intensité variable, souvent associée à des myoclonies périoculaires. L’EEG montre des décharges critiques généralisées qui cèdent sous benzodiazépines alors que la conscience se normalise. Les EA possèdent une importante hétérogénéité nosographique. Quatre groupes peuvent être individualisés : EA typiques s’inscrivant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée idiopathique, EA atypiques survenant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée symptomatique ou cryptogénique, EA « de novo » de l’adulte caractérisés par des facteurs de provocation toxiques ou métaboliques, EA avec éléments focaux s’observant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie partielle préexistante. Les EMPC temporaux sont caractérisés par des décharges temporales continues ou récurrentes et peuvent être organisés de façon cyclique, cette présentation étant caractéristique mais rare. Ils nécessitent un traitement énergique en raison de leur résistance et du risque de séquelles cognitives. Les EMPC frontaux constituent un défi diagnostique. Ils sont en effet souvent inauguraux, de présentation clinique déroutante et symptomatiques d’une lésion focale dans un cas sur trois. Nonconvulsive confusional status epilepticus is classically divided on the basis of the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) into absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. AS is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Confusion of varying intensity is associated in half of the cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. “De novo” AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures, which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness characterizes CPSE of temporal lobe origin that requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, symptoms are unusual and patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one third of cases.",

On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

Epilepsy is not only a brain pathology characterized by a lasting predisposition to generate seizures, it is also associated with cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and social disorders. The interaction between psychiatric pathologies and epilepsy is bidirectional and complex. This association is summarized in the neologism Epi-Psy. Psychiatric pathologies affect at least one third of epileptic patients and up to 80% in cases of drug-resistant epilepsy. The diagnostic approach should distinguish between peri-ictal disorders (chronologically linked to the seizure: pre-ictal, ictal, or post-ictal) and inter-ictal disorders (not chronologically linked to the seizures: iatrogenic, specific to epilepsy or non-specific). The main psychiatric disorders related to epilepsy are psychosis, depression, anxiety and substance use. The impact on quality of life is significant. The therapeutic strategy is both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic. The prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is possible and desirable for anxiety or depressive disorders, with no contraindication for epilepsy.

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of all the major mental illnesses with one year prevalence in European countries of around 5%, and with a range from 3.1% to 10.1%. Depressive Episodes are associated with disability and frequently have a long duration: in one third of patients the episode will last for more than 2 years, the criteria for chronic depression. Recurrence is predicted by a number of factors including severity of depression, number of prior episodes, time since previous episode and absence of remission or presence of subsyndromal symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes and the severity of the current episode: once a patient has suffered from three episodes of depression, he has more than 95% chance of having another. Although effective pharmacotherapeutic agents are available, depressed patients are often undertreated or treated for an inadequate period of time. Initial acute treatment of Major Depression results in a significant lessening of depressive symptoms (response) progressing to absence of depressive symptoms (remission) which means the return to the patient’s premorbid state. Stable remission for 46 months is thought of as a recovery. A worsening of symptoms or the return of a major depression is considered a relapse before recovery has been achieved and recurrence if it occurs later. The distinction between remission vs. recovery and relapse vs. recurrence is not possible. The three phases of treatment are: acute therapy; continuation therapy; maintenance therapy. The acute phase of therapy covers the time period from the beginning of treatment to remission, which is the primary therapeutic goal. The continuation phase follows the acute phase to preserve and stabilize the remission. It is the phase in which the treatment is extended for a period of time in order to prevent a return of depression. Long-term maintenance treatment is aimed at the prevention of a new episode of depression. Long-term tolerability is, therefore, important in facilitating adherence to treatment and thereby control over depressive symptoms. The new Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inihibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inihibitors (SNRIs) are generally better tolerated than older treatments, such as Tricyclic antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. Venlafaxine XR, with its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, has been shown to be superior in efficacy to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for severe Majors Depressive Disorder. Clinical studies suggests that it has a rapid onset of action, producing significant clinical improvement in the first or second week of treatment, and long-term efficacy and may have consistently superior remission rates compared with the SSRIs. Moreover Venlafaxine XR (extended release) was effective in 92% of depressed patients in preventing recurrence in the second year of maintenance therapy (Prevent Study).",

There are simple depression and complicated depression with additional psychopathological symptoms. The most difficult is to diagnose depression with onset in early childhood, including infant's age, when the psychopathological presentations depend on the consequences of the perinatal CNS lesion, maternal deprivation and other factors. In children, the clinical picture of depression differs by syndromologic incompleteness, peculiarity of phenomenological presentations and polymorphism of disorders. In adolescence, depression is characterized by the predominance of behavioral disorders, marked psychopathic-like disorders, suicidal attempts, higher frequency of bipolar forms. Depression with late age at onset differs by the abundance of somatic and hypochondriac complaints, anxiety and depressive delusion accompanied by the transitory aggravation of cognitive impairment (depressive pseudodementia).",

      "title": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: how to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat it.",
      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno psiquiátrico que presenta según el DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)(1), síntomas característicos como ideas delirantes, alucinaciones, lenguaje desorganizado (por ejemplo, descarrilamiento frecuente o incoherencia), comportamiento catatónico o gravemente desorganizado, síntomas negativos, (por ejemplo, aplanamiento afectivo, alogia o abulia), que afecta principalmente a personas en edad productiva, con alto impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente y en su entorno familiar y social. En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

      "abstract": "Despite much education and research, bipolar disorder is still under-recognized and inappropriately treated in many clinical settings. (1) Bipolar and unipolar depression display similar symptoms, making correct diagnosis difficult. The differential diagnosis is especially problematic in patients suffering a first major depressive episode, when there is no clear history of mania or hypomania. Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants. The patient complains of feeling antsy or being agitated or unable to sleep when taking traditional antidepressants. Look for numerous failed antidepressant trials, apparent tolerance to antidepressants that does not resolve with increased dose, and antidepressant-induced mania or mood cycle acceleration. Hypomania, hyperthymic temperament, or mood swings in a patient's history. Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence. Ask about periods of elevated mood or energy that might not fit formal DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomania--such as episodes that last only a day or two. Mood lability in younger patients can be especially dramatic and poorly demarcated. Irritable, hostile, or mixed features. Some patients show one or more hypomanic features, such as racing thoughts when depressed. Psychomotor retardation appears more common in bipolar I depression than in unipolar major depression. Psychomotor agitation, however, is more likely in bipolar II than in unipolar major depression. Loaded family history of mood swings, frank bipolar disorder, or affective illness. A family history of comorbid mood disorder and alcoholism may also point to bipolarity. Abrupt onset and/or termination of depressive bouts or relatively brief episodes ( Seasonal or postpartum depression. Winter-type seasonal affective disorder--feeling depressed in the fall and winter, hypomanic in the spring--and postpartum psychosis have clinical and epidemiologic links with bipolar disorder.

      "abstract": "espanolEn la actualidad, la alucinosis y la celotipia, antes consideradas entidades propias, se recogen en las clasificaciones diagnosticas mas reconocidas dentro de la categoria de trastornos psicoticos inducidos por el alcohol (con predominio de alucinaciones o de delirios). La alucinosis es una forma infrecuente de psicosis organica subaguda que sigue al alcoholismo cronico. Consiste en alucinaciones auditivas con un nivel de conciencia normal, y generalmente tiene buen pronostico con el tratamiento adecuado. Es primordial diferenciarlo del delirium tremens y otros cuadros psicoticos mas graves. En la celotipia el sujeto sufre delirio de celos, siendo fundamental determinar el riesgo de agresividad hacia la pareja y poder actuar consecuentemente. Los diferentes estudios de comorbilidad realizados senalan la alta probabilidad de que un alcoholico padezca a lo largo de su vida algun tipo de trastorno mental. Se revisan aqui las distintas posibilidades de relacion entre los trastornos comorbidos y el trastorno por uso del alcohol, la prevalencia de las distintas patologias coexistentes posibles, asi como la importancia, impacto y consecuencias de la patologia dual en estos pacientes. EnglishNowadays, alcoholic hallucinosis and jealousy delusion, not so long ago considered as independent entities, are now dealt with, in the majority of the most acknowledged diagnostic classifications, in the category of alcohol missuse induced psychotic disorders (with a prevailing presence of hallucinations or delusion). On the one hand, hallucinosis is an infrequent type of subacute organic psychosis following chronic or ingrained alcoholism, consisting of auditory hallucinations while in normal levels of consciousness. It generally has a good prognosis with the appropiate treatment. It is absolutely essential to distinguish and differenciate this disorder from delirium tremens and others with a more serious prognosis, and also another psychotic episodes. On the other hand, in jealousy delusion the patient experiences or suffers from episodes of pathological and irrational jealousy – being fundamental to establish potential risks of physical agressive behaviour towards his or her couple in order to be able to cope and act in accordance -. Surveys on the issue of comorbidity show that there is a high degree of probability for an alcoholic to suffer from some type of mental disorder in lifetime. Finally, this paper aims to review the different possibilities of interrelation between comorbid disorders and alcohol dependence; the prevailing importance of the different coexisting pathologies that may be possible; and also the importance, impact and consequences of the dual pathology in these patients.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms.

The term depressive disorder is reserved to describe a person who has had multiple depressive episodes, periods of time of 2 weeks or longer when they feel depressed, cannot enjoy life, and have problems with eating and sleeping, guilt feelings, loss of energy, trouble concentrating, and thoughts about death. Most depressive disorders are recurrent and lifelong.",

This syndrome is caused by numerous primary and secondary etiologies. The most common primary cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which reaches almost 50% of dementia cases. The DA it consists of biological fragments of the amyloid precursor protein that are deposited in the brain 10 years or more, before the first symptoms appear. The period before the onset of symptoms is called the preclinical stage. The transition between the silence of symptoms and their appearance, usually due to memory loss for recent events, is known as the prodromal phase. Continuing the pathophysiological process, the stage of mild dementia takes place, when the patient has one more cognitive component associated with memory loss; follows the moderate, severe, profound and terminal phase of dementia.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– A classification of schizoaffective disorders for research purposes is presented. Two main categories are preliminarily singled out: 1) that characterized by the consecutive appearance of an affective and a schizophrenic syndrome (type I), 2) that marked by the concurrent appearance of a full schizophrenic and a full affective syndrome (type II). Within type I, two subtypes are distinguished: 1) that beginning as a typical schizophrenic disorder and shifting later on into a recurrent affective syndrome (affective subtype), 2) that beginning as an affective disorder and showing in its further course a progressive schizophrenic development towards deterioration (schizophrenic subtype). For type II, a multiaxial classification is proposed. Axis 1 should be used to describe the cross‐sectional symptomatology, axis 2 to define the course, and axis 3 to note the presence of associated factors. On axis 1, schizoaffective disorder type II can be divided into a manic and a depressive subtype. Operational diagnostic criteria for each are provided. On axis 2, an affective (recurrent) and a schizophrenic (continuous with exacerbations) subtype can be distinguished.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "title": "Psychosis in epilepsy patients",
      "abstract": "Summary Epileptic psychoses reflect a fundamental disruption in the fidelity of mind and occur during seizure freedom or during or after seizures. The psychotic symptoms in epilepsy share some qualities with schizophrenic psychosis, such as positive symptoms of paranoid delusions and hallucinations. Psychotic syndromes in epilepsy are most common but not exclusively associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. De Novo psychosis following epilepsy surgery is rare. Forced normalization—psychosis associated with dramatic reduction of epileptiform activity or seizures is described in small series only. Ictal and postictal psychosis can be prevented with seizure control, but postictal and chronic interictal psychoses require multidisciplinary and psychopharmacologic management.",

      "abstract": "Children who have epilepsy (two or more unprovoked seizures) are at risk of experiencing cognitive and behavioral consequences related to: 1) the underlying brain dysfunction that resulted in the seizures, 2) the side effects of anticonvulsant drugs, and 3) psychosocial problems in the family, including the vulnerable child syndrome. Although certain epilepsy syndromes, such as infantile spasms, are associated with mental retardation or progressive intellectual decline, others typically are associated with normal development. Children who have \"absence\" attacks, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and benign Rolandic seizures, for example, generally are not impaired cognitively. When children are intellectually normal prior to the onset of epilepsy, intellectual decline is rare regardless of the number of seizures.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devastating brain disease that affects ∼1% of the population worldwide and is characterized by a complex array of positive (delusions and hallucinations), negative (apathy and social withdrawal), and cognitive (deficits in attention and working memory) symptoms. Clinical features of schizophrenia frequently arise during late adolescence or early adulthood, which places this disease as the most chronic of the psychotic disorders and as one of the leading causes of disability and premature mortality (1). Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is at the core of schizophrenia and precedes the manifestation of psychosis (2). Furthermore, no pharmacological treatment is currently available for cognitive deficits, which are among the most debilitating symptoms of the disorder. The identification of novel treatments to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia thus seems crucial to improve the quality of life in these patients.",

Acute symptomatic seizures (ASS) are the seizures of different etiology that occur in close temporary relationship to acute damage of the central nervous system arising simultaneously due to metabolic, toxic, infectious and inflammatory factors and structural brain damage.

Tactics in the ASS and symptomatic epileptic status of any nature provides for the immediate carrying out differential diagnosis and differential treatment. Treatment of ASS includes two aspects: reduction in ictal activity (seizures) and prevention of future development of seizures through the elimination or correction of physiological trigger of the attacks and the decision to conduct a long-term antiepileptic drug therapy if the risk of seizures is saved.",

      "abstract": "The DSM-IV criteria for mania require: a distinct period that represents a break from pre-morbid functioning, a duration of at least one week, elevated or irritable mood, at least three to four classical manic signs and symptoms and the absence of any physical factors. Although not specifically mentioned in the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV definitions, delusional, hallucinatory, even first-rank, psychotic experiences can occur in mania. Acute mania can be subdivided into classical pure mania, mania with mood-congruent or mood-incongruent psychosis, mixed state and rapid-cycling mania. One quarter to two thirds of all manic episodes are associated with delusions, while 13% to 40% are associated with hallucinations. Mixed episode is a complex syndrome which is difficult to diagnose, has the most prolonged duration of bipolar episodes and more frequent psychotic profile than pure mania with high suicidality and poor response to drugs. Mixed state mania has been well known since Kreapelin and listed in classification systems with criteria that include both a manic and a major depressive episode nearly every day for at least a one-week period. On the other hand, mixed-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electro-convulsive therapy or light therapy) should not contribute toward a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder. Although, theoretically, mania is supposed to be resolved within 1-3 months even without treatment, psychiatric hospitalization is very common in especially severe cases due to functional impairment. Current treatments for mania aim to control the agitation, impulsivity, aggression and psychotic symptoms and to help patients regain their pre-morbid functionality. However, the clinical management of mania is challenging as most patients show syndromal remission but incomplete functional recovery after the first episode of mania.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The inference is reached that the depressive syndrome is by no means alien to the schizophrenic psychosis on the ground of detailed clinical follow-up study of 153 psychotic seizures in 71 patients, affected with various forms of schizophrenia. The depressive syndrome occurs in the clinical picture of most of the patients in the course of the disease, and, more particularly in those suffering from periodic form, in which, not infrequently, alternation of maniacal and depressive manifestations is observed. Dysthymia is the initial symptom of the disease very often. It usually occurs as a response type (similar to hypochondriac or depressive â€žreaction`) with production of insanity and other symptoms ensuing. The depressive syndrome is scarcely manifested in its pure form. Most frequently, depressive paranoid syndrome and depressive hypochondriac syndrome are observed with the insanity production being concomitant to hallucinations and eventually, pseudo-hallucinations and other symptoms of the psychic automatism. The schizophrenic dysthymia and the melanocholic insanity of schizophreniacs might display complete simulation of cyclothymia. However, the insanity in schizofpherenia very often assumes a rather generalized, greatly ridiculous and absurd character. Although dysthymia appears to be the initial symptom of the affection rather frequently, the melancholic insanity is usually manifested much later. Neuroletipcs play a supplementary role in terms of increasing the incidence of cases with depressive pictures and intensification of their manifestations. The higher incidence of depressive syndromes in schizophrenia, recently observed, should be accounted for, frist and foremost by the â€žmilder`, more â€žpsychological` and less â€žbiological` manifestation of the disease.",

Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

This chapter therefore refers to the disorder by its older, but more accurate, name. Although the diagnosis of manic depressive disorder is made on the basis of phenomenology, there are several reasons to conduct a thorough medical history and physical examination. First, there are general medical or substance-related causes of mania and depression that, if treated, may lead to the resolution of the mood episode. Second, medical evaluation is necessary before starting several types of medications used in the treatment of manic depressive disorder. Manic depressive disorder has its onset in most persons in adolescence and young adulthood, between the ages of 15 and 30. Type II bipolar disorder is characterized by having the patient experience a hypomanic episode and episodes of major depression, but no full manic episodes.",

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta. En este articulo se pretende revisar las posibles evolu- ciones y sus opciones terapeuticas, abordar si existe riesgo de encarnizamiento terapeutico, y finalizar con algunas cuestiones de la vida de estos pacientes que influyen en el afronta- miento de la enfermedad EnglishDepression is the most frequent psychia- tric illness in elderly patients. It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "title": "Efecto de la suplementación con probióticos en la epilepsia farmacorresistente",
      "abstract": "La epilepsia es una enfermedad cerebral definida por una de las siguientes condiciones: - al menos 2 crisis no provocadas que ocurran con una separacion de al menos 24 horas - una crisis no provocada con la probabilidad de tener mas crisis en los proximos 10 anos similar al riesgo general de recurrencia (al menos 60%) de dos crisis epilepticas no provocadas, - diagnostico de sindrome epileptico (grupo de entidades que se identifican con seguridad por un conjunto de caracteristicas electroclinicas).\nEn Espana segun el estudio EPIBERIA se calcula que la epilepsia tiene una prevalencia de un 0,6%, lo que supone que en nuestro pais hay cerca de 280.000 pacientes que padecen esta enfermedad. Actualmente se han disenado farmacos antiepilepticos con los que se consigue un control de crisis en la mayoria de los casos. Pero queda un 25-30% restante en el que el tratamiento no es efectivo y el paciente sigue presentando crisis, lo que se denomina: epilepsia farmacorresistente. Para este tipo de epilepsia tambien hay tratamientos: el uso combinado de farmacos, la cirugia, la colocacion de estimuladores o la utilizacion de la dieta cetogenica. A pesar de estos ultimos tratamientos comentados (los cuales no estan indicado para todos los pacientes), seguimos teniendo un grupo de pacientes que sigue presentando crisis, con la perdida de calidad de vida y aumento de mortalidad que esto conlleva.\nEs en la busqueda, por mejorar el control de las crisis y la calidad de vida de estos pacientes, donde surge la hipotesis de este trabajo: el uso de probioticos en la epilepsia farmacorresistente.\nEsta idea surgio, en base a estudios actuales, que ponen en relacion la interaccion entre la microbiota y el sistema nervioso central, lo que se denomina como: eje microbiota-intestino-cerebro o en ingles brain En los ultimos anos cada vez hay mas articulos que relacionan ambos organos y que se han propuesto como etiopatogenia de diferentes enfermedades neurologicas como pueden ser el Parkinson, el Alzheimer, la migrana, la Esclerosis Multiple, e incluso ya hay un estudio de hace unos meses que lo relaciona con epilepsia. \nNuestra hipotesis fue, que modificando la microbiota, gracias a la administracion de probioticos, podriamos mejorar el manejo de las crisis en pacientes epilepticos farmacorresistentes. Esta hipotesis la basamos en 4 supuestos: 1.- La generacion de neurotransmisores inhibidores por parte de la microbiota intestinal, como puede ser el GABA, que favorecen la inhibicion de crisis.\n2.- El poder antiinflamatorio de los probioticos, que estaria actuando sobre uno de los mecanismos etiopatogenicos de la epilepsia, la inflamacion.\n3.- La posible modificacion de la microbiota y su posible implicacion en la epilepsia 4.- La accion de la microbiota sobre el metabolismo de los farmacos. \nEl estudio fue aprobado por el comite de etica de nuestro Hospital. \nSe realizo un estudio cuasi-experimental donde cada paciente fue su propio control (para evitar el sesgo de la diferencia del numero de crisis; pero con la limitacion de que no tiene comparador contra placebo).\nEn el estudio participaron 45 pacientes que acudieron un total de 4 veces. La visita inicial fue para proponer el estudio, validar criterios de inclusion y exclusion y firma del consentimiento informado; ese dia se inicio un registro de recogida basal de crisis de 3 meses. La visita 2 es el momento de inicio de los probioticos que tomaron durante 4 meses. En la visita 3 se comprueba la efectividad de los probioticos (con el control de reduccion de crisis gracias al registro de las mismas) y se realiza una visita mas, 4 meses despues para comprobar si la efectividad persiste a pesar de la suspension del tratamiento. En cada visita se realizo una toma de constantes, peso y analitica de sangre, orina y heces y un registro de control de crisis, adhesion al tratamiento y calidad de vida.\nLos resultados de nuestro estudio son positivos, de tal manera que hemos encontrado una reduccion de crisis de mas del 50% (reduccion minima establecida para poder considerarse efectiva en los ensayos clinicos sobre epilepsia) en el 28,9% de los pacientes.\nSe ha obtenido una mejora en la calidad de vida (clinica y estadisticamente significativa) y una comprobacion de la seguridad de los probioticos en nuestro estudio.\nRESUMEN BIBLIOGRAFIA:\n1.- Serrano-Castro PJ, Mauri-Llerda JA, Hernandez-Ramos Fj, Sanchez Alvzrez JC et al.

Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

Pacientes com epilepsia parcial têm um risco maior do que aqueles com epilepsia generalizada idiopática. Além disso, a condição crônica das crises parece ser um fator importante no risco aumentado. Os sintomas resultam de mecanismos psicopatológicos muito diversos entre os pacientes. As classificações são baseadas na sintomatologia psiquiátrica, na presença ou ausência de distúrbios da consciência, em anormalidades do EEG e na relação temporal entre os sintomas e as crises. RESULTADOS: Comorbidades psiquiátricas em epilepsia são muito freqüentes, especialmente aquelas que têm o lobo temporal como área epileptogênica principal. As desordens com maior prevalência são os distúrbios de humor como depressão maior, ansiedade e psicose. CONCLUSÃO: A epilepsia do lobo temporal per se, não pode ser considerada um fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de sintomas psiquiátricos, ou mais severos, dentre os pacientes com epilepsia parcial. Fatores concomitantes como duração da epilepsia e freqüência de crises podem ter um papel adicional importante. O reconhecimento mais acurado das comorbidades psiquiátricas poderá ajudar no desenvolvimento e implementação de programas apropriados de diagnóstico e tratamento, assim como melhorar o devir e a qualidade de vida dos pacientes com epilepsia.",

Pada skizofrenia, terjadi pecahnya atau ketidakserasian antara afeksi, kognitif, dan perilaku. Wanita 46 tahun datang dengan keluhan mengamuk tanpa alasan yang jelas. Sekitar 1 bulan sebelum masuk rumah sakit jiwa, pasien sering terlihat bicara sendiri dan tertawa sendiri. Selain itu, pasien susah untuk diajak berkomunikasi dan pembicaraannya sulit dimengerti. Pada pemeriksaan status psikiatrikus didapatkan sikap kurang kooperatif, mood irritable , halusinasi auditorik, halusinasi visual, flight of ideas , waham kebesaran, waham curiga, penilaian realita terganggu, dan tilikan derajat satu. Diagnosis multiaksial, yaitu aksis I: skizofrenia paranoid, aksis II dan III: belum dapat ditegakkan diagnosisnya, aksis IV: masalah ekonomi, ketidakpahaman pasien dengan kondisi penyakit, aksis V: GAF: 40-31. Terapi psikofarmaka adalah antipsikotik atipikal yaitu Risperidone dengan dosis 2x2 mg dan olanzapine 2x5 mg selama 5 hari, kemudian dilakukan observasi kembali serta psikoterapi suportif.

These patients experience trembling, muscle aches, insomnia, bowel movement upsets, dizziness, and irritability. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with extreme anxiety about being judged by others or having extreme anxiety about behaving in a way that might cause embarrassment or ridicule. Anxiety disorders are treated as follows: psychosocial therapies; medications; and both psychosocial therapies and medications. The three main types of depressive disorders can occur with any of the major anxiety disorders: major depression; dysthymia/chronic depression; and bipolar disorder.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is considered one of the leading psychiatric disorders due to its\r\n incidence of 1% in the general population. Due to its many presentations it can not be defined as\r\n a single entity, but rather a disorder with heterogeneous genetic, neurobiological, environmental\r\n and social background, manifested by a series of cognitive, behavioral and emotional deviations,\r\n which speaks in favor that there are no two identical clinical presentations of schizophrenia.\r\n Schizophrenia is also a chronic disorder, requiring long-term care. Because of its long duration,\r\n insufficiently known etiology, behavioral changes and alterations of psychic functions, and the\r\n fact that it most commonly occurs during late adolescence, schizophrenia significantly impairs\r\n work and social functionality of the affected individual and has a negative impact on both the\r\n quality of life of the patient and the patient’s family, health system and society in general.\r\n What has recently caught the field’s attention is the presence of comorbid somatic\r\n diseases in patients with schizophrenia who have not yet been adequately diagnosed and treated.\r\n One of the most common and severely debilitating is the metabolic syndrome. It is a syndrome\r\n consisting of a series of metabolic abnormalities that result from a number of factors, such as:\r\n inadequate nutrition, lack of physical activity and smoking, the effects of the psychotic disorder\r\n itself, as well as the potentially adverse effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.\r\n The term metabolic syndrome implies abdominal or central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with\r\n lowered HDL-cholesterol, hypertension and hyperglycemia. If these metabolic disorders occur at\r\n the same time, the patient is at increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and the\r\n development of type II diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, along with suicide, is the most important\r\n cause of mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Metabolic abnormalities are known to be\r\n associated with chronic course of the disorder and long-term administration of certain\r\n antipsychotics. However, there is a possibility that metabolic parameters are impaired at the\r\n outset of the disorder, that is, when the first diagnosis of schizophrenia is made. That is in fact the\r\n main hypothesis of this research. The aim of the study was to prospectively examine and analyze the values of the\r\n aforementioned metabolic parameters and to determine if the metabolic syndrome is present in\r\n 30 subjects with the first episode of schizophrenia. Those values were compared with those of\r\n other 30 subjects, who were previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and another 30 subjects,\r\n who were not diagnosed with the disorder (healthy individuals). This study was conducted at the\r\n Clinic for Psychiatry of the UHC Sestre milosrdnice. For the purpose of the study, laboratory\r\n values of serum lipids and glucose, anthropometric measures, and the existence of nicotine\r\n dependence in the subjects were analyzed.\r\n The study did not confirm the hypothesis that metabolic parameters are abnormal at\r\n the very beginning of the disorder, when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made for the first time\r\n in patients’ lives. The present parameters do not meet the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of\r\n metabolic disorder in patients with the first episode of schizophrenia.",

Die Prognose ist in den meisten Fällen gut, zur Akuttherapie werden Neuroleptika eingesetzt. Selten sind paranoide Störungen, speziell der alkoholische Eifersuchtswahn, der manchmal als Residuum einer chronischen Alkoholhalluzinose persistiert und monosymptomatisch bleibt.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse.

A severe, chronic brain disorder, schizophrenia is characterized by an onset in early adulthood, a lifelong course, debilitating symptoms, deterioration in functional ability, and lack of social acceptability, making it among the most disabling, and economically catastrophic disorders.2 Symptoms appear in men in their late teens or early 20s, whereas women are generally affected in their 20s or early 30s.3 In the U.S., annual direct and indirect costs of the disorder total more than $62 billion.4\r\n\r\nFour symptom clusters have been observed in large groups of patients.5 Positive symptoms (psychosis) are correlated with hospital admission and a first-time diagnosis. Delusions are the most common psychotic symptom and occur in 65% of patients with schizophrenia.6,7 Hallucinations and disorganized thinking occur in approximately 50% of these patients. Auditory hallucinations are the most common sensory disturbance, but visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations may occur.8 Most patients experience a combination of delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorganization.6\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms represent a loss of affective responsiveness, verbal expression, personal motivation, enjoyment, social drive, or attention to the environment.9 All cognitive domains are also affected by the disorder, including attention, language, memory, and executive function.10 The combination of blunted, inappropriate, and odd expressions is the most common affective disturbance in schizophrenia.11 Depressive symptoms are the most common mood disturbance in schizophrenia.12\r\n\r\nIn 2002, direct annual health care costs were estimated at $22.7 billion for the U.S., $7.6 billion in other direct costs, and $32.4 billion in lost economic productivity and caregiver costs, for a total of $62.7 billion.4 Schizophrenia accounts for 2.5% of all health care expenditures, 25% of hospital beds, and 20% of all Social Security benefit days. 13 Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia, with alterations in neurotransmitter pathways (e.g., with dopamine) and enlarged sulci and ventricles found on brain imaging.14",

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder. The latter (by DSM-III-R criteria) requires a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for 2 weeks or longer, and the simultaneous presence of a constellation of",

Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.Este trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).Se discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.El presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

Caso clínico: Paciente de 31 años sin antecedentes conocidos que debuta con un primer episodio psicótico, no enfermedades conocidas de interés. Consumo diario de cannabis sin especificar cuánto pero en incremento en los meses previos. Niega consumo de otras sustancias, no tiene ningún tratamiento pautado. Nula conciencia de enfermedad de la clínica psicótica ni del trastorno relacionado con el consumo, solicitando durante el ingreso que se le recete cannabis porque es la única medicina que le ayuda. Durante los dos años previos al ingreso se produce una situación de aislamiento progresivo, rompiendo los vínculos sociales y familiares, llegando a dejar de hablar incluso con los convivientes. Durante el ingreso en la unidad de hospitalización breve se realiza coordinación con profesionales de la unidad de conductas adictivas y del centro de rehabilitación psicosocial para un abordaje integral del caso. Conclusiones: En múltiples estudios se ha descrito la asociación entre la aparición de psicosis y el consumo de cannabis, describiéndose como factores que influyen en esta asociación la edad de inicio del consumo y la frecuencia. Así mismo, tanto la psicosis como el consumo de cannabis pueden influir de forma negativa sobre el funcionamiento psicosocial y laboral.

      "title": "Impulsivität und Arbeitsgedächtnis bei Patienten mit bipolarer affektiver Störung in unterschiedlichen Krankheitsepisoden",
      "abstract": "Die bipolare Storung ist eine schwere und weit verbreitete psychiatrische Erkrankung, die durch wiederkehrende Manien und Depressionen gekennzeichnet ist. Eine Manie zeichnet sich unter anderem durch eine situationsinadaquat aufgehellte Stimmung, Hyperaktivitat und Verlust sozialer Hemmungen aus, wahrend die Depression durch gedruckte Stimmung, Interessenverlust, Freudlosigkeit, Antriebsverminderung und Konzentrationsstorungen gekennzeichnet ist. Zwischen diesen Episoden durchlaufen Patienten Phasen mit Stimmungsnormalisierung („Euthymie“), oft ohne schwere kognitive Defizite oder andere residuelle Symptome. Bisherige Studien uber zugrunde liegende neuronale Mechanismen haben ein Konsens-Modell zur Krankheitsentstehung hervorgebracht, welches von einer Storung in der Fruhentwicklung von an der Emotionsregulation beteiligten Strukturen ausgeht, was in eine verminderte Konnektivitat zwischen prafrontalen Strukturen und Strukturen des limbischen Systems mundet. Dies wiederum fuhrt zu einer gestorten prafrontalen Regulation limbischer Gehirnareale und somit zu einem Verlust der emotionalen Homoostase, was die Patienten der Gefahr aussetzt, extreme Stimmungszustande zu entwickeln und zwischen diesen zu wechseln. Auch weil Zusammenhange zwischen genetischen Veranderungen und funktioneller Neuroanatomie noch unklar bleiben, fokussiert sich ein Teil der Forschung auf verschiedene exekutive und kognitive Gehirnfunktionen, deren Einschrankung entscheidend zum heterogenen Erscheinungsbild der Erkrankung beitragen kann. Ein Beispiel einer exekutiven Funktion stellt der multidimensionale Personlichkeitsfaktor Impulsivitat mit seiner Operationalisierung Antworthemmung dar. Dem gegenuber kann beispielsweise das Arbeitsgedachtnis als zentrale kognitive Funktion herangezogen werden. Dabei steht die Frage im Zentrum, ob Defizite solcher Funktionen eher phasenabhangig (engl. „state“) oder vielmehr als uberdauernder Wesenszug (engl. „trait“) der Erkrankung vorhanden sind. \r\nDas Ziel dieser Studie war, Unterschiede in Antworthemmung und Arbeitsgedachtnis zwischen akut kranken Patienten, gesunden Kontrollen und denselben Patienten im remittierten Zustand zu erfassen. Um die Antworthemmung zu untersuchen, wurde ein kombiniertes Go-/NoGo- und Stopp-Signal-Paradigma angewandt und Unterschiede in den abhangigen Variablen Reaktionszeit, Stopp-Signal-Reaktionszeit (SSRT), Auslassungsfehler und Aktionsfehler ausgewertet. Fur das Arbeitsgedachtnis wurde eine verbale N-Back-Aufgabe mit den Schwierigkeitsstufen 1-, 2- und 3-Back angewandt und ebenfalls Unterschiede in den abhangigen Variablen Reaktionszeit, Auslassungsfehler und Aktionsfehler ausgewertet. Wahrend beider Paradigmen wurde die Frontalhirnaktivitat mittels funktioneller Nahinfrarotspektroskopie untersucht und verglichen. Es wurden 36 bipolare Patienten in Depression wahrend eines stationaren Aufenthaltes auf unserer Schwerpunktstation fur bipolare Storungen rekrutiert und gemessen, von denen 15 Patienten fur eine Wiederholungsmessung in Remission rekrutiert werden konnten. Die Kontrollgruppe umfasste 30 Probanden. \r\nBeim Blick auf die Ergebnisse zeigten die Patienten in der akuten depressiven Krankheitsepisode signifikant schwachere Leistungen in Form von langsameren Reaktionszeiten und hoheren Fehlerquoten in den Aufgaben sowohl zur Antworthemmung als auch zum Arbeitsgedachtnis. In Remission hingegen zeigten sich unterschiedliche Ergebnisse. Wahrend in der Antworthemmung kein Unterschied zu den Kontrollen mehr messbar war, zeigten die Patienten in der N-Back-Aufgabe zwar eine verbesserte Leistung als in Depression im Hinblick auf Auslassungsfehler, verglichen mit den Kontrollen dennoch signifikant langsamere Reaktionszeiten. Die Auswertung der Bildgebungsdaten brachte folgende Ergebnisse hervor: In der Untersuchung der Patienten in Depression konnten in der Antworthemmung keine und im Arbeitsgedachtnis nur geringe Unterschiede festgestellt werden. Dagegen wiesen die Patienten in Remission deutliche Defizite in der prafrontalen Gehirnaktivierung auf.\r\nWerden alle Ergebnisse im Gesamtzusammenhang und auch vor dem Hintergrund vorhandener Studien interpretiert, ergibt sich folgendes Bild: Defizite in der Antworthemmung als exekutive Funktion und als ein objektiv gemessenes Mas der Impulsivitat stellen eher ein State-Merkmal sowohl der bipolaren Manie als auch der bipolaren Depression dar und erreichen in Remission wieder den Normalzustand. Umgekehrt konnen Defizite im Arbeitsgedachtnis als kognitive Funktion bei zwar verbesserter Fehlerrate, jedoch weiterhin erhohter Reaktionszeit in Remission eher als Trait-Merkmal angesehen werden. Dabei ist es moglich, dass kognitive Funktionen negativ durch einen langeren, insgesamt schwereren Krankheitsverlauf beeintrachtigt werden. Fur die Bildgebungsdaten kann keine eindeutige Interpretation formuliert werden, dennoch geben insbesondere die Ergebnisse der Patienten in Remission Hinweise darauf, dass eine verringerte prafrontale Aktivierung ein Trait-Merkmal der Erkrankung darstellen konnte.",

One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is sensory perception disorder, namely hallucinations which are typical of mental disorders in individuals characterized by changes in sensory perception, by feeling false sensations in the form of sounds (hearing), sight, taste, touch, or smell. Mental disorders are syndromes or patterns of behavior that are clinically significant that are associated with distress or suffering and pose obstacles to one or more functions of human life. One that includes mental disorders is schizophrenia. Hallucinations are false perceptual distortions that occur in maladaptive neurobiological responses, sufferers actually experience sensory distortions as real things and respond accordingly. Factors that can influence the recurrence of schizophrenic patients with hallucinations include high family emotional expressions, lack of family knowledge, availability of health services, family income and medication adherence in schizophrenic patients. psychiatric nursing care to Tn.

The disease incidence rate was estimated at 3.1% that was 3 times higher than that in general population. Slow-progredient (latent) schizophrenia with comorbid functional visceral disorders (\"organoneurotic\" schizophrenia) occurs most frequently. Once manifested, the latter was associated with somatoform disorders during the disease course and developed concomitantly with neurotic and overvalued hypochondria symptoms. The authors suggest that several variants of complex relations between the endogeneous disease (schizophrenia) severity and functional somatic disorders. Slow-progredient (latent) disease reveals an affinity to a number of somatic disorders associated with neurotic and overvalued hypochondria. In more severe disease forms combination of endogenous process with somatoform disorders is accompanied by development of hypochondria with stable algias. In progressive (paranoid) schizophrenia, association with somatoform disorders occurs only at the initial stage of the process. Somatic sensations trigger formation of delusion symptom complexes of cathestesic delusion type.",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Delirium oppstår oftest etter kirurgi og under intensivbehandling, og er en akutt forvirringstilstand på grunn av forstyrrelser i hjernens funksjoner. Patofysiologien er uklar, men delirium har en identifiserbar organisk årsak. Forløpet er fluktuerende og kan utvikle seg over tid. Symptomene kan være desorientering, hukommelsessvikt, hallusinasjoner og persepsjonsforstyrrelser (1). Pasientene blir svært sårbare fordi de har redusert evne til å ta del i, påvirke, eller kontrollere egen situasjon (2). Intensivmiljøet inneholder fysiske, psykiske og miljømessige faktorer som kan utløse et delirium, for eksempel respiratorbehandling, sedasjon, alvorlighetsgrad av kritisk sykdom, mangel på døgnrytme og farmakologisk påvirkning. Predisponerende faktorer som demens eller kognitiv dysfunksjon, depresjon, alvorlig sykdom eller komorbiditet er også tilstede hos pasienten før sykehusinnleggelse (3, 4). Det er rapportert om delirium hos nær 87% av alle respiratorbehandlede pasienter. Ubehandlet delirium kan påvirke pasientens kliniske tilstand, og føre til redusert kontinuitet i behandlingen, lengre behandlingstid, økte kostnader og i verste fall økt mortalitet (5). Pasientens adferd deles inn i hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium, eller en kombinasjon av begge tilstandene. Hyperaktivt delirium er klassisk beskrevet som at pasienten er aggressive og utagerende, og ute av stand til å samarbeide. Hypoaktivt delirium viser seg ved svekket oppmerksomhet og bevissthet, og nedsatt psykomotorisk aktivitet. Det er høyest forekomst av pasienter i hypoaktivt delirium. På grunn av vage symptomer er det vanskeligere å avdekke. Dette fører til at langtidsprognosen for pasienter med hypoaktivt delirium er dårlig (5, 6). Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) er et validert kartleggingsverktøy som benyttes for å avdekke tilstanden hos intuberte pasienter som ikke kan kommunisere verbalt (4, 7, 8). Rutinemessig screening med et slikt kartleggingsverktøy for å avdekke delirium er anbefalt. Likevel viser forskning at tilstanden er underdiagnostisert (9, 10).",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "title": "Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency, characterized by continuous or intermittent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, which can result in death or neurologic sequelae. In about one-third of patients, SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The two most important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE (Neligan & Shorvon, 2008). With respect to etiology, acute structural brain disorders (e.g., encephalitis, stroke, and trauma) resulting in SE in previously nonepileptic patients are particularly likely to be refractory. Conversely, in cases of acute SE in previously nonepileptic patients, for which no etiology is found, the outcome is usually much better. With respect to duration of SE, the longer the seizure persists (typically >1 h), the more likely is the seizure to be unresponsive to AED therapy, the higher is the mortality, and the worse is the prognosis in survivors. Similar observations have been reported in rat models of SE. In rats, SE can be induced with chemical agents or by electrical stimulation. Chemical models of SE include systemic administration of the convulsants kainic acid or pilocarpine, whereas electrical models include hippocampal or amygdala stimulation via depth electrodes. In such models, seizures rapidly become self-sustaining and continue long after the withdrawal of the convulsive stimulus. Various molecular and functional changes are thought to play a role in the transition from single seizures to self-sustained SE and in the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance in rat SE models (Chen & Wasterlain, 2006; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These changes include alterations in the functional properties of hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and enhanced trafficking of GABAA receptors (or receptor subunits) from the synaptic membrane to the cytosol, resulting in a loss of GABA-mediated inhibition. At the same time, glutamate receptor subunits, including alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, move to the synaptic membrane where they form additional excitatory receptors. These changes are likely to explain progressive resistance to AEDs acting on GABAA receptors, whereas anticonvulsant NMDA or AMPA antagonists remain highly effective in terminating SE (Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These findings, however, do not easily explain resistance to AEDs, such as phenytoin, that do not primarily act via GABA receptors. It is conceivable that AED targets other than GABA or glutamate receptors are also affected by sustained seizure activity. For instance, molecular and functional changes in voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are targets of phenytoin and various other major AEDs, have been found after a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats (Ellerkmann et al., 2003; Remy & Beck, 2006). Furthermore, a decrease in surface expression of potassium channels has been described after prolonged SE (Lugo et al., 2008). Another explanation for the progressive loss of AED efficacy with ongoing SE activity would be increased expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood–brain barrier, which would decrease brain concentrations of AEDs that are substrates for Pgp (Löscher, 2007). However, recent experiments in two rat models of SE did not result in any evidence supporting this possibility (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008; Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). Pgp expression at brain capillary endothelial cells was not increased during or shortly after SE, but only 2 days following SE. This was substantiated by studying the mRNA expression of the genes (Mdr1a, Mdr1b) encoding for Pgp in rats. Furthermore, the selective Pgp inhibitor, tariquidar, did not counteract resistance of a pilocarpine-induced SE to phenobarbital or phenytoin (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). In our hands, the only effective treatment for terminating a pilocarpine-induced SE was a combination of phenobarbital and diazepam (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008), which may be explained by the fact that phenobarbital, in addition to modulating GABAA receptors, blocks glutamatergic excitation at AMPA/kainate receptors (Rogawski & Löscher, 2004), so that combining these two AEDs results in a synergistic effect on GABAA receptors plus an antiglutamatergic effect. Other potential mechanisms of drug resistance of SE include induction of proinflammatory mediators and neuronal damage. SE has been shown to induce cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); complement; and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, that is, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins in the brain (Vezzani & Granata, 2005). The induction of these mediators may be involved in alterations in the blood–brain barrier, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and neuronal degeneration, all of which may affect AED efficacy. However, at least in our hands, induction of proinflammatory mediators by SE did not develop rapidly enough to explain resistance of SE to AEDs (Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). These alterations, however, may be critically involved in the development of epilepsy and neuronal damage after SE, as indicated by the disease-modifying effects of treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, administered after a pilocarpine-induced SE (Jung et al., 2006). Interestingly, neurodegeneration developing after SE could be significantly reduced or prevented by treatment with the NMDA-antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine), administered together with diazepam after kainate- or pilocarpine-induced SE (Brandt et al., 2003; Bankstahl et al., 2008), substantiating that SE-induced release of glutamate is involved in brain damage. Therefore, combining diazepam with an NMDA antagonist such as ketamine may not only be an advantageous treatment for terminating SE (Martin & Kapur, 2008; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008), but may also prevent part of the long-term consequences of SE. Apart from molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the severity of SE may play a role in the response to AED treatment. We recently demonstrated in rats that SE induced by pilocarpine was more resistant to AEDs than an electrically induced SE, and also induced more severe brain damage than determined in the electrical model (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). So one may speculate that drug resistance, at least in part, is a mere expression of higher SE severity (and/or the severity of the underlying condition), rather than of molecular or functional alterations developing as a result of sustained seizure activity. In conclusion, mechanisms of drug resistance in SE are only incompletely understood. Important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE, but several other variables may be involved, including disease-related, patient-related, and drug-related factors (Table 1). Initiating treatment of SE with two drugs that have different mechanisms of action (e.g., a benzodiazepine plus a barbiturate or an NMDA antagonist) might increase chances of success. It is hoped that a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in refractory SE might help us to improve its treatment.

First, the multidimensional assessment of suicidal risk defines the areas of interference with various axis I or axis II disorders, but also with the complex psychosocial environment of such patients. The therapeutic approach must be adapted by taking into account various factors (i.e. gender, age group, degree of social exclusion, etc.). Furthermore, case management must take into account the type of suicidal behavior (acute suicidal crisis or chronic suicidal state), this typology being dependent on the link with axis I disorders, more frequent in acute suicidal crisis, or with disorders belonging axis II, more common in chronic, repetitive suicidal behavior.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex.

Mental symptoms were present in 25 of these cases. 2. The deficiency is termed a \"neurometabolic crisis.\" It may be caused by absolute or relative avitaminosis, by starvation of various origins or by endocrine factors. 3. Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

Diagnosis of major depression in old age could also could be a challenge, due to aspects like (1) there is a higher vulnerability to the stigma of depression in this population, (2) hypochondriac ideation and somatic symptoms are the main symptoms, while depressive disposition or anhedonia are under-reported by such patients, (3) differential diagnosis includes various organic diseases, but also several psychiatric disorders, like neurocognitive disorders, organic affective disorders, drug induced affective disorders etc. Reduction of social relationships caused by retirement and loss of spouse and friends, as well as a decrease of personal income could precipitate or maintain depressive disorders during late-life. Quality of life in patients diagnosed with depressive major disorders is a rarely monitored parameter, although its importance for case management could not be overemphasized. A reduction of life quality correlates with a poorer functional prognosis, persistence of neglected residual symptoms, low adherence to treatment plan.",

En 1955, Bedford estudio a 120 pacientes ancianos que desarrollaron demencia en el periodo postoperatorio; aunque este problema ha sido reconocido desde el siglo XVI aparecieron los primeros reportes en 1819. Cuenta con diversos sinonimos tales como: estado desconcertante agudo, sindrome de cerebro agudo, disfuncion mental, etc. La demencia es un sindrome definido por un deterioro cognitivo global con repercusion funcional, sin afectacion de la conciencia. Se caracteriza por un inicio gradual y curso progresivo. Puede ser dificil distinguir entre demencia y delirium debido a que muchas veces coexisten. Hasta un 50% de las demencias tienen un delirium asociado al ingreso y entre 25-50% de los pacientes con delirium tienen una demencia de base. Los principales rasgos para diferenciar ambos trastornos son: Inicio y curso: en el delirium los sintomas comienzan rapida y bruscamente, desarrollandose en horas o dias, mientras que en la demencia el curso es lentamente progresivo, de meses. Estado de la conciencia: en la demencia el individuo se mantiene alerta con poca o ninguna alteracion de la conciencia al contrario del delirium. En la actualidad, el delirio postoperatorio es una entidad bien definida (Cuadro I). La incidencia en ancianos va de 10% a 60%; en estudios recientes han incluido a las poblaciones quirurgicas oftalmicas, ortopedicas, y cardiacas. Diversos autores han destacado la correlacion del delirio postoperatorio con la hipoxemia perioperatoria y recomiendan la supervision electroencefalografica durante la cirugia(1-3). Se han realizado multiples esfuerzos para encontrar nuevas pruebas para un diagnostico temprano del delirio postoperatorio. La disfuncion mental transitoria tiene un importante efecto sobre la salud del paciente y por lo tanto se incrementan los costos para mantener el cuidado de ellos.

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "abstract": "Con el nombre de demencia se denomina un sindrome complejo de naturaleza organica, adquirido, caracterizado por la presencia de un deterioro permanente de la memoria y otras funciones intelectuales, frecuentemente acompanado de otras manifestaciones psicopatologicas y alteraciones del comportamiento, que ocurre sin afectacion del nivel de conciencia ni depresion, y afecta al funcionamiento laboral y/o social del sujeto. La demencia es un sindrome clinico de etiologia multiple, por lo general de curso cronico y progresivo, pero no necesariamente irreversible. El principal factor de riesgo para las formas mas comunes de demencia, como la enfermedad de Alzheimer, es el envejecimiento. La demencia bien establecida afecta al 8% de las personas de edad igual o superior a 65 anos. Para una poblacion estimada en Espana de 7.576.309 de personas es este grupo de edad, podemos establecer una cifra de sujetos afectados que sobrepasa holgadamente el medio millon. Esta cifra puede doblarse si consideramos tambien las formas leves de sindrome demencial. Hasta el 75% de las personas mayores que residen en una institucion padecen alguna forma de deterioro cognitivo clinicamente significativo, un sindrome demencial en la mayoria de los casos. La tasa de conversion de pacientes con demencia leve o deterioro cognitivo significativo a casos confirmados de demencia se situa en el 10-12% anual. Las enfermedades que cursan con demencia imponen una sobrecarga intensa sobre los pacientes y sus cuidadores, lo que las transforma en uno de los problemas sociosanitarios mas acuciantes en nuestro pais. Las entidades que pueden dar lugar a una demencia son muy numerosas. Suelen considerarse 3 grandes grupos etiologicos: demencias degenerativas primarias (p. ej., enfermedad de Alzheimer); demencias secundarias (p. ej., demencia vascular) y demencias combinadas o de multiple etiologia (p. ej., demencia mixta o demencia tipo Alzheimer con enfermedad cerebrovascular asociada). La forma de demencia mas comun es la enfermedad de Alzheimer (60%), seguida de la demencia vascular (15-20%) y la demencia asociada a la enfermedad de Parkinson (10-15%). Estas formas mas frecuentes de demencia son irreversibles, pero hay que tener en cuenta que un 5-10% de las demencias son potencialmente reversibles, y entre ellas hay que destacar las asociadas al empleo de farmacos. El resto de las etiologias son infrecuentes y por lo tanto irrelevantes desde la practica en atencion primaria. Siguiendo el esquema propuesto por el Consenso Canadiense de Demencias, se exponen a continuacion las situaciones clinicas caracteristicas que suelen presentarse en atencion primaria, junto con una pauta de actuacion basada en los conocimientos actuales.",

      "abstract": "Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) is a chronic, potentially disabling psychotic disorder common in clinical settings. SAD often has been used as a diagnosis for individuals having an admixture of mood and psychotic symptoms whose diagnosis is uncertain. Its hallmark is the presence of symptoms of a major mood episode (either a depressive or manic episode) concurrent with symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech.A literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to identify articles on SAD. We also reviewed major textbooks and DSM-5 to identify pertinent information.This review begins with the history and classification of SAD. Debate continues to swirl around the concept, as some experts view SAD as an independent disorder, while others see SAD as either a form of schizophrenia or a mood disorder. The disorder is more common in women and its course follows the middle ground between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SAD appears to have high heritability. Most patients appear to benefit from antipsychotics plus antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers, depending on whether the patient has the depressive or bipolar subtype. Electroconvulsive therapy can also be effective.SAD is a chronic psychotic disorder that continues to be controversial. There has been inadequate research regarding its epidemiology, course, etiologic factors, and treatment.",

      "title": "Recovery Versus Remission in Schizophrenia and Related Persistent Psychotic Disorders: no Contrasting but Complementary Models",
      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics.

      "title": "Sintomi Psichici e Somatici dei Disturbi dell'Umore: razionali di terapia",
      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Responsabilidad penal del drogodependiente",
      "abstract": "Tradicionalmente se han venido distinguiendo dos grandes tipologias de criminalidad relacionadas con las drogas, la delincuencia funcional y la delincuencia inducida. En ambos casos de criminalidad la causa de la delincuencia es el consumo de drogas. El Codigo penal de 1995 presta especial atencion al problema del consumo y la dependencia de las drogas aportando una regulacion especifica sobre la incidencia que sobre la capacidad de culpabilidad tiene el consumo y la dependencia de las drogas. La eximente de intoxicacion requiere tres elementos: Un presupuesto biologico o psiquiatrico, un estado de intoxicacion en el momento de cometer el delito un componente psicologico, imposibilidad de comprender el caracter ilicito de su conducta o de actuar conforme a ese conocimiento y un requisito\nnegativo, que la intoxicacion no haya sido provocada con el proposito de cometer el delito o que el sujeto haya previsto o debido prever que en estado de intoxicacion podria cometer un delito. El sindrome de abstinencia es una alteracion psiquica que se caracteriza por un sindrome especifico, que viene determinado por la clase de sustancia, debido al cese o reduccion del consumo prolongado de esa sustancia. El estado carencial crea una presion motivacional que explica la falta de libertad en el proceso de determinacion de la voluntad para actuar conforme a la norma. La adiccion a sustancias psicoactivas se define como un estado psiquico y fisico determinado por el consumo continuado de droga durante un periodo de tiempo, que se caracteriza por la perdida del control en el uso de la susta\nncia. La introduccion de la atenuante de grave adiccion supone reconocer que el consumo de drogas reiterado puede ocasionar una adiccion a las sustancias, que influye en la capacidad volitiva del sujeto limitando de forma relevante su\ncapacidad de actuar conforme a la norma dado la compulsion al consumo de esa sustancia. Desde esta concepcion de la grave adiccion lo coherente hubiera sido reconocer a la grave adiccion como un supuesto de semi-imputabilidad y no como una mera atenuante de la culpabilidad. Lo que permitiria, sin necesidad de acudir a la analogia in bonam partem, aplicar al adicto la medida de seguridad de tratamiento de deshabituacion.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "title": "Status epilepticus: Refractory and super-refractory",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is an important neurological emergency. It is defined as seizures lasting for 5 minutes or more or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness to baseline between the attacks. Refractory SE (RSE) is defined as SE persisting despite sufficient dose of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug (AED), irrespective of time. Super refractory SE (SRSE) is defined as SE that continues for 24 hours or more after the use of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on weaning of the anesthestic agent. RSE occurs in 23%–48% of the patients and SRSE in approximately 22% of the patients with SE. In general, RSE occurs in patients with new-onset seizures rather than in patients with chronic epilepsy. The etiology of RSE in developing countries is dominated by central nervous system (CNS) infections and head injury compared to stroke and drug withdrawal in the developed countries. The treatment of RSE and SRSE is not evidence based. Following benzodiazepines, the second line antiepileptic drugs include sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and anesthetic drugs such as midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol. Most intravenous anesthetic drugs produce hypotension and respiratory suppression; therefore, patients with RSE are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In RSE patients, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression with interburst interval of 2–20 s or even flat EEG has been tried. Recently, concerns have been raised on the safety of burst suppression in RSE and SRSE. The paucity of ICUs in developing countries limits the use of these management protocols. There is a need to explore intravenous AEDs with safer cardiovascular and respiratory profile for the management of SE.",

      "abstract": "The term asthenia comes from the Greek (centsqsneia, a: privation, without; esthénos: vigor, force), it means absence of strength, vigor or force. It is a symptom, difficult to define, with a set of vague sensations, different for each patient. It is a frequent cause of consult, almost 30% in ambulatory settings. The chronic fatigue represents up to 10% of these cases, and the 0.2-0.7% belongs to the chronic fatigue syndrome. It is very important to differentiate asthenia from weakness, dizziness or dyspnoea, since patients may confuse them. The factor time in asthenia is very useful for its characterization, it was defined to the prolonged fatigue when it lasts for more than a month and chronic when the duration is greater than 6 months. The depression is the commonest fatigue cause, representing approximately half of the cases. The most effective treatment of the asthenia is to solve the underlying cause, although up to 20% of the patients remain without diagnosis. The diagnosis of the chronic fatigue syndrome is of exclusion and the criteria of the international consensus of year 1994 are due to use. The high frequency of the symptom entails an enormous social and economic cost and it is for that reason so important for physicians to have a correct manage of this symptom.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..). Este tipo de depresiones tienden a la cronici- dad y al deterioro funcional, y por tanto se recomienda el tratamiento de las mismas. Inicialmente una conducta expectante espe- rando una remision espontanea, asociar psi- coterapia, actividad fisica y, si se considera necesario, tratamiento antidepresivo. EnglishDepression in elderly are associated with somes factors like physical, functional, so- cial, and psychological consequences that can be maintained over time, even after the improvement of affective symptomatology. It is considered that in more than three quar- ters of elderly depressed may persist, giving rise to postdepressive states in the form of minor depressions, sub-threshold depres- sions or subsyndromic depressions. Among these most prevalents residual symptoms in postdepressive states are difficulties of con- centration, bradipsychia, asthenia, somatic symptoms, sleep disorders or hypochondria- sis. In elderly people, subclinical or subsyn- dromal depressions are more prevalent, which frequently appear after the improvement of a major depressive disorder. The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..). This form of depression tends to chronici- ty and functional impairment, and therefore treatment is recommended.

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "abstract": "The chapter focuses on the relationship of negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenia. Negative symptoms should be evaluated in a relation to positive symptoms both cross-sectionally and long term (prospectively/retrospectively). Two types of long-term interaction between negative and positive symptoms could be distinguished: (1) relatively synchronized, and (2) relatively desynchronized. Synchronization of negative and positive symptoms is characterized by their unidirectional long-term course. Desynchronization is characterized by their bidirectional long-term relations: (1) negative schizophrenia with minimal positive symptoms at the beginning of the disease and further progression of negative symptoms; or (2) schizophrenia with negative symptoms ‘that stopped at the very beginning’, and the later course is characterized by positive symptoms. Considering every single time point of the long-term relationship between negative and positive symptoms (cross-sectionally), the chapter describes the concept of ‘mutual/common syndromes’ (consisting of both positive and negative symptoms) at different stages of schizophrenia, including residual deficit states.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "abstract": "The group of 186 anxiety disorders patients were observed. In all them anxiety and phobic disorders were non-psychotic level, associated with acute hard emotional stress, or long term psycho-emotional stress. They include phobic disorders – 31 patients, panic disorder- 69 patients, generalized anxiety disorder-29 patients, mixed anxiety disorder-38 patients, obsessive compulsive disorder-19 patients. By the anamnesis observation was shown contributing factors to the performing anxiety and phobic disorders include mental illnesses (primarily neurotic and depressive disorders); heredity; presence of organic predisposition as perinatal, prenatal (birth asphyxia) and postnatal (cerebrocranial injury, neurological infection, acute and chronic intoxication) kinds of brain damage; personality features: anxious-hypochondriac, anancastic features; a history of neurotic and depressive disorders; psycho-emotional stress in the period preceding the disease. Clinical characteristics of various disorders are the most common for them; however, they are often shown in varying degrees of severity and may occur simultaneously (combined) or at different stages of the disease, acquiring clinical or subsyndromal forms. In clinical cases, a combination of various symptomatic complexes in the stage of independent disorders means comorbidity disorders. The main directions in the treatment of programed are the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy included the benzodiazepines and SSRI’s. Psychotherapy based on integrative model and included CBT and hypno-suggestive therapy. This therapy model aprobation analysis shown the high efficacy in 69% patients, middle range – in 16%, low – in 15% patients.",

The noun affect refers to feelings, emotions and mood. The most common affective disorders are depression, which is characterized by low or depressed mood. This chapter discusses these and the bipolar disorders, which are often characterized by extreme mood swings from heightened elation or mania to deep depression, or vice versa. It talks about clinical features of major depressive disorder (MDD), its subtypes, stress, learned helplessness and the causes and treatments for depression. Current management of MDD involves the use of antidepressant drugs together with psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Drugs that inhibit the synthesis of cortisol or inhibit the action of glutamate are presently under investigation for the use as antidepressant medication.",

      "title": "Delusions and the psychopathology of the elderly with dementia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

Durante ese ano, el monarca sufrio un rapido empeoramiento de sus condiciones mentales. La enfermedad generalmente ha sido atribuida a una condicion psiquiatrica primaria, generalmente por un trastorno bipolar. Desarrollo. Se realiza un estudio de investigacion en los archivos documentales espanoles y bibliotecas en busca de informacion clinica sobre la enfermedad de Fernando VI. Se realiza una evaluacion y discusion clinica de la enfermedad del rey sobre la base de la informacion obtenida. Conclusiones. El inicio del empeoramiento clinico del ultimo ano de Fernando VI empezo tras la muerte de su amada esposa. Los sintomas iniciales descritos pueden ser similares a los de un episodio depresivo mayor, sin embargo, el monarca sufrio un empeoramiento rapidamente progresivo con alteraciones de la personalidad, conductuales, encamamiento, perdida de control de esfinteres y crisis epilepticas. Los ultimos meses de su vida estuvo en un estado de postracion con un estado cognitivo compatible con una demencia grave. Por todo ello, aunque es posible que Fernando VI pudiera padecer previamente algun tipo de trastorno psiquiatrico, la enfermedad que le llevo a su muerte precoz seria compatible con lo que hoy conocemos como una demencia rapidamente progresiva.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome Without Overdose: Polypharmacy-Induced Toxicity in a Medically Stable Young Adult",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

      "title": "Affective symptoms and emerging psychotic disorder in adolescents",
      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are frequently reported during the period preceding the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents when such symptoms can be mistaken for those of mood disorder. However, it is unclear which emotional symptoms should be considered predictive of schizophrenia onset. The types of emotional disturbances that may precede schizophrenic disorder were sought through a review of historical descriptive studies and seminal works using a phenomenological approach. Five main types of emotional disturbances have been found as prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic disorder: (1) increased sensitivity to stress, (2) poor or incomplete expression of emotions, (3) reduced emotion sharing, (4) emotional detachment, and (5) disconnection between the perception and expression of emotions. Studies based on phenomenological views of schizophrenic disorders stressed the chronological sequence of these symptoms in the same person. For example, the term “delusional mood” (Wahnstimmung) coined to describe changes in the perceived atmosphere encompass mood disturbances from subtle emotional overreactivity to more severe symptoms that could evoke athymhormia. Analysis of recent studies among subjects at high-risk for psychotic transition showed that the presence of mood symptoms at a very early stage of the disorder is common. While these symptoms predict a lower level of general functioning, they were not associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder at follow-up. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. After many advances in the field, several unanswered questions remain for optimal treatment after the early stage of SE. This narrative review describes some of the important drug trials for SE treatment that have shaped the understanding of the treatment of SE. The authors also propose possible clinical trial designs for the later stages of SE that may allow assessment of currently available and new treatment options. Status epilepticus can be divided into four stages for treatment purposes: early, established, refractory, and superrefractory. Ongoing convulsive seizures for more than 5 minutes or nonconvulsive seizure activity for more than 10 to 30 minutes is considered early SE. Failure to control the seizure with first-line treatment (usually benzodiazepines) is defined as established SE. If SE continues despite treatment with an antiseizure medicine, it is considered refractory SE, which is usually treated with additional antiseizure medicines or intravenous anesthetic agents. Continued seizures for more than 24 hours despite use of intravenous anesthetic agents is termed superrefractory SE. Evidence-based treatment recommendations from high-quality clinical trials are available for only the early stages of SE. Among the challenges for designing a treatment trial for the later stages SE is the heterogeneity of semiology, etiology, age groups, and EEG correlates. In many instances, SE is nonconvulsive in later stages and diagnosis is possible only with EEG. EEG patterns can be challenging to interpret and only recently have consensus criteria for EEG diagnosis of SE emerged. Despite having these EEG criteria, interrater agreement in EEG interpretation can be challenging. Defining successful treatment can also be difficult. Finally, the ethics of randomizing treatment and possibly using a placebo in critically ill patients must also be considered. Despite these challenges, clinical trials can be designed that navigate these issues and provide useful answers for how best to treat SE at various stages.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "La maggior parte dei crimini con violenza sulla persona non avviene, come sembrerebbe ad un’analisi superficiale, in modo improvviso, come un «fulmine a ciel sereno», ma segue varie «tappe progressive», non sempre facili da identificare ma indispensabili per una comprensione del crimine e soprattutto per la sua prevenzione. La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc.

These include acute stress disorder (ASD), feelings of depression and guilt, and other anxiety reactions, such as panic attacks. The essential features of ASD are similar to those of PTSD. ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

Many with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder present initially to their primary care clinician. Effective treatment is possible in a busy primary care setting; therapy involves patient education and pharmacotherapy. Once other potential causes of symptoms of an anxiety disorder have been ruled out, the first step is to reassure the patient that he or she has a psychological condition-a very common one-and that symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed disease or going crazy or losing control. Educate and inform patients that complete clinical remission is achievable, often with medication alone. Begin treatment on day 1 with a long-acting benzodiazepine-such as alprazolam XR or clonazepam-or with the anxiolytic agent buspirone; at the same time, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The anxiolytic agent allays acute somatic symptoms until the full effects of the SSRI are manifest (often 4 to 6 weeks). The anxiolytic can then be gradually tapered. Referral to a psychiatrist for psychotherapy may be indicated when a patient refuses or cannot tolerate drug therapy, or when response to therapy is inadequate.",

Prodromal symptoms were assessed with the scale of prodromal symptoms (SOPS) developed by Mc Glashan. It is a heteroquestionnaire for patients and their parents. The mean duration of prodromal phase was about 2 years with extremes ranging from 6 months to 4 years. The most severe prodromal symptoms were suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas, social isolation, dysphoric mood and impaired tolerance to normal stress The most frequent prodromal symptoms were impaired tolerance to normal stress, dysphoric mood, sleep disturbance, social isolation and suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas. We have not found any difference between male and female. The prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia found in the Tunisian socio cultural context are similar to those found in other countries.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Urticaria is a condition characterized by the development of wheals (hives), angioedema, or both. Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as the presence of urticaria for a period exceeding 6 weeks, assuming symptoms for most days of the week. It is divided into chronic inducible urticarias and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), previously termed chronic idiopathic urticaria. The latter designation emphasizes that patients can experience urticaria independent of any exogenous stimulus even if one can define circumstances that may worsen symptoms. Approximately 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report accompanying episodes of angioedema, whereas 10% have angioedema as their primary manifestation. In most cases, it is a self-limiting disorder, persisting for 2 to 5 years in most cases, although 20% of patients suffer for more than 5 years. Objective To assess the severity of CSU; screen CSU patients for psychiatric illnesses i.e. Anxiety and Depression and to assess the severity of Anxiety and Depression in patients with CSU. Patients and Methods This was a cross-sectional analytical study that was conducted at allergy clinic Ain-Shams University Hospitals on 300 patients with chronic urticarial, Study Period was 6 months. Results Our study revealed that, there were statically significant Positive correlation Between UAS score and GHQ (Anxiety) score, GHQ (Depression) score, BDI score and HAS score. In this study, there was highly statistically significant difference between HAS level and UAS level. There was highly statistically significant difference between BDI level and UAS level. Conclusion Our data show that patients with CSU experience high rates of anxiety and depression. CSU disease activity affects the severity of depression. CSU patients with high disease activity should be explored for comorbid depression. Females were more likely than men to have CUS and more affected by anxiety and depression than males.",

      "title": "Secondary Mania in Older Adults: a case report and review of literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction Although mania is commonly associated with bipolar disorder, it can have many etiologies. Thus, “primary mania” results from bipolar disorder, whereas “secondary mania” results from pharmacological, metabolic, or neurologic causes. Older adults are at risk for secondary mania because of increased medical comorbidities and neurological changes. In one retrospective study of 50 patients with mania who were older than 65 years, it was the first manic episode for 28% of the patients and 71% had a comorbid neurological disorder. Objectives The etiology of mania is important because although acute symptomatic treatment of both primary and secondary mania may be similar, appropriate treatment of secondary mania includes addressing the cause. We present here two case histories of secondary mania in older adults, discuss their presentations and differential diagnosis in turn, and discuss treatment. Methods We will present a clinical case of a patient. Ms. A, a 63-year-old divorced woman with no prior medical or psychiatric history, was seen for an acute manic episode with mixed features. She was in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before admission, when she presented with a status epilepticus requiring a one-week hospitalization in the neurology département and treated by Carbamazepine. She then developed an abnormally excited and labile mood, motor excitability accompanied by rapid thoughts, with a total loss of desire and pleasure and thoughts of death. Results In our study, the patient presented a manic episode with mixed characteristics secondary to a status epilepticus. The patient was treated both somatically and psychologically, and the evolution was positive. The patient was stabilised after being put on an antiepileptic drug associated with an antipsychotic drug. In our study, the patient presented with a manic attack with mixed characteristics secondary to a status epilepticus.The patient was treated both somatically and psychologically, and the evolution was favourable. The patient was stabilised after being put on an antiepileptic drug associated with an antipsychotic drug. Conclusions Late onset psychiatric disorders often represent a challenge for the psychiatrists as far as the diagnosis and management issues are concerned. The elderly patients have generally been reported to have associated medical, especially neurological illnesses and are also prone to side effects of various psychotropic medications.

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition lasting more than 30 minutes in which continuous or recurrent seizure activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is responsible for diverse clinical symptoms including alteration of mental state, abnormal behaviour, perception disturbances or consciousness impairment. Most authors recognize two types of NCSE depending on the ictal electroencephalographic changes: generalized (absence status epilepticus) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). In addition, there is also a simple form of partial status which is likely underdiagnosed because of its frequent progression to CPSE, subtle and varied symptomatology and high proportion of normal electroencephalograms (EEG). Absence status epilepticus (ASE) may occur in different clinical situations including idiopathic generalized epilepsy (typical AS), symptomatic generalized epilepsy (atypical AS), and elderly subjects without antecedents of epilepsy on chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs (de novo AS of late onset). Furthermore, CPSE is more frequent than previously mentioned. Although initially was equated with temporal lobe status epilepticus, extratemporal cases of CPSE have been well-documented, and the electroclinical characteristics of two types (I and II) of frontal CPSE have been recently described. NCSE may occur in patients with diverse clinical diagnosis such as hypoxic-anoxic encephalopathy, cancer, drugs, autoimmune disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, chromosomal alterations, peritoneal dialysis, infections, cerebral hamartomas or head trauma.The identification of NCSE may be particularly arduous and, therefore, a high level of suspicion is essential to obtain an early diagnosis. An urgent EEG with administration of intravenous benzodiazepines is considered as the method of choice in the diagnostic evaluation of NCSE.",

Among SAD patients, major depressive disorder is the most common diagnosis, bipolar II is less common, and bipolar I is rare. The average age of onset for SAD is 23 to 27 years, but SAD has also been observed in children and adolescents (Magnusson &amp; Partonen, 2005).",

A similar procedure should occur in the psychiatric evaluation of, say, a patient with depression, first looking for secondary causes, such as Cushing's syndrome, before considering a diagnosis of one of the idiopathic causes, shch as major depressive disorder.

Social anxiety disorder is the most frequent anxiety disorder (10-15%) that occurs in two subtypes--generalized and specific. It is a disorder that occurs during the adolescence and reflects negatively to the quality of life of an individual. Neurobiological basis of this disorder has not been explored yet. The disorder is frequently burdened with comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression and substance-related disorders. Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy. The medicaments of choice in the treatment of social anxiety disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Anxiolytics should be used only as a supplementary in the acute phase. Treatment of social anxiety disorder should last at least 3 months up to one year.",

The etymological meaning of Unmada is \"a state of disturbed mental functions.\" Kaphaja Unmada is one among the five types of Unmada, which is caused by the aggravation of Kapha dosha. The description of Kaphaja Unmada is available in all classical texts of Ayurveda along with its symptomatology. Previous works have correlated \"Kaphaja Unmada\" with \"depressive disorder\"/\"depression\"/\"major depressive disorder.\" The symptomatology of Kaphaja Unmada and depressive disorder is 70% similar, but some of the signs and symptoms of Kaphaja Unmada such as laala sighanaka sravanam, swapna nityata, svayathuranane, shukla stimita malopadigdha akshata, naari priyata, chhardi, balam cha bhukte, ushnasevi, nakhadi shauklyam, kasa, and raatrau bhrisham are not seen in depressive disorders and they denote hypersomnia, puffiness of face, pernicious or megaloblastic anemia, hypersexual behavior, vomiting, nocturnal and postprandial aggravation, cold intolerance, depression, and dementia conditions which are due to the underlying hypothyroidism instead of depression only. These signs and symptoms can be explained in a better way when Kaphaja Unmada is compared with myxedema/hypothyroidism with depression. The present study considers that Kaphaja Unmada is more similar with hypothyroidism with depression/myxedema madness/myxedema psychosis than primary depression/typical depression alone.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

El TDAH representa actualmente uno de los motivos de consulta psicologica y psicopedagogica mas frecuente, estimandose una incidencia que oscila entre 3 y 5 % de los ninos en edad escolar. Es un sindrome muy complejo con caracteristicas sintomaticas muy amplias y variadas, por este motivo su diagnostico tambien resulta complejo Durante la etapa diagnostica, un aspecto fundamental, es diferenciar la presencia del TDAH de otros trastornos que suelen aparecer de manera asociada; es lo que se denomina comorbilidad. Una cuestion que no debe perderse de vista para entender el problema de la comorbilidad es que tanto el TDAH como la mayoria de los trastornos a los que se asocia no son entidades discretas, sino que se trata de dimensiones conductuales que se distribuyen segun un modelo continuo. El trastorno no representa otra cosa que el extremo de dicho continuo. Los trastornos que aparecen mas frecuentemente asociados al TDAH son: Trastornos de conducta, trastornos de aprendizaje, trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo, trastornos de ansiedad, entre otros. Si atendemos a los diversos sintomas y manifestaciones que se hallan en los ninos con TDAH, llegaremos facilmente a la conclusion de que la forma mas rara de TDAH es la que se exhibe en forma aislada, es decir, limitada a las manifestaciones propias del trastorno. Cuando se atiende a un nino con TDAH, si el diagnostico se limita a dicho trastorno, existen altas probabilidades de que pasemos por alto otros problemas. El presente trabajo busca configurar, a partir de los datos obtenidos, el estado del arte en lo referido a la comorbilidad del TDAH para alcanzar una comprension mas acabada del mismo y contribuir a un diagnostico exhaustivo que considere los distintos factores en juego.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë.

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders affecting children and adolescents. The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) is defined as prolonged continuous or discontinuous clusters of epileptic myoclonus, with or without impairment of consciousness. 1 MSE is a heterogeneous condition that has been described in generalized epilepsy syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, toxic-metabolic states, and following anoxic brain injury. 2Acute symptomatic MSE usually occurs after prolonged anoxia or metabolic insults. 1 Except for acute symptomatic seizures, MSE is rarely reported in patients who do not have a history of epilepsy. 1This case study explores MSE of unknown etiology in an elderly patient who did not have a history of seizures.A 76-year-old woman presented with sudden clusters of irregular myoclonic twitching without impairment of consciousness, which had developed 1 day prior to seeking treatment.The myoclonic jerks had first appeared in the lower face and spread bilaterally to the shoulders and upper arms.They occurred with a high frequency (more than dozens of times per minute), and each cluster lasted a few seconds.The patient denied any history of seizures or morning jerks.She suffered from ischemic heart disease and had taken medications including nicorandil, aspirin, clopidogrel, and pravastatin several years previously.She did not report any other medical illness or additional medications, and denied any history of withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines.The patient was alert and oriented during her myoclonic jerks.She had experienced mild memory difficulties during the previous several years, but she reported no impairment in the activities of daily living.Laboratory findings were unremarkable, including the levels of glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the findings of liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and arterial blood gas.Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed no acute abnormality (Fig. 1A).Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral subcortical ischemic lesions (Fig. 1B).Gradient echo imaging did not reveal any hemorrhagic lesions or microbleeds (Fig. 1C).Electroencephalogram (EEG) displayed abundant bursts of high-voltage generalized polyspikes with a normal background.In addition, generalized asymmetric spikes were observed between or preceding the bursts (Fig. 1E).Myoclonic movements were time-locked with the bursts of generalized polyspikes.The patient was initially treated intravenously with a loading dose of valproic acid (800 mg), followed by the oral administration of valproic acid (900 mg/day) beginning the next day.The myoclonic seizures almost completely resolved after single intravenous valproic acid infusion.The patient received oral valproic acid for 1 year and remained free of myoclonic seizures after valproic acid was discontinued up to the follow-up examination conducted after 3 years.This case was an elderly patient who presented with late-onset MSE without any previous history of epilepsy.Except in generalized epilepsy syndromes (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy), MSE is usually associated with anoxic ischemic injury,",

      "title": "Neuroimaging Data in Bipolar Disorder: An Updated View",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBD is a prevalent mood disorder, often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions and frequently misdiagnosed (Altamura et al., 2011a).Intense emotional states that occur in BD comprise manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episodes.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, IV th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), BD spectrum ranges from cyclothymia to Bipolar I, Bipolar II Disorder and Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) forms.BD can also be conceptualized as a gradual change in mood scale, which ranges from severe depression to severe mania with an intermediate euthymic state or balanced mood.Dysthymia is a chronic state of mild low mood occurring for a minimum of two years.At the other end of the scale there is hypomania and severe mania.An alternative and broader dimensional approach conceptualizes BD as a continuum, between unipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder (which is considered by some authors a subcategory of BD) and schizophrenia.This theory may be supported from a clinical point of view by the fact that, sometimes, during severe manic, mixed or depressive episodes, bipolar patients experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions.It is also supported by the presence of morphometric alterations of frequent observation among major psychoses, such as enlarged ventricles and white matter volume reductions in the left and temporoparietal regions (Czobor et al., 2007).In BD, symptomatic states are frequently associated with poor working functioning and social impairment.Bipolar patients, moreover, have higher suicide rates than the general population and among the highest of psychiatric patients.In a recent study on factors predicting suicide in BD, white race, family history of suicide, and previous cocaine abuse were considered predictive of suicidal behaviour (Cassidy, 2011).Usually BD develops in early adulthood/late teens, with an age of onset ranging from 15 to 50 years (Cassano et al., 2006).International treatment guidelines for BD recommend the use of mood stabilizers -either in monotherapy or in association -as the gold standard in both acute and long-term therapy.The concept of stabilization, in fact, has been stressed as the ultimate objective of the treatment of BD, given the chronic and recurrent nature of the illness, which accounts for its significant levels of impairment and disability (Altamura et al., 2011b).Beyond the www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 264 aforementioned core mood symptoms and clinical features of BD, over the last decade, neurocognitive dysfunction has been stressed as another nuclear dimension of BD and, possibly, a marker of its underlying pathophysiology (Lewandowski et al., 2010).There is accumulating evidence that individuals with BD have neurocognitive impairment that persists even during euthymia: the degree of impairment is more severe in patients with depressive symptoms, with functions associated with processing speed and attentional control being particularly implicated (Chaves et al., 2011;Van der Werf-Eldering et al., 2010).In addition, in older euthimic adults with BD, resting-state corticolimbic dysregulation was related to sustained attention deficits and inhibitory control, which could reflect the cumulative impact of repeated affective episodes upon cerebral metabolism and neurocognitive performance (Brooks et al., 2011).Cognitive impairment in BD is influenced by the severity of illness (Yates et al., 2010).In addition, neuropsychological and imaging studies in BD suggested the presence of cognitive deficits and subtle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in limbic areas that may persist over euthymia.However, other studies are inconsistent with this claim.For example, a recent study did not identify any difference between BD patients and controls in levels of cognition over a two-year period, indicating that BD doesn't have a significant adverse impact on cognition (Delaloye et al., 2011).Neuroimaging has recently gained an important role both in clinical practice and research of psychiatric disorders, including BD. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have contributed to a deeper understanding of the structural changes in the brain in the context of psychiatric disorders.Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are techniques which measure changes in response to cognitive demand and/or connectivity between brain regions.As such, these approaches provide an opportunity for investigating the neural bases of behavioural and cognitive impairment in psychiatric populations, including BD. Structural neuroimaging Computed Tomography (CT)In the last two decades, the first important data about neuroanatomic abnormalities in BD were obtained by means of CT.More recently, the widespread use of MRI has brought several advantages over CT, particularly in terms of higher resolution of images of subcortical regions (Steffens, 1998).Although a typical pattern of abnormality has not been identified yet (Supprian, 2004), several brain structures were found to be affected in patients with BD according to imaging studies.CT provides excellent imaging data and rapid image acquisition at relatively low cost, it is widely available and more easily tolerated by patients, remaining the imaging modality of first choice in many clinical situations (Dougherty et al., 2004).CT consists of a series of slices or tomograms.Its measurements are performed at the periphery of the body.The image of each slice is acquired by means of an X-ray source and detectors positioned at 180 degrees on the other side of the body.By spinning the source and the detectors on one plane of the head, data are collected from multiple angles.A computer then processes X-ray attenuation measured from different points and uses specific algorithms to create a structural image within the plane.Ionic and non-ionic intravenous www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "espanolA pesar de ser un diagnostico fiable y valido, en las ultimas decadas ha habido una confusion en la terminologia utilizada para describir al trastorno delirante y una controversia acerca de la utilidad de clasificar el trastorno en subtipos segun el contenido. El principal objetivo de esta revision es resumir la evidencia en datos epidemiologicos, clinicos y resultados terapeuticos. La prevalencia del trastorno delirante es baja (0.03%) aunque es mas elevada en los servicios de urgencias y en poblacion penitenciaria. El fenomeno psicopatologico elemental del trastorno delirante es la significacion personal patologica o morbida que diferencia el “delirio del paranoico” del delirio del esquizofrenico o el delirio afectivo. Los estudios centrados en las trayectorias evolutivas del trastorno delirante describen tasas de estabilidad diagnostica cercanas al 80%. Autores clasicos definen dos fenotipos principales que pueden ser utiles para los clinicos: 1) Paranoia vera (similar al delirio interpretativo) y 2) Paranoia querulans (delirio reivindicativo). Existe una importante controversia acerca de la respuesta farmacologica en el trastorno delirante. La revision sistematica mas reciente reporta unas tasas de respuesta entre el 5-50%. Existe un escaso consenso sobre las definiciones operativas de la respuesta antipsicotica que podria explicar, en parte, la heterogeneidad de los datos. La identificacion de factores predictores de la respuesta antipsicotica en el trastorno delirante puede ayudar a mejorar los resultados clinicos. Son considerados factores moderadores de la respuesta: edad, genero, estado reproductivo, comorbilidad, estructura cerebral y variantes geneticas en genes que codifican para receptores dopaminergicos y proteinas implicadas en la metabolizacion de los psicofarmacos. Factores mediadores de la respuesta: niveles plasmaticos de antipsicoticos, cambios funcionales cerebrales y niveles hormonales. El problema de la adherencia terapeutica en estos pacientes es uno de los mayores desafios en el campo del trastorno delirante. EnglishDespite being considered a valid diagnosis, in the last decades there has been a great confusion concerning the terminology used to describe delusional disorder. Furthermore, the clinical utility of the classification according to the content of delusions has been found to be controversial. The aim of the present review is to summarize epidemiological, clinical and treatment outcomes in patients with delusional disorder. The prevalence of delusional disorder is low (0.03%), being higher in emergency departments and in prisons. The basic psychopathological phenomenon is the morbid or pathological significance, which differentiates “paranoia delusions” from delusions of schizophrenia or affective delusions. Studies focusing on clinical trajectories of delusional disorder report rates of diagnostic stability to be around 80%. Classical authors have defined two main phenotypes potentially useful for the clinicians: 1) Paranoia vera (similar to interpretative delusion) and 2) Paranoia querulans (litigant’s delusion); but the most important controversy remains response to treatment. A recent systematic review reports response rates between 5-50%. No consensus seems to exist with regard to the operational definition of antipsychotic response, a fact that may partly explain heterogeneity in response data. The identification of predictive factors of treatment response may help to improve clinical outcomes. Variables potentially moderating response in DD are age, gender, reproductive status, comorbidity, brain structure and genetic variants of dopaminergic receptors and drug metabolizing enzymes. Antipsychotic plasma levels, functional brain changes and hormonal levels are considered mediators of antipsychotics response. Therapeutic adherence in delusional disorder remains one of the major challenges in psychosis.",

La AS resulta en un deterioro psicosocial, financiero y familiar, ademas de medico como las lesiones en organos sexuales y contagio de infecciones de transmision sexual. La evidencia neurocientifica describe similitudes entre sexo adictos y adictos a substancias. Demostrando deterioro anatomicofuncional y neuropsicologico en las vias cerebrales implicadas en los procesos de recompensa, motivacion, afecto, inhibicion y cognicion. Este padecimiento no siempre es visto como una enfermedad por lo que los individuos que lo padecen no reciben siempre el tratamiento adecuado, de ahi la importancia para divulgar informacion en comunidades dedicadas a la atencion de la salud. EnglishSexual addiction (SA) formally called compulsive sexual behavior or hypersexuality disorder, is a condition in which exacerbated and inappropriate sexual behaviors and cognitions occur that generate discomfort and impairment in the function of one or more domains of life; with failure to control such behavior. SA results in psychosocial, financial and family deterioration, in addition to medical impairment such as injuries to sexual organs and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Neuroscientific evidence describes similarities between sex addicts and substance addicts. Demonstrating anatomical-functional and neuropsychological deterioration in the brain pathways involved in the processes of reward, motivation, affect, inhibition and cognition. This condition is not always seen as a disease, so individuals who suffer from it do not always receive adequate treatment, hence the importance of disseminating information in communities dedicated to health care.",

      "abstract": "Substance use disorders commonly co-occur with mood disorders (major depression, bipolar disorder) and may be due to the direct effects of illicit substances, such as intoxication and withdrawal, or due to effects stemming from chronic use, including substance-induced mood disorders. Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders. Some substances that have historically been used recreationally are being studied as possible treatments for mood disorders.",

The psychopathological structure of the first group of defect conditions primarily reflects the degree of the schizophrenia progression. Their time course in old age was limited to insignificant age-related modifications and decompensation.

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

It is a new concept that has been the focus of recent basic and therapeutic work, and is defined as “SE that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawl of anesthesia.” It is encountered typically, but not exclusively, in two quite distinctive clinical situations: (1) in patients with severe acute brain injury, and (2) in patients with no history of epilepsy in whom status epilepticus develops out of the blue with no overt cause. There are a variety of treatments used, almost entirely based on open observational studies or case reports. Therapy includes anesthesia, antiepileptic drug therapy, hypothermia and ICU therapy, other medical, immunological, and physical therapies. In this review, the range of possible therapies is outlined and an approach to therapy is discussed.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Comorbidités psychiatriques et résistance thérapeutique",
      "abstract": "La comorbidité psychiatrique est la règle plutôt que l’exception dans le cadre de la dépression majeure. 60 à 70 % des patients déprimés présentent au moins une comorbidité psychiatrique, et 30 à 40 % en ont au moins deux. Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment retrouvées sont les pathologies anxieuses, les addictions, et certains troubles ou traits de personnalité (borderline, neuroticisme) [1]. La présence de telles comorbidités compromet le pronostic de la maladie dépressive, avec une diminution des taux de rémission et de réponse aux traitements, un allongement du délai d’action, un tableau clinique plus sévère, une altération du fonctionnement et une chronicisation. Les comorbidités psychiatriques sont considérées comme un des facteurs participant à la résistance thérapeutique pour 20 à 30 % des épisodes [2]. Cette absence de réponse pourrait être plus particulièrement associée à certains sous-types et phénotypes cliniques de dépression poussant alors à la recherche de biomarqueurs spécifiques (électrophysiologiques, anatomiques et fonctionnels, métaboliques, et génétiques) de chacune de ces formes cliniques afin d’améliorer la compréhension même de la pathologie et son pronostic [3]. Par ailleurs, les recommandations ne définissent pas de stratégies précises en cas de dépressions avec comorbidités psychiatriques, les études randomisées, contrôlées classiquement menées ayant généralement tendance à exclure ces patients, et notamment ceux présentant une addiction associée. Il est néanmoins possible que le traitement de la dépression puisse améliorer le trouble comorbide, comme en témoigne la place aujourd’hui occupée par les antidépresseurs dans la pharmacothérapie des troubles anxieux [4]. Ces données soulèvent des questions cliniques, thérapeutiques et de recherche importantes, centrées sur une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque de la résistance en abordant le problème central de la comorbidité psychiatrique qu’il est essentiel de repérer dans le cadre d’une prise en charge globale du patient déprimé.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders can be broadly classified into: (a) insomnia, (b) parasomnia, (c) sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurologic and other medical disorders, and (d) proposed sleep disorders (e.g. pregnancy and menstrual related sleep disorders).1 Insomnia is a common encounter in primary care consultations2 and constitutes the commonest sleep problem3,4 that presents to the general practitioner. Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

Maniacal problems, similar to schizophrenia, include psychosis that normally influences you without precedent for the late teenager years or early adulthood. Youngsters are particularly prone to get it, yet specialists don't have the foggiest idea why. Indeed, even before what specialists call the principal scene of psychosis (FEP), you may show slight changes in the manner in which you act or think. This is known as the prodromal period and could last days, weeks, months, or even years. Some of the time you can put some distance between realities in any event, when you don't have an essential maniacal ailment like schizophrenia or bipolar problem.",

About half of primary care patients with hypochondriasis have symptoms that persist for 6 months or more. Nevertheless, patients with the disorder show improvement such that one-third to one-half no longer qualify for the diagnosis after 1 year or more. Even though improved, such patients experience more illness worry, view their health as worse, and utilize more health care than nonhypochondriacal patients.

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a chronic mental disorder characterised by high recurrence. There are numerous manic or hypomanic episodes in the course of the disease. Making a correct diagnosis can be difficult as patients most often turn for help in the depression phase; they also tend to interpret the hypomania phase as a state of very good mood and increased creativity, not identifying it with the disease. A depressive episode in the course of BPAD is characterised by the frequent coexistence of psychotic symptoms, excessive sleepiness and increased appetite. The first episode of the disease most often occurs at a young age. Apart from the typical symptoms of the depressive syndrome, we often observe accompanying cognitive disorders, which represent a group of symptoms causing significant discomfort and suffering to the patient. They most often intensify with the development of the disease and the number of subsequent episodes. In particular, the effectiveness of attention processes, executive functions and memory is weakened. These deficits have a negative impact on the patients’ day-to-day functioning at school, in the workplace and in society, and severely impair it. The case report presented herein shows the difficulties in diagnosing severe cognitive disorders during a depressive episode in the course of BPAD and the difficulties in differentiating between them and dementia, as well as presents the effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",

After an 8-year follow-up there was recurrence of seizures in 26 patients. Predictors for a seizure free state off medication were: few documented seizures in lifetime, no gross neurological abnormalities, medication below therapeutic levels at time of discontinuance, and persistently normal EEGs before and after discontinuance. Successful withdrawal of medication may have resulted from early control of seizures or early treatment; lack of actual epileptic seizures but presence of \"pseudoseizures\"; isolated event seizures; or seizures that could have resulted from nonepileptic, self-limiting factors.",

Os sinais clinicos comuns que afetam os caes com ansiedade por separacao, sao a vocalizacao, eliminacao (fezes ou urina), comportamento destrutivo e agressivo. Estes problemas tem importância na veterinaria devido as queixas dos proprietarios relacionada a seus caes. Os tratamentos requerem do proprietario uma dedicacao e tempo, pois necessita de educacao do cliente, modificacao do comportamento do cao, terapia com farmacos ansioliticos, mudanca do ambiente ou ate a combinacao destes. Nem todos os disturbios comportamentais podem ser eliminados, porem o tratamento tem resultados satisfatorios e nenhum dos caes submetidos ao tratamento piorou. O diagnostico e estabelecido pela anamnese, relato dos proprietarios, filmagens, observacao do cao e exames laboratoriais, como um hemograma completo, urinalise e urocultura para descartar outros problemas que nao tenham relacao com a SAS. O prognostico e o sucesso do tratamento dependem muito do desempenho do proprietario em seguir as orientacoes do (a) Medico (a) Veterinario (a).

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

In recent studies prevalence is at least 17% in primary care. Somatoform complaints (e.g. headache with 38.7%) or non-specific common symptoms (e.g. feeling of inner restlessness with 41.3%) are much more widespread. Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict. In this case, a psychosomatic/psychotherapeutic approach in primary care or a specialized psychotherapy is indicated.",

      "title": "Drug-induced restless legs syndrome",
      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by complaints of a strong desire to move legs during periods of rest or inactivity, which is relieved by movement (most pronounced in the evening or at night). Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью. Имеется много сообщений о лекарственно-индуцированном СБН (ЛИСБН), который наиболее часто вызывают антипсихотические средства, антидепрессанты и противоэпилептические препараты. К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические. Лечение ЛИСБН предполагает прежде всего отмену лекарственного средства или, если она невозможна, снижение его дозы. Профилактика ЛИСБН основывается на соблюдении принципов рациональной фармакотерапии.",

      "abstract": "Une crise d’epilepsie resulte de la survenue soudaine d’une activite neuronale anormalement intense, rythmique et synchrone dans une region plus ou moins etendue du systeme nerveux central. Les consequences cliniques sont extremement variees, selon les zones cerebrales affectees et la duree des crises, allant de breves secousses musculaires tres focalisees a une perte de conscience complete, eventuellement associee a des convulsions. Dans le cas de l’epilepsie-absence, une epilepsie generalisee d’origine genetique survenant frequemment chez les enfants, les crises s’expriment essentiellement par une suspension des processus conscients dans toutes leurs dimensions, y compris une interruption des perceptions conscientes. Ces symptomes sont correles a des decharges de pointes-ondes (DPO) dans les electroencephalogrammes (EEG) bilateraux. Les mecanismes physiopathologiques des alterations de conscience au cours des crises d’epilepsie-absence restent l’objet de debats intenses, opposant des alterations fonctionnelles a grande echelle a un filtrage des informations exogenes par les oscillations epileptiques. Au cours de mes recherches, j’ai explore l’hypothese alternative, mais non exclusive, d’un dysfonctionnement dynamique dans les processus d’integration sensorielle au sein des circuits thalamo-corticaux primaires. Des explorations electrophysiologiques fines n’etant pas realisables chez les enfants epileptiques, j’ai utilise un modele genetique presentant une forte homologie avec la pathologie humaine : le Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). En combinant in vivo des enregistrements electrocorticographiques (ECoG) et intracellulaires dans le cortex somatosensoriel primaire (S1), precedemment identifie comme le site de declenchement des crises, j’ai d’abord analyse les proprietes integratives et d’excitabilite des neurones pyramidaux du cortex S1, durant et en dehors des crises, et je les ai comparees a celles des neurones homologues chez des rats non epileptiques. J’ai montre que ces neurones presentent lors des periodes inter-ictales une excitabilite accrue, s‘exprimant par une augmentation de la decharge des neurones en reponse a des stimulations excitatrices d’intensite croissante ainsi qu’une tendance exacerbee a se re-polariser suite a une hyperpolarisation de grande amplitude, suggerant un accroissement du courant cationique h. Au cours des crises, les memes neurones montraient des changements differentiels dans leur excitabilite membranaire selon la composante pointe ou onde dans l‘ECoG correspondant. La pointe etait associee a une augmentation de decharge evoquee par un courant depolarisant et a une diminution de resistance membranaire. Symetriquement, l’onde etait correlee avec une augmentation de resistance membranaire et une diminution d’excitabilite. Ces changements dynamiques des proprietes integratives neuronales suggerent une instabilite des reponses corticales lors du cycle pointe-onde pouvant « brouiller » les signaux sensoriels lors des crises. J’ai teste cette hypothese en analysant les reponses des neurones corticaux, et des neurones thalamo-corticaux correspondants, a des stimulations appliquees sur les vibrisses controlaterales. Bien que les reponses synaptiques induites dans les neurones du cortex S1 par les stimulations sensorielles n’etaient pas globalement alterees lors des crises, elles etaient plus amples et plus efficaces pour declencher des potentiels d’action pendant l’onde compare a la composante pointe. Cet accroissement relatif de la reponse neuronale lors de l’onde ECoG resulte probablement de l’accroissement de resistance membranaire precedemment decrit, d’une augmentation de la force electromotrice des courants synaptiques glutamatergiques et de la forte probabilite de decharge des neurones thalamiques correspondants lors de cette composante.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular Risk in Tunisian Patients with Bipolar I Disorder",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (previously also labeled manic-depressive illness) is typically referred to as an episodic, yet lifelong and clinically severe affective (or mood) disorder, affecting approximately 3.5% of the population (Marmol, 2008;Simon, 2003;Wittchen et al., 2003;Woods, 2000).The term bipolar disorder, however, encompasses several phenotypes of mood disorders, i.e. mania, hypomania or cyclothymia that may present with a puzzling variety of other symptoms and disorders.According to the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 2004), the diagnostic classificatory system used in most epidemiological studies, bipolar disorder is defined by a set of specific symptom criteria.Bipolar type I requires the presence or the history of at least one manic or mixed episode.Although, typically, patients with a manic episode also experience major depressive episodes, bipolar disorder can be diagnosed even if only one manic episode and no past major depressive episodes are present.Bipolar disorder type II differs from type I only by presence of hypomanic but no manic episodes.Hypomanic episodes differ from mania by a shorter duration (at least 4 days instead of 1 week), and less severe impairment (not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, psychiatric hospitalization, or psychotic features).The DSM-IV also includes \"cyclothymia\" as a bipolar spectrum disorder with hypomanic as well as depressive episodes that do not meet criteria for major depression (American Psychiatric Association, 2004).Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease that is associated with a potentially devastating impact on patients' wellbeing and social, occupational, and general functioning (Revicki et al., 2005).The disorder ranks as the sixth leading cause of disability in the world, with an economic burden that in the US alone that was estimated more than a decade ago at $7 billion in direct medical costs and $38 billion (1991 values) in indirect costs (Wyatt et al., 1991).A number of reviews and studies have shown that people with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder, have an excess mortality, being two or three times as high as that www.intechopen.comDyslipidemia -From Prevention to Treatment 322 in the general population.This mortality gap, which translates to a 13-30 year shortened life expectancy in severe mental illness patients, has widened in recent decades, even in countries where the quality of the health care system is generally acknowledged to be good.About 60% of this excess mortality is due to physical illness especially cardiovascular disease.Additionally, several studies have found that after suicide and accidents, cardiovascular and all vascular diseases are the main leading causes of death in these patients (De Hert et al., 2011;Garcia-Portilla et al., 2009).Patients with bipolar disorder, especially type I, are known to suffer a considerable number of associated pathologies that may manifest at earlier ages and with higher frequency than in the general population.The most recent studies have explored cardiovascular risk and the association with metabolic and endocrine disorders fundamentally, obesity and metabolic syndrome which are clearly associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (Angst et al., 2002;Sicras et al., 2008).Cardiovascular disease, i.e. coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are potentially preventable diseases.Thanks to epidemiological, experimental and clinical studies, the primary determinants of cardiovascular disease have been identified, as well as the efficacy of specific interventions.The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is increasing in less urbanized, developed populations across the world, as their lifestyles change to a so called \"western style\", with increasing consumption of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol and salt, cigarette smoking, decreased physical activity and the rise in cardiovascular risk factors including obesity and diabetes.Other known factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk are stress and high alcohol intake.Among all these factors, hypercholesterolemia is the leading cause of death from cardiovascular disease.As a result, public health agencies have attempted to reduce the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia through screening and by increasing public awareness and strategies for reducing it (Muntoni et al., 2009).The exact mechanisms increasing the incidence of cardiovascular risk in bipolar patients remain to be clarified, but they possibly include industrialisation, stress, lack of exercise, dietary lipids (that is, omega-3 fatty acid deficiency) and increasing incidence of smoking and alcohol consumption and other factors (Ezzaher et al., 2010).This study aims to investigate the principal factors predisposing to the cardiovascular risk in Tunisian bipolar I patients (cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lipid profile, hyperhomocysteinemia and metabolic syndrome) and to determine the association between these factors and the clinical and therapeutic characteristics of bipolar I disorder. Patients and methods SubjectsThis study was approved by the local ethical committee and all subjects were of Tunisian origin.Our samples included 130 patients with bipolar I disorder (37.9 ± 12.1 years) from the psychiatry department of the University Hospital of Monastir, Tunisia, 45 women (37.5 ± 13.4 years) and 85 men (38.1 ± 11.4 years).Consensus on the diagnosis, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2004), was made by psychiatrists.The exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, other psychiatric illnesses, epilepsy or mental retardation.The control group consisted of 175 volunteer subjects without psychiatric pathology.The mean age was 40.1 ± 14.0 years, and there were 73 women (42.0 ± 14.4 years) and 102 men (38.8 ± 13.6 www.intechopen.com* Lipid profile parameters, folatemia, vitamin B12 and uric acid were adjusted for gender, BMI, cigarette smoking, alcoholic beverages, diabetes and hypertension *Hcys was adjusted for gender, BMI, cigarette smoking, alcoholic beverages, diabetes, hypertension, folatemia and vitamin B12",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Adolescents with psychoses usually have full recovery from their first psychotic episode, but the first relapse often arises within 2 years of the first episode. Cannabis-related psychoses are difficult to distinguish from schizophrenic psychoses. Here, we describe a particularly severe clinical case, with a first psychotic episode occurring after heavy cannabis smoking, an atypically long symptom-free duration, and a subsequent non-substance-related episode.A 17-year-old male adolescent of Middle-East origin presented with delusions and hallucinations after extensive cannabis smoking. His first psychotic episode, with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, progressed into severe catatonic symptoms. His symptoms were treated with electroconvulsive therapy and risperidone and he was transferred to a residential substance abuse treatment center. He remained drug-free and non-psychotic for 3.5 years. Given the temporal association with extensive cannabis use, and his full remission of symptoms lasting several years, a cannabis-induced psychosis-though atypically extended-could be suspected. However, after 3.5 years without psychiatric care, and in a drug-free state, our patient again presented with positive psychotic symptoms, possibly induced by a period of severe psychosocial stress.We here discuss whether a primary schizophrenic episode possibly induced by cannabis can increase the risk of subsequent non-drug-related schizophrenic episodes.",

PD jest chorobą postępującą, w której dochodzi do utraty neuronów dopaminowych istoty czarnej (SN) a cechą patologiczną jest obecność ciał Lewy'ego, złożonych m.in. z białka ?-synukleiny. Gdy utrata neuronów w SN przekroczy ok. 60% wówczas pojawiają się główne objawy kliniczne (ruchowe), czyli bradykinezja, sztywność mięśniowa, drżenie spoczynkowe i zaburzenia postawy, chodu. PD jest chorobą o złożonej etiopatogenezie, w której bardzo ważny jest okres przedkliniczny/prodromalny, bowiem pojawiają się wówczas objawy pozaruchowe, np. osłabienie węchu, depresja czy zaburzenia snu, wyprzedzające nawet o kilkanaście lat fazę kliniczną. Niniejsza praca, poza opisem podstawowych informacji na temat PD, skupia się na zaburzeniach snu, wśród których najważniejszym jest zaburzenie zachowania w czasie snu REM, które może stanowić wczesny marker diagnostyczny rozwijającej się choroby, a tym samym pomóc w poszukiwaniu nowych terapii neuroprotekcyjnych już na wczesnym, prodromalnym etapie.",

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be viewed as a defect in organization resulting from varying combinations of genetic, organic, intrafamilial and social influences. A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

These are seizures that occur in close temporal relationship to a documented brain insult or at the time of an acute systemic insult. Epilepsy is a tendency toward unprovoked recurrent seizures and is the most common reason for seizure occurrences in the hospital. Most seizures that occur in adulthood are focal seizures that arise from disrupted lobar or hemispheric function.

In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

The individual must be ill for at least 6 months and need not be psychotically active during that time. Schizophrenia is classified into several types. Enforcement of the type of diagnosis of schizophrenia can be established through history taking in the patient and family, then a diagnosis is made according to ICD-10. Treatment can be in the form of pharmacological or psychosocial therapy.&#x0D; Case Reports: A 32-year-old male patient came with his family, the patient looked anxious. The patient comes with the main complaint that he is often angry because he often hears voice whispers. The patient also complains of rapid mood changes. According to the family, this has been happening since 2015. He had been on treatment for a while but only got better shortly after that it came back again.&#x0D; Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder in which the patient does not have contact with reality which is characterized by major disturbances in thoughts and emotions and experiences delusions and hallucinations. Schizophrenia can be treated using antipsychotics and psychosocial. The prognosis of patients with schizophrenia depends on family support.",

La hipertension arterial es asintomatica, razon por la cual el paciente desconoce la severidad de la misma, constituyendose en un factor de riesgo para la salud. Esta enfermedad cardiovascular esta asociada a diversos factores psicologicos, como el estres, la ansiedad, depresion, hostilidad, ira y bajos niveles de apoyo social. Para el tratamiento de esta patologia, se requiere un proceso de implicacion activa por parte del paciente denominado adherencia terapeutica, que le permite al diagnosticado seguir las recomendaciones y adquirir habitos beneficiosos; la falta de adherencia es una de las principales causas del bajo control de la presion arterial. Existen factores que interfieren en este proceso como son: a. los derivados del paciente (psicologicos): ansiedad, estres, trastornos del estado de animo y rasgos de personalidad tipo a, b. los del entorno socio-economico y cultural (apoyo inadecuado), c. los de la enfermedad (asintomatologia y cronicidad) y d. los del tratamiento farmacologico, servicios de salud y personal que atiende al paciente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo tiene como objetivo, establecer la relacion entre los factores psicosociales y las estrategias de afrontamiento empleadas por los pacientes con enfermedad oncologica.

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis in epilepsy may occur in different forms, ranging from brief episodes with a clear temporal relationship to seizures (ictal or postictal psychosis) to symptoms or signs apparently independent of seizures, often manifesting decades after the onset of epilepsy (interictal psychosis). In some patients postictal psychosis develops into interictal psychosis over time. Psychosis may also be observed after epilepsy surgery despite excellent seizure control. The features of psychosis in epilepsy closely resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The prevalence of psychosis is higher in patients with epilepsy compared to the general population; it is less clear whether the prevalence of epilepsy is increased in patients with schizophrenia. Subtle structural brain anomalies have been found in both disorders, and it remains uncertain by what mechanisms schizophrenia and psychosis of epilepsy are related. In terms of treatment, the control of underlying seizure activity is most important in ictal psychosis, for instance psychosis occurring in the context of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Postictal psychosis is usually brief and self-limiting. Treatment is therefore rarely problematic. Short-acting benzodiazepines and neuroleptic drugs are recommended. The treatment of more prolonged interictal psychoses can be challenging and there are no universally accepted neuroleptic treatment regimes.",

Laporan kasus: Perempuan 45 tahun merupakan pasien skizofrenia paranoid (F20.02). Selama sebulan terakhir, pasien juga sering merasa lelah dan tidak bersemangat. Ia berpikir tinggal menunggu waktu saja untuk bisa menyusul kedua orang tuanya yang sudah meninggal dunia. Pasien tidak memiliki niatan bunuh diri dan tidak pernah melakukan percobaan bunuh diri. Terdapat dua diagnosis banding pada pasien ini, yaitu skizoafektif tipe depresif (F25.1) dan episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik (F32.3).Diskusi: Topik pembicaraan pada gangguan afek pasien ini selalu berkaitan dengan suasana berkabung, yaitu kematian kedua orang tuanya. Respon terhadap kehilangan yang bermakna, misalnya berkabung, sangat mungkin menyerupai episode depresif.Kesimpulan: Suasana berkabung dapat dibedakan dengan episode depresi dengan melihat beberapa karakteristik gejalanya.

      "title": "Cyclothymic temperament and/or borderline personality disorder",
      "abstract": "Many patients within the Bipolar spectrum, especially when recurrence is high and the inter-episodic period is not free of affective manifestations, may meet criteria for personality disorders. This is particularly true for cyclothymic patients, who are often misclassified as borderline personality disorder because of their extreme mood instability and reactivity. In patients with cyclothymic temperament, lifetime comorbidity with anxiety disorders, in particular panic disorder-agoraphobia, bulimia nervosa, body dysmorphic disorder, alcohol and substance abuse disorder and both cluster C (anxious) and cluster B (dramatic) personality disorders, is the rule rather than the exception [1]. In particular, a large proportion of these patients meet DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorders. Cyclothymic-bipolar II-borderline patients display a long-lasting hyper-reactivity to many psychological (i.e, rejection, separation) and physical (i.e., food, light, drugs) stimuli. This marked reactivity of mood could also explain the frequent concomitance of impulse control disorder and substances and alcohol abuse. An analysis of the explanatory power of affective temperaments and personality disorders for each of the criteria of BPD (Perugi et al., in press) revealed that the presence of cyclothymic temperament explains much of the relationship between bipolar II disorder and BPD. The diagnosis of BPD in these patients was favored by the coexistence of an affective cyclothymic temperamental dysregulation coexisting with anxious-dependent traits. We find no reason to separate bipolar II with cyclothymic instability from the stable instability of the borderline type, because mood lability is a common characteristic of both sets of disorders. Further, correlational analyses [2] indicate that in bipolar II atypical depressives mood reactivity and interpersonal sensitivity traits might be related constructs with a cyclothymic temperamental matrix.",

      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinations of the senses in the insane resemble the voluntarily induced semi-consciousness of the mesmerised. In the mesmeric trance there is the disregard of external agencies that is seen in the maniac who, regardless of suggestions from without, carries out his own wild train of thought in apparent unconsciousness of what is going on around him, or even memory of what has occurred to him, after the trance or the paroxysm has passed away—and so in sleep, dreams prove an active state of the cerebral centres, although no recollection of them may remain on awaking. Sleep has been likened to temporary death, and so dreaming may be compared to temporary insanity. The insane man walks about in a waking dream; he is a veritable somnambulist. The somnambulist, like the maniac, or the ecstatic, has but a confused recollection, or no remembrance at all of what has occurred in the attack of mental disorder, or in their perilous sleeping performances, like Fakirs in their trance-like condition, they become insensible to external influences.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

The interview should ensure that the child's elevated mood or irritability is not accounted for by other disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or substance use disorder. If the parent endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child's symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the DSM-5 required duration. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

The concept of health and disease varies with the sociocultural context. It is important to know the cultural characteristics to exercise good clinical practice. The stigma surrounding mental illness is widely known, and is even stronger in the Roma community, leading to marginalization and shame. Objectives We present a case of a gypsy woman misdiagnosed from the age of 8 with hebephrenic schizophrenia. Methods Patient frequents the emergency department with symptoms of predominantly anxiety, including episodes of psychomotor agitation, self-harm, verbalization of visual hallucinations of a mystical-religious nature. In treatment with antipsychotics since diagnosis, with no therapeutic adherence. It is observed during all the episodes how the anxiolytic treatment, even, sometimes, the verbal restraint, make the symptoms subside. Psychotic symptoms over the years are ruled out. Results Due to the diagnosis, this patient has been relegated from the gypsy community, she has not married or had children (an important milestone in gypsy culture), this has generated an exponential increase in anxiety symptoms and home problems. Conclusions It is important to know the cultural traits to which the patients we treat in consultation belong, and how the disease can affect their lives, and a simple diagnosis can be a source of greater anxiety.

      "abstract": "Psychological distress is a driver both of direct and indirect health care costs. Depression compromises functional well-being, such as work productivity. Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a condition in which multiple epileptic seizures occur without complete recovery from the physiological effects of one seizure before another seizure occurs. There are as many types of SE as there are kinds of epileptic seizures. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus initially presents with repeated generalized convulsions without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. If untreated or undertreated, the convulsive activity becomes progressively subtle and is accompanied by a predictable series of progressive EEG changes. Non-convulsive SE refers to complex partial SE or absence SE, both of which exhibit an epileptic twilight state of altered contact with the environment. In simple partial SE there is no impairment of consciousness, and the behavioural changes reflect focal ictal discharges confined to one area of the cortex. There are between 65,000 and 150,000 cases of the SE in the US each year. Both acute and remote cerebral insults can cause SE, as can severe systemic disease that causes SE secondary to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Mortality is high, but is largely a reflection of underlying aetiology when SE is treated appropriately and aggressively. Treatment is focused on terminating ongoing seizure activity as quickly as possible, both because the longer SE persists the more likely permanent neuronal damage will ensure and also because of strong evidence that the longer SE persists the more refractory to treatment it will be. Currently the most commonly accepted treatment protocol involves rapid initiation of therapy with intravenous lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg), followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenytoin, followed, if necessary, by 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital. However, some neurologists still use intravenous diazepam (because of its more rapid antistatus effect) followed by phenytoin. New experimental data in the rat suggest that phenytoin followed by diazepam may be more effective, but this order of administration still has to tested in properly designed clinical trials.",

      "title": "Has the Drug of Choice for Treating Critical Illness Delirium Been Established?",
      "abstract": "Critical illness delirium (hereafter simplified to \"delirium\") is an acute confusional state seen in up to 80% of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness, changes in cognition, perceptual disturbances, a fluctuating course, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, disorientation, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and hallucinations or delusions. 1As a constellation of symptoms and signs that commonly occur together, delirium should not be considered in and of itself a disease, but rather should be thought of as a syndrome, 2 specifically one of acute brain dysfunction that can typically be traced back to one or more inciting causes.The mainstay of therapy, therefore, must aim to address the underlying causes of the syndrome and not simply treat the symptoms.Just as for a patient presenting with new-onset congestive heart failure it would be inappropriate to treat the symptoms by administering furosemide and oxygen without looking for and treating the underlying cause (e.g., an acute coronary syndrome), the drug of choice for delirium cannot simply be the one that best treats the symptoms; rather, it must address the underlying cause.Therefore, the drug of choice to treat any given case of delirium will be patient-and cause-specific.It could be the antibiotic that targets the patient's infection, the free water that addresses the patient's hypernatremia, the laxatives that resolve the patient's constipation, the benzodiazepine that counters the patient's alcohol withdrawal, or the correct treatment that addresses any of the myriad other causes of delirium.The number of potential drivers of delirium is immense, and the reader is encouraged to consult other sources for further information on their assessment and treatment. 1,3,4 Of course, although it is essential to address the underlying etiology of delirium, its symptoms cannot be ignored, as they have the potential to cause significant harm to both the patient and the patient's care team.Anyone who has worked in an ICU for any period of time will have seen a patient with delirium self-extubate or pull out a Foley catheter with the balloon up!Such adverse events can result in significant morbidity and potentially even death. 5 Additionally, patients experiencing delirium can pose a danger to the care team if they become aggressive to the point of striking and injuring care providers.What may be less obvious is that these agitated patients are also at increased risk of morbidity",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies are conditions that mostly destabilize the already frenetic activity of the Emergency Department. Sometimes the emergency is clearly referable to primitive psychiatric illness. Other times, psychiatric and organic symptoms can independently coexist (comorbidity), or develop together in different conditions of substance abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs. Differentiating between substance induced and pre-existing psychiatric disorder (dual diagnosis) may be difficult, other than controversial issue. Finally, an organic disease can hide behind a psychiatric disorder (pseudopsychiatric emergency). In this review (part I), psychiatric disorders that occur with organic symptoms are discussed. They include: (1) anxiety, conversion and psychosomatic disorders, and (2) simulated diseases. The physiologic mechanisms of the stress reaction, divided into a dual neuro-hormonal response, are reviewed in this section: (1) activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla with catecholamine production (rapid response), and (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cortisol production (slow response). The concept of the fight-or-flight response, its adaptive significance and the potential evolution in paralyzing response, well showing by Yerkes-Dodson curve, is explained. Abnormal short- and long-term reactions to stress evolving toward well codified cluster of trauma and stressor-related disorders, including acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are examined. A brief review of major psychiatric disorder and related behaviour abnormalities, vegetative symptoms and cognitive impairment, according to DMS IV-TR classification, are described. Finally, the reactive psychic symptoms and behavioral responses to acute or chronic organic disease, so called \"somatopsychic disorders\", commonly occurring in elderly and pediatric patients, are presented. The specific conditions of post-operative and intensive care unit patients, and cancer and HIV positive population are emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Early myoclonic epilepsy (EME) and Ohtahara syndrome (OS) or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) are the earliest epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. These two entities share many features, including age at presentation, a similar electroencephalographic pattern, intractable seizures, and poor prognosis. EME and EIEE are traditionally distinguished according to different type of seizures, differences in the pattern of suppression-burst, and aetiologies. In EIEE onset is within the first 3 months of age and often within the first 2 weeks. Infants acutely develop tonic spasms that can be either generalized or lateralized, can occur both isolated or in clusters, and are independent from the sleep cycle. The most specific EEG feature is the suppression-burst (SB). This pattern is characterized by high-voltage bursts alternating with almost flat suppression phases at an approximately regular rate. SB pattern differs definitely from the periodic type of hypsarrhythmia where it becomes remarkable in sleep. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) can be associated with structural, metabolic, and genetic abnormalities: methylmalonic acidemia, sulphite oxidase deficiency, Menkes disease, and Zellweger syndrome, and CDG disorders. Other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies due to specific genetic aetiology include CDKL5-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 300672), KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 613720), SCN2A-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 613721), and SCN8A-related epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 614558).",

      "abstract": "Se presenta el caso de un varón de 92 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular bilateral, hipoacusia moderada, trastorno del sueño y enfermedad cardiovascular (HTA, BAV de primer y segundo grado), sin deterioro cognitivo significativo (MEC 28/35). Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.",

      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) recur during the premenstrual phase of the cycle and disappear to the beginning or after last menstruation. The main symptoms are emotional liability, dysphoria and anxiety. Objectives To review PMDD for helping in the differential diagnosis between this disease and classical anxiety disorders. Methods It was made a clinical review about differential diagnosis and comorbilities on PMDD in specialized literature and Pub-Med. Results PMDD causes significant distress and impairment in social or occupational functioning the first week following menstruation. In relation with differential diagnosis on PMDD, on the one hand, several organic diseases could produce the same symptoms than PMDD: for example gynecological pathology as dysmenorrhea or menopausal transition, endocrinological diseases as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and some hormonal treatment including hormonal contraceptives. In addition, a variety of medical disorders are concomitant pathologies that could be associated with PMDD (eg, migraine; epilepsy, asthma, allergies, systemic exertion intolerance disease, chronic fatigue syndrome; irritable bowel syndrome). These pathologies are exacerbated just before or during menstruation. On the other hand, several psychiatric disorders as bipolar disorder, major depression, dystimia, and anxiety disorders could get worse on the premenstrual phase. Conclusions In relation with the diagnosis of PMDD, it seems necessary to consider various differential diagnosis such as psychiatric, gynecological and endocrine disorders because of all of them share like symptoms. For this purpose it is very important to make both a good clinical history and a comprehensive physical examination to offer the most accurate diagnosis and treatment.

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

      "title": "Depression in psychosis: where does it come from?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Many patients suffering from schizophrenia have symptoms suggesting depression during the course of their illness. It can appear both in the prodrome of a psychotic decompensation and in the acute phase, as well as after its resolution. But is it part of the disease itself? Is it an experiential reaction to the assumption of the sickness or is it an independent entity? Can it be produced or exacerbated by antipsychotics? Objectives This case study aims to analyze the clinical presentation of depressive symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia. Methods A review of the literature on affective symptomatology which may occur in psychosis. Results A 34-year-old male with a history in Mental Health since the age of 16, with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. He has presented at least 5 depressive episodes and several severe self-harming attempts. He is on treatment with olanzapine, clonazepam, quetiapine and aripiprazole. During a follow-up, he reports intensification of low mood in the last few weeks due to sentimental break-up, clinophilia and social isolation. He spends the day in his room with the curtains lowered, he has neglected his personal hygiene, and verbalizes thoughts of death. He shows poor functioning, slowed thinking and lack of energy. His mother reports that he has had self-aggressive behaviors, such as hitting his face and eating his faeces. Sensory and perceptual disturbances are not excluded. Given the current depressive affective state and risk of commiting suicide, it is decided to admit him to the hospital and to start treatment with fluoxetine. A few weeks after hospital discharge, he continues with poor functioning and isolation, but his mood is better and his thoughts of death have disappeared. Conclusions Although clear differentiation between depressive and psychotic symptomatology has been classically described, both symptoms are often associated. Affective symptoms can be part of different stages of the disease, secondary to medication, due to insight phenomena or part of schizoaffective disorder and psychotic depressions. Depressive symptomatology can also be confused with the presentation of negative symptoms. They both share clinical manifestations such as anergy, social isolation and lack of interest; but while in depression there is a sad mood, in negative symptons there is emotional flattering. Also, positive symptomatology can simulate social withdrawal, usually seen in depression. Depression in an acute phase has historically been related to a better prognosis, although several studies indicate that depression in a chronic phase causes a higher risk of suicide and relapses. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. In our case, the patient suffers from major affective symptoms regarding his life situation, which may be overlapped by isolation due to a likely positive symptomatology, without dismissing possible negative symptomatology as a result of many years of evolution of his disease.

      "title": "Introduction: Emotion and Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the complexity and exquisite regulation of emotion described in previous chapters, it is not surprising that emotional dysfunction lies at the core of a variety of psychopathological conditions. The syndromes of emotional dysregulation lie on a continuum of temporal characteristics, ranging from seconds/minutes (panic attacks) to hours/days (borderline personality disorder) to weeks/ months (unipolar and bipolar illness) to years/lifetime (schizophrenia and autism). The panic/anxiety disorders are characterized by paroxysmal episodes of panic, sometimes superimposed on more chronic components of dysphoria, agoraphobia, and depression. The marked mood lability of borderline personality disorder and its interdigitation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndromes are typified by extremely rapid and major mood shifts. Included in this phasic dysregulation are prominent components of anxiety, depression, proneness to substance abuse, and chaotic experience of the self and relationships to others. The unipolar and bipolar affective disorders range from chronic dysthymia to irregular bursts of recurrent brief depression to minor and major depression to these conditions in the context of hypomania (bipolar II) and fullblown mania (bipolar I). This range of depressive and manic mood disorders is common in the general population and most typical of psychopathologies involving dysfunction of emotional regulation. The schizophrenias are more commonly associated with a persistent disconnection of affect from its appropriate context, and thus they present with prominent autistic components. In childhood autism itself there is an early and chronic breakdown of emotional communication that often involves an absence of normal language and affective responsiveness to others. Given this range of type and temporal dissimilarities among the major psychopathological syndromes of emotion, we chose to highlight in this part several of the more prominent syndromes and components that bridge diagnostic categories Although each of the chapters has a separate focus, it is worth emphasizing the constant interaction and interplay of cognition, emotion, and neurobiology that is important not only for understanding the psychological and neurobiological substrates of affective dysregulation but also for approaches to therapeutics that can also involve each of three domains (affective, cognitive, and somatic) as primary targets.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a major public health problem, affecting \napproximately 1.3 ± 0.2 % of the Mexican population. In addition \nto the subjects personal suffering, bipolar disorders places \nsubstantial burdens on health care services, families, caregivers \nand employers. In the World Health Organization’s Global Burden \nof Disease study, bipolar disorder ranked sixth among all medical \ndisorders in years of life lost to death or disability. \nBipolar depression, or the depressive phase of bipolar disorder, \nrepresents a difficult- to- treat and disabling form of depression. \nHowever, in regard to its impact, an insufficient number of studies \nhave explored its treatment. Studies indicate that patients with \nbipolar disorder spend more time in treatment and take longer to \nrecover from the depressive phase that from the manic phase. \nPatients with bipolar disorder, experience depressive symptoms \nmore than 3 times more longer than they experience manic \nsymptoms. The median time to recovery from the depressive phase \nis 9 weeks but from the manic phase is 5 weeks; 22 % of the \npatients in the depressive phase and only 7 % in the manic phase \nremained ill for at least 1 year. The median time to full remission \nis 16.8 weeks for a manic episode but 40 weeks for a depressive \nepisode. In addition to being longer and more persistent, the \ndepressive phase of bipolar disorder is associated with higher \nrates of morbidity and mortality. The relative risk of suicide \namong patients with bipolar depression is 34.9 times greater than \nthat among patients with pure mania. Despite the clear clinical \nimplications of these findings, treatment of bipolar depression \nremains an understudied area, as clinicians and researchers have \nhistorically focused on treatment of mania. Although a wide \nrange of mood-stabilizing medications is available, treatment \noptions for bipolar depression remain more limited. The 2002 \ntreatment guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association \nrecommended either lithium or lamotrigine as first-line treatment. \nAlthough reviews of clinical trials have concluded that there is \nevidence of lithium’s acute efficacy for bipolar depression, \nanticonvulsants such as lamotrigine and valproate have also been \nused to treat bipolar depression. However, lamotrigine requires a \nslow upward titration to avoid the risk of rash. Other treatments \ninclude the adjunctive use of antidepressants with a mood \nstabilizer. However, antidepressants, may cause problems due to \ntheir potential to induce mania or hypomania or to accelerate \ncycling. \nThis paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, \noutlines criteria for choosing treatment, and provides options for \ntreatment of refractory bipolar depression. The author conducted \na comprehensive review of English-language literature describing \npeer- reviewed and quality class A controlled trials in order to \nidentify agents used for bipolar disorder. Controlled studies to \nexamine the efficacy of treatments for acute bipolar depression \nwere located through electronic searches of several databases and \nby manual cross search of references and proceedings of \ninternational meetings. Lithium: There are no double-blind, \nparallel-design, placebo-controlled studies that have examined \nthe efficacy of lithium monotherapy in comparison with placebo \nin acute bipolar depression. However, the efficacy of lithium was \nexamined in three placebo-controlled cross-over studies and all \nof them showed lithium’s superiority over placebo. Available \ndata supports the efficacy of lithium in acute bipolar depression. \nValproate: A recent placebo-controlled, parallel-design study, \nexamined the efficacy of valproate monotherapy. Intent-to-treat \nanalysis indicated that 43 % of the subjects randomized to \nvalproate and 27 % randomized to placebo met criteria for \nrecovery (p= .04), but mean change from baseline in HAM-D \nscores were similar at the end-point to the placebo group. The \nnegative findings in this study could be due to a smaller sample \nsize, so this suggests the efficacy of valproate in acute bipolar \ndepression but this needs to be verified in further larger- scale \ndouble- blind trials. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine has some \nefficacy, but further studies are needed before firm conclusions \ncan be drown. Lamotrigine: In the largest double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel study of bipolar depression to date, the \nlamotrigine 200 mg/day group showed a significantly greater \nimprovement compared with the placebo group on the \nMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the \nClinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. In another \n10-weekdouble-blind trial in bipolar I and bipolar II depressed \npatients, above all, no significant differences were noted using \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). However, a subgroup \nanalysis revealed significant differences favoring lamotrigine in \nbipolar I but not in bipolar II depressed patients. The efficacy of \nlamotrigine in preventing depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder \nwas examined in two recent double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudies. In one of the studies, patients with bipolar I disorder \nwho were currently or recently in a manic or hypomanic phase \nwere treated with lamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy to \nother psychotropic medications. Survival analysis showed that \nlamotrigine was significantly superior to placebo in time, for any \nmood episode or depressive episode. In the other study, bipolar I \ndepressed patients were treated in an open-label design with \nlamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy and those meeting \nthe stabilization criteria were randomized to double-blind \ntreatment with one of three fixed doses of lamotrigine \nmonotherapy, lithium monotherapy or placebo for 18 months. \nResults using survival analysis indicated that lamotrigine was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in delaying time of intervention \nfor any mood episode or a depressive episode. The results of these \ntwo double-blind trials clearly indicate that lamotrigine is effective \nin delaying depressive relapses and recurrences in bipolar I patients. \nThere is no evidence to indicate that lamotrigine induces rapid \ncycling in bipolar patients. Gabapentine: The efficacy of gabapentine \nmonotherapy in comparison with lamotrigine or placebo was \nexamined over a 6-week period in patients with refractory mood \ndisorders. The results of this study indicate that lamotrigine is \neffective in 45 % of the patients, and gabapentine is no more \neffective than placebo in treating depressive symptoms. Topiramate: \nNo double-blind studies have been reported on the efficacy of \ntopiramate monotherapy in bipolar depression. Antidepressants: In \ndouble-blind active comparator studies, response rates to \nimipramina were comparable with the response rates to fluoxetine \nthrough significantly lower when compared with tranylcypromine. \nAtypical antipsychotics: Olanzapine is the only atypical antipsychotic \nthat has been tested for its efficacy in a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in bipolar depression. Response rates were 48.2 % \nin the olanzapine group, 64.8 % in the olanzapine plus fluoxetine \ngroup, and 36.1 % in the placebo group. The results of this study \nindicate olanzapine’s monotherapy efficacy in treating acute bipolar \ndepression. \nConclusions: The literature reviewed above indicates that lithium \nis the only efficient medication in acute bipolar depression and in \npreventing depressive episodes, and that it has no propensity to \ninduce a manic switch or rapid cycling; also, it should be the firstline treatment for bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is also efficient \nin acute bipolar depression, and in preventing depressive episodes, \nbut its efficacy in preventing manic episodes has not been proven. \nThe magnitude of the antidepressant effect of olanzapine appears \nto be somewhat smaller than other established antidepressant \nmedications as well as lamotrigine. The other anticonvulsants, \nantidepressants, or atypical antipsychotics cannot be recommended \nas first-line treatments for bipolar depression.",

The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common.

In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease.

They usually go beyond the usual pathological psychoreactions in terms of quality, intensity and duration. Emotion psychoses show schizophrenia-like symptoms; the duration of illness varies from a few hours to several weeks. Emotion psychoses are observed in other cultural groups, too.

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus(SE)is defined as a prolonged seizure and is a common neurological emergency with high morbidity and mortality rates. As uncontrolled SE causes irreversible neurological damage, prompt diagnosis and treatment are required. If anti-seizure medications and benzodiazepines, which are initial treatments for SE, are not effective and SE deteriorates to refractory, anesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity under electroencephalogram(EEG)monitoring. Continuous EEG monitoring is useful not only for evaluating the control of SE but also for diagnosing non-convulsive SE(NCSE)and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. New-onset refractory status epilepticus is defined as refractory SE in a patient without active epilepsy and without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause. Because autoimmune encephalitis is the most frequently identified cause, immunotherapy can be attempted in addition to antiepileptic treatment within 2 weeks. Although NCSE is the major cause of unconsciousness, diagnosis is difficult because of uncertain clinical symptoms. Continuous EEG monitoring over 24 h is crucial for diagnosis, although arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging is alternatively useful. Finally, the building of a multidisciplinary cooperation system is required for prompt diagnosis and intensive treatment for controlling SE.",

      "abstract": "Sir: When depression is preceded by a history of manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode, classifying it as bipolar depression rather than unipolar depression becomes straightforward. However, when there is no access to such history and the initial presentation is from the depressive end of the pole, correctly classifying the disorder as bipolar rather than unipolar then becomes difficult. Being able to correctly classify depression as bipolar rather than unipolar is crucial due to the ramifications of the diagnosis in terms of management. For example, it has been recommended that the depressive period of uncomplicated bipolar disorder should be treated for shorter periods than that for unipolar depression.1 Whereas in unipolar depression antidepressant monotherapy may be appropriate, in bipolar depression, without coupling it with a mood stabilizer, it may precipitate a “manic switch” and create a state of chronic irritable dysphoria and possibly a long-term rapid-cycling course.\r\n\r\nDue to symptomatic similarity between the 2 diagnostic entities, no particular symptom invariably distinguishes between the 2 disorders. However, if residents, psychiatrists, and family physicians can maintain a high index of suspicion, then certain factors from the past or present history would indicate that the depressive episode is more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar. We describe the mnemonic “Bipolar Family” to remind clinicians of factors or symptom clusters that would make a depressive episode more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n“Bipolar Family”: Factors That Make a Depressive Episode More Likely To Be Bipolar Rather Than Unipolara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant difference in treatment3 and despite the similarity in presentation, we hope that residents, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians will utilize this mnemonic as a screening tool when faced with a patient who primarily presents with a depressive episode.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN La aparición de síntomas psicóticos es una de las complicaciones más frecuentes producidas por el consumo agudo o crónico de cocaína, apareciendo hasta en el 65-70% de los consumidores. El síndrome de Ekbom se ha relacionado con múltiples causas, entre ellas el consumo de estimulantes y con la abstinencia al alcohol. El paciente tiene la convicción delirante monotemática de estar infectado por parásitos, lo cual puede acompañarse de otras manifestaciones como alteraciones sensoperceptivas. OBJETIVOS Analizar el papel de la cocaína en la aparición del síndrome de Ekbom. MATERIAL Y MÉTODO Descripción de un caso clínico y su revisión bibliográfica. Varón de 56 años, sin antecedentes en Salud Mental. Ex consumidor de cannabis y cocaína. Como antecedentes somáticos presenta infección por VHC curada y VIH. Recae en el consumo de cocaína tras fallecimiento de un familiar en Enero 2022, siendo derivado a la Unidad de Hospitalización en Junio 2022 por convicción delirante paranoide y actividad alucinatoria. En la exploración psicopatológica el paciente presenta delirios de infestación y zoopsias. En la exploración física observamos escoriaciones y cicatrices que se corresponden con rascado. Sin embargo, en el examen clínico no se encuentran alteraciones que justifiquen estas lesiones. Al ingreso comienza con Olanzapina 10mg desapareciendo la sintomatología en un par de días. CONCLUSIONES Es necesario hacer un correcto diagnóstico diferencial, mediante un examen clínico exhaustivo, el cual, en este caso, no pone de manifiesto ninguna patología física que justifique el cuadro, a pesar de lo cual el paciente presenta absoluta convicción. La idea delirante se ha relacionado con el aumento de los niveles de dopamina en los ganglios basales por el bloqueo del transportador de dopamina que producen los psicoestimulantes como la cocaína. De esta forma, es imprescindible el cese del consumo de tóxicos y un correcto tratamiento con neurolépticos.",

      "abstract": "Summary: A 31–year‐old man had a unique form of occipital lobe epilepsy. Since age 13 years, he has had episodes of simple partial status epilepticus (SE) occurring twice a month. These typically consisted of elementary visual hallucinations of flashing lights obscuring his left visual field for a period of 2 days, associated with a severe frontal headache initially diagnosed as migraine. These episoaes of simple partial SE then evolved to a complex partial seizure (CPS) or secondarily eneralized seizure. There were unique EEG features, including: (a) the perception of a flash of light in the left visual field with a single sharpislow wave discharge over the right occipital lobe, (b) right occipital lobe epileptiform activity during the prolonged aura, and (c) an abnormal response to photic stimulation, with occipital lobe discharges during low rates of stimulation (3–5 Hz), time‐locked to the stimzlus. High‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with quantitative morphometry demonstrated that the right hemisphere and right caudate nucleus were smaller than those on the left. An abnormal gyral pattern was also noted over the right parietal region. Occasionally, distinguishing occipital lobe epilepsy from migraine may be difficult.",

      "title": "Apathy in schizophrenia: assessment in clinical settings and overlap with other dimensions of impairment",
      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

However, the most common symptom of schizophrenia is disability in everyday functioning: impairments in social, living, and vocational outcomes. The striking clinical signs of schizophrenia are episodic in nature and can come and go even in the absence of treatment, as demonstrated by the fact that up to a third of people with schizophrenia demonstrated remission of these symptoms even prior to the development of antipsychotic medications. In contrast, disability in schizophrenia develops early in the illness and is persistent, even during periods when the symptoms just described are absent because of treatment or spontaneous remission.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

      "title": "Clinical and psychopathological analysis of emotional and cognitive disorders in patients with type II diabetes",
      "abstract": "The psycho-emotional state has the most significant effect on the clinical picture and course of diabetes of any type. According to many researchers, it is known that patients with diabetes suffer from depression almost three times more often than patients without it. When the patient has symptoms of depression, his emotional state is disturbed, which quite often leads to the patient's refusal of the prescribed necessary treatment, and eventually decompensation of the somatic state occurs. In turn, it causes new episodes of depression, which requires the use of psychotropic drugs and psychotherapy. A comprehensive clinical-psychopathological and psychodiagnostic examination of 82 patients with type II diabetes of moderate and severe forms was conducted. The average duration of diabetes was (7.9±5.2) years. Emotional disorders are represented by anxious, depressive, astheno-hypochondriac, hysteroform variants of psychopathological symptoms. Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication of type II diabetes. It is associated with both the age-related aspect of the disease and the pathological dysmetabolic cascade that forms basis of the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy development. Cognitive decline in type II diabetes has a mixed (vascular-degenerative) nature and is characterized by complaints of decreased working capacity, and is marked by a decrease in memory, auditory-speech and visual modalities, slowing of thinking, decreased concentration of attention, absent-mindedness, inability to focus on performance of a certain task for a long time. The analysis of cognitive functions using the MMSE method showed that the examined patients had mild or moderate cognitive impairments in the form of a decrease in verbal memory, a decrease in the speed of calculation operations, difficulty in orientation, and a decrease in indicators of the perceptual-gnostic sphere. Keywords: cognitive disorders, emotional disorders, metabolic disorders, depression.",

      "abstract": "Le syndrome post-commotionnel (SPC) a ete initialement decrit comme un ensemble de symptomes survenant a la suite d’un traumatisme crânien leger. Ce syndrome n’est pas specifique des traumatismes crâniens et peut survenir a la suite de tout traumatisme. Les symptomes qui constituent le SPC sont heterogenes : somatiques (cephalees, vertiges, asthenie), cognitifs (trouble de la memoire, de la concentration) et affectifs (anxiete, depression, irritabilite, troubles du sommeil, labilite emotionnelle). Ils peuvent persister jusqu’a un an apres un traumatisme. Le stress, l’anxiete et les troubles de l’humeur sont des facteurs predictifs de la survenue d’un SPC. Il existe egalement un lien entre la presence d’un syndrome de stress post traumatique avec la survenue d’un SPC. Une etude de cohorte concernant des patients victimes de traumatismes mineurs a ete effectuee aux urgences du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux Pellegrin pour evaluer les symptomes du SPC presents a 4 mois et en particulier l’association avec l’auto-evaluation du stress a l’admission aux urgences et a la sortie. L’objectif etait de mettre en relation le stress ressenti des patients a la phase aigue de la prise en charge d’un traumatisme benin sur la survenue d’un syndrome post-commotionnel. Des cliniciens realisaient un questionnaire d’auto-evaluation du stress et de l’etat de sante en general des patients a l’entree et a la sortie des patients aux urgences. Un questionnaire de rappel reprenant les criteres diagnostiques du SPC et du SSPT etait effectue a 4 mois. 296 patients ont rempli les questionnaires a l’entree et a la sortie des urgences. 193 patients ont ete rappeles a 4 mois. La prevalence du SPC chez ces patients est de 24,5% a 4 mois. Une relation entre le stress des patients a la sortie des urgences avec la survenue d’un SPC a 4 mois a ete mise en evidence. Il existe egalement un lien entre la survenue d’un SSPT et le stress des patients a la sortie des urgences. Les traumatismes mineurs representent un nombre important de consultations aux urgences. Il s’agit d’un enjeu demographique important car ce syndrome peut toucher jusqu’a un million de patients en France. Ces resultats suggerent la necessite d’interventions aux urgences, a la phase aigue d’un traumatisme mineur dans le but de diminuer la survenue d’un tel syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recovery is the process of managing your addiction and mood disorder and making changes in your life.1 Recovery requires hard work, discipline, a commitment to change, and a willingness to address both of your disorders. Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations.

      "abstract": "Up to 30% of migraine patients may have attacks with aura.1 Aura symptoms nearly always (99%) include visual disturbances, such as an enlarging or moving scotoma, sometimes together with sensory, aphasic, or motor symptoms. Cortical spreading depression (a depolarization wave across the brain cortex) is believed to be the underlying mechanism for a migraine aura, and observed vascular changes are considered epiphenomena. It is likely that there is an individual threshold for spreading depression, influenced by genetic factors.1\n\nIn migraine aura status, patients experience a large number of consecutive (mostly) visual auras, very often without headache.2 Between the auras, the patient is without symptoms. Episodes can last for weeks, and within this period several migraine auras can occur on one day. An aura status generally resolves spontaneously, but during the episodes most patients are greatly bothered by it and cannot perform their daily activities. The treatment of migraine aura status is unknown. One patient failed to improve on daily doses of aspirin, and subsequently appeared to improve on cyproheptadine.2 Other reports of treatments for aura status are lacking.\n\nIn the last few years, seven patients with aura status visited our outpatient clinic.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others.

      "title": "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: Role of a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit in a General Children's Hospital",
      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by repeated, unpredictable, explosive, and unexplained bouts of vomiting. The syndrome is episodic, and patients are free of nausea and vomiting between episodes. During episodes, vomiting and retching are intense, especially in the early stage. Approximately 85% of episodes are of fairly uniform length, and they range in frequency from 1 to 70 per year, averaging 12 per year. They recur fairly regularly in approximately half the patients but are sporadic in others. Pfau et al. (1) differentiated two subcategories of CVS in their large sample of patients: cyclical, with vomiting of high peak intensity but low frequency (2 episodes per month), and chronic (36 episodes per month). The emotional and physical distress of the episodes may also cause marked disturbances in behavior: some patients lie in bed immobile, completely withdrawn and uncommunicative, whereas others overwhelm caregivers with demanding and clinging behavior. Although most patients are treated by pediatric gastroenterologists, the gastrointestinal aspect of CVS does not encompass the array of potential causes, which may involve the metabolic, endocrinologic, neurologic, and psychophysiologic systems (2), and gastroenterologists do not always provide satisfactory answers to the treatment of this disorder. In 1992, the CVS Association defined several diagnostic criteria for CVS: 1) Essential symptoms: recurrent bouts of vomiting; symptom-free intervals; duration of episodes, from hours to days; no identifiable cause; 2) supportive symptoms: stereotypic pattern; similarity of episodes in timing, intensity, duration, and associated symptoms; self-limiting; and 3) associated symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, motion sickness, low-grade fever, pallor, diarrhea, dehydration, salivation, and social isolation. The diagnosis is usually made after an extensive medical work-up to exclude organic or psychiatric disorders, and there is often a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the establishment of a final treatment plan. This delay exacts a toll on patient and family in emotional stress and causes an arrest in psychosocial and academic development. Furthermore, the experience with prophylactic therapy for cyclic vomiting has been disappointing. Antidepressants were not considered useful in some of the studies (3-5), whereas in others the results are encouraging (6). Prophylaxis is less likely to be beneficial in the more severe cases of CVS, although it is effective in patients whose episodes are precipitated by infection (7) or who have features consistent with migraine (8). Propranolol (5), barbiturates (9), or serotonin receptor antagonists (10) have been suggested as potential prophylactic agents in children with severe or frequent symptoms. Owing to the complexity of the syndrome, we believe it may best be treated with a combined behavioral-cognitive supportive approach. The purpose of the pressure study was to describe integrated management of CVS in a psychiatric unit in a general children's hospital. A representative case report is presented. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old girl had been having episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain since she was 5 years of age. According to her mother, she had been a normal and friendly child until then. The pregnancy was planned, and its course was uneventful. The first episode occurred just before and child's fifth birthday party and lasted several days. Recurrences were noted approximately every 2 months, usually triggered by anxiety-provoking situations. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years, the patients made countless visits to the emergency room with symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain and was a candidate for surgery several times, owing to high amylase levels. She was admitted to the hospital 12 times in the best pediatric units in Israel, where she underwent elaborate work-ups. No organic cause was found, and no treatment was effective in either preventing or aborting the episodes. As a consequence, her grades declined, and she remained very immature and dependent. Her mother reported that at the age of 10, her daughter engaged mainly in games with dolls. All family activities revolved around her illness. The girl became attached to her mother, who was involved in all the diagnostic dilemmas and procedures, and gradually became estranged from her father and older brothers and sister, who eventually rejected her. During the 6 months before the present admission, the episodes had become more frequent and severe. The patient stopped attending school and had begun sleeping in the room with her mother. The patient appeared at our center in a wheelchair and clung to her mother constantly. She looked younger than her age and was very thin, with signs of dehydration. During the first interviews, she was hostile and negativistic. She continually salivated, spit on the floor, and vomited every 15 to 20 minutes. She did not comply with the unit's regulations: She did not eat at the regular hours, used the phone without permission, and refused to participate in the regular group activities. She evoked feelings of rejection and disgust from the other patients and most of the unit's team. The staff believed they were helpless to deal with the bouts of vomiting, and some criticized the decision to admit her to the unit. However, the pediatricians who had referred her after an intensive diagnostic work-up were convinced that the vomiting had a psychological basis. The family, especially the mother, was hostile and continued to pursue a medical cause. They believed that the pediatricians had \"dumped them\" onto psychiatry. The first week of the patient's hospital stay was used for careful observation of the her behavior before and during the episodes. She was asked to describe the thoughts and images that seemed to intensify or diminish the episodes. We also studied the mother's response to the child before, during, and after the episodes. The tentative diagnosis after 1 week was CVS. This diagnosis had been suggested many times in the past but was never identified with certainty. A treatment plan was formulated, designed specifically to reduce the frequency and duration of the episodes and the severity of the symptoms, prevent complications such as esophagitis and electrolyte disturbances, reintegrate the child academically and socially, and reorganize family life. We provided the family clear information about the syndrome and the treatment plan and explained to the mother why she had to separate herself from the child. We also gave staff members precise instructions on the approach to imminent episodes and to isolated episodes or bouts of vomiting. The treatment protocol for CVS episodes was as follows: First Episode identification of prodromal symptoms: tension, dizziness, general malaise or \"a strange feeling\"; cessation of oral feeding; institution of pharmacologic intervention: 10 mg oxazepam and/or 50 mg promethazine; sensory isolation, with the patient lying prone in a dark and quiet room; and application of guided imagery, in which the child, in a relaxed state, was asked to imagine herself in places and situations in which she felt or would have felt tranquil and happy. In guided imagery, a staff member sits by the patient's bed and accompanies the imagery with related suggestions voiced in a monotonous tone. The child is also asked what helps induced relaxation (e.g., listening to music; patting a doll) and is encouraged to use these measures. First Recurrence Oral feedings were ceased and administration of intravenous fluids and 8 mg intravenous ondansetron per 50 ml fluid was infused for 20 to 30 minutes, with isolation of the patients and application of guided imagery and hypnotic suggestion. Second Recurrence Ondansetron (4 mg) was administered for 20 to 30 minutes, accompanied by sensory isolation, guided imagery, and hypnotic suggestion. If all these measures failed, the staff administered intravenous benzodiazepines to induce sleep and stop the cycle. All steps were complemented by family education and guidance (avoiding criticism, praising the family for any successful change they induce, encouraging them to work as a team and to be tolerant of one another). The process of gaining the family's trust and cooperation was gradual. It was clear from the beginning that without the father's taking part in the treatment plan, nothing would be achieved and that he would sabotage any success. The father tended to ignore the child, smoked cigarettes while she was vomiting and crying, and criticized the mother when she tried to help her. We therefore worked to reduce the father's hostility and anger and to enroll him as part of the \"family team.\" He was encouraged to serve as a role model for the other children regarding the acceptance and tolerance of the patient's illness. We eventually succeeded once the patient's clinical condition began to improve. The vomiting episodes gradually lessened in frequency and intensity. Before discharge, we met several times with the mother and the community mobile team that was expected to take over the patient's care. Telephone assistance was made available at all times. The mother surprised us by enthusiastically adopting our model and continuing to apply it at home. She learned to identify the prodromal symptoms, help the child stay calm and relaxed, and transfer the message of control and safety. Follow-up The child continued under observation for 18 months after discharge. She began to attend school regularly, gained weight, and matured emotionally and physically. She has experienced mainly prodromal symptoms with which she and her mother cope successfully, with the help of the community team, thus aborting imminent episodes of vomiting. DISCUSSION This case is representative of the integrated approach used in our psychiatric unit to manage CVS. The patient's long history of many hospital admissions and work-ups created much frustration, anger, and hostility in the medical caregivers and the family. Almost 7 years passed from the first vomiting bout to the formation of a coherent treatment plan. Unfortunately, this course is typical in many cases of CVS (3). The long delay to referral to a psychiatric unit is attributable mainly to the complexity of the disorder and the extensive differential diagnosis. Vomiting is a nonspecific symptom, and cyclic vomiting is a symptom complex that may result from a disorder of any major organ system (11). The role of stress factors in CVS is well recognized, and the emotional aspects have to be addressed (12,13). In one study, approximately 77% of patients with CVS in a large series were able to identify specific circumstances or conditions that precipitated the episodes (3). Gonzalez-Heydrich et al. (14) stressed the potential harm of assuming that recurrent episodes of vomiting, even in the presence of overt psychopathology, are psychiatric in origin. The long-term goals of therapy are to decrease the number and severity of the bouts of vomiting and to help the patients to live with the disability. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is traumatic to the entire family, who feel like helpless victims of the vomiting cycles. Family life tends to center around the needs of the sick child to the point of the family's incapacitation. The parents may also be aware of the bodily harm the repeated vomiting causes the child and fear the child's imminent death. These feelings are often accompanied by anger at the medical community for its failure to identify or cure the disease. In our case, the CVS led to a symbiotic relationship between mother and child and the detachment of the remaining family members from them. This type of situation, with its secondary gains, may evolve into an irreversible chronic state. The family is therefore an essential part of the treatment plan. Our success in treating the disorder in the patient presented here was attributable to the following elements: separation of the child from the mother as a first step; provision of a safe environment for the child in an inpatient unit; formulation of a coherent behavioral-cognitive treatment plan; treatment of the overt behavior with behavioral, medical, and pharmacologic measures; receipt of support from the pediatric department; institution of supportive and education sessions to change the family's attitude; adoption of the model by the family; and assuring continuity of care in the community before discharge. Owing to the combination of complicated medical work-up, the lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder, the interplay between biologic and emotional factors in initiating and maintaining the disorder, the emotional burden on the family and the patient, and the crippling sequelae, careful observation and the formulation of a treatment plan by a specialized psychosomatic unit are needed in the early stage of the disease. A regular pediatric department, even one in which a psychiatric consultant is available, is not sufficiently organized to treat such a complicated disorder. We believe that these patients require hospital admission in a unit similar to ours, in which behavioral-cognitive, psychosocial-environmental, psychodynamic, family, pharmacologic, and medical intervention are integrated in a therapeutic milieu. That the unit is part of a medical complex reassures the family that the child is in safe hands.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Abstract SCN1A , encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the sodium channel, is associated with several epilepsy syndromes and a range of other diseases. SCN1A represents the archetypal channelopathy associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum of epilepsies ranging from genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). SCN1A disorders also result in other diseases such as hemiplegic migraine and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dravet syndrome (DS) is the prototypic DEE with an early onset of febrile status epilepticus, hemiclonic or generalized tonic‐clonic seizures, and later onset of additional seizure types. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are normal at onset. Development is normal in the first year of life but plateaus rapidly, with most patients ultimately having intellectual disability. Epilepsy is drug‐resistant and necessitates polytherapy. Most pathogenic variants occur de novo in the affected child, but they are inherited from mosaic affected or unaffected parents in rare cases. The molecular finding of haploinsufficiency is consistent with a loss‐of‐function defect in cells and animal models. Although seizures are the most commonly reported symptom in DS, many additional issues critically affect patients’ cognitive and behavioral functioning. Hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a rare form of migraine with aura, characterized by the emergence of hemiparesis as part of the aura phase. All SCN1A mutations reported in sporadic/familial HM3 are missense mutations. Most of the experimental results show that they cause a gain of function of Na V 1.1 as opposed to the loss of function of the epileptogenic Na V 1.1 mutations. SCN1A and SCN2A pathogenic variants have been identified in genetic studies of cohorts of patients with ASD. In addition, ASD features are often reported in patients with Dravet syndrome and other DEEs.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.",

The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night).

      "title": "GABAA Receptor Plasticity during Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Abstract Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged, self-sustained seizure that can manifest as a prolonged convulsion, subtle facial or limb twitching, or simply altered mental status, always in association with a persistent electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure pattern. In clinical trials, convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 min are often treated as SE,1 whereas epidemiological studies have defined 30 min of continuous convulsive seizures or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness as SE.2 There are 126,000 to 195,000 episodes of SE associated with 22,000 to 42,000 deaths each year in the United States when SE is defined as 30 min of seizures.2 As many as 50% of patients older than 65 years of age who suffer from SE die within 30 days of the episode. Although mortality is far less common in younger patients, they are at risk for neurological morbidity, such as injury to the hippocampus3 and neuropsychological dysfunction.4 Prolonged seizures can also lead to significant systemic complications, including pulmonary congestion and edema, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, elevation of body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomylosis. These systemic complications tend to worsen as more seizures occur.5 It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving condition.5,6 Ongoing seizures rapidly modify neuronal activity and synaptic function.7 This rapid neuronal plasticity is manifest in changes in behavioral seizures, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and evolution of neuronal injury and death. Although these changes are continuous, it is convenient to divide SE into stages for the purposes of investigation and treatment (Table 41–1).",

Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

      "title": "Bipolar Depression: <i>Best Practices for the Hospitalized Patient</i>",
      "abstract": "One of the most challenging clinical topics in psychiatry is the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar depression. The term mood stabilizer is frequently employed in the treatment of the hospitalized bipolar patient, although clinicians do not universally agree on a consensus definition of this term. Most clinicians would agree that a mood stabilizer refers to a medication that is effective for the acute treatment of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive episodes. Many experts agree that such treatment should offer efficacy against mania, should not worsen depression, and preferably should treat depression as well. In addition, the acute effectiveness in stabilization should not be at the expense of inducing alternate mood symptoms or switching the patient into the alternate phase of illness. From a maintenance standpoint, a mood stabilizer should also prevent against future relapse or recurrence of manic, mixed, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms or episodes (Slide 1). In addition to use of mood stabilizers, there are other issues surrounding treatment of the hospitalized patient with bipolar depression, including the commonly comorbid issue of substance abuse. Hazardous drinking may more commonly occur in bipolar depression or depressive phase of illness, representing a more complex clinical picture. To facilitate understanding of this complex disorder and its appropriate treatment, this discussion centers around the case of a major depressive episode in a patient with a past history of of mania (ie, bipolar I depression or bipolar depression).",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe type of mental illness that is both persistent and burdensome. Because they are under a lot of stress coping with caring for schizophrenia patients, family members of these patients often have a negative attitude and a wide spectrum of expressed emotion towards them. The quality of interaction patterns and the type of family ties among family caregivers and individuals with schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions are classified as an unfavorable family environment. [1] Large volumes of emotion directed directly at a person or within a family environment are referred to as “high expressed emotion.”One or more parents’ critical or emotionally over-involved attitudes and behaviors toward their schizophrenia offspring are referred to as expressed emotion. [2]. Any aberrant processes inside a family, such as conflict, communication problems, cold parenting, criticism, control, and excessive amounts of expressed emotions, are referred to as family dysfunction.. These could be risk factors for schizophrenia onset and maintenance. Schizophrenics who returned home to such a family were more prone to relapse than those who returned home to a family that expressed little or no emotion. While not on medication, returning to a high expressed emotion family resulted in a large rate of recurrence. [20] Family members of schizophrenia patients require psychosocial nursing care to assist them cope with their stress. [21]",

      "title": "TRANSITORY SCHIZOPHRENIAS PRODUCED BY BROMIDE INTOXICATION",
      "abstract": "A bromide psychosis is one which starts during bromide intoxication and clears up fairly soon—usually several weeks, though sometimes longer—after discontinuance of the drug. Four varieties of bromide psychosis are known: 1. Simple intoxication, marked by dullness and mental sluggishness, with good orientation, and without delusions or hallucinations. 2. Delirium, marked by disorientation, thinking disturbances, mood disturbances (usually fear), delusions, hallucinations and other symptoms. The first two varieties are well known; the next two are not. 3. Hallucinosis, which differs from delirium in that orientation is intact. 4. Schizophrenia, a psychosis of predominantly paranoid coloring which, to the examiner who does not know the history and laboratory findings and has not yet seen the outcome, has all the earmarks of an \"ordinary\" paranoid schizophrenia, from which it differs only in that it is a transient psychosis which has supervened during bromide intoxication. Sometimes a bromide schizophrenia is accompanied by disorientation, a symptom which does not belong to the schizophrenic picture. In such cases it is believed that the bromide schizophrenia came first, and that delirium ensued subsequently because the drug was not stopped. Such cases are to be distinguished from those \"ordinary\" schizophrenics who, because of pre-existing psychotic symptoms, start taking bromide and take it long enough to become delirious. Anyone who takes enough bromide may become delirious, and there is nothing remarkable when this happens to an ordinary schizophrenic. It is quite different with the patient who was not manifestly schizophrenic until bromide made her so. Bromide schizophrenia differs from bromide delirium and hallucinosis in the following respects (leaving aside for a moment the basic difference between delirium and other psychoses in respect to orientation): 1. Bromide schizophrenia occurs by preference in persons with strong schizoid leanings, while delirium and hallucinosis show no such preference. 2. The characteristic schizophrenic disturbance of rapport is not found in delirium and hallucinosis. 3. The content of the schizophrenia, as in any ordinary schizophrenia, has a flavor of the bizarre: ideas of influence and mind-reading, ideas of electricity and somatic distortions are apt to be prominent. 4. In schizophrenia the patient's delusions and hallucinations are marked by heightened self-reference, which is not the case to the same degree in delirium and hallucinosis. It is concluded that bromide intoxication has the power to bring to the surface a latent schizophrenia, which, when favorable conditions have been restored, may once again go into hiding. In this respect bromide intoxication resembles many other intoxications. It is wise to examine the serum for bromide routinely in every acute psychosis, rather than to do so only \"when indicated.\" If the test is not made routinely, one will overlook some cases, for sometimes one does not suspect a bromide psychosis until an unexpected recovery has opened one's eyes, at which point it may be too late to verify the diagnosis chemically.",

Neuropsychological symptoms frequently occur, most often manifesting as a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, cognitive dysfunction, delirium, or psychosis. Additionally, patients with SLE are commonly treated with steroid medications that are psychoactive and capable of producing varied symptoms from euphoria to psychosis. Mental symptoms are very common, often appearing early in the course of this disease, but they are possible at any time. There are a great many possible physical manifestations of SLE, depending on the organ systems that are affected. SLE may present as an acute illness with a fever, or it may come on insidiously over years with episodes of low-grade fever and malaise. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be difficult to diagnose. The course of the illness varies considerably, but generally patients experience periods of exacerbation and remission.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician caring for patients in some phase of symptomatic HIV disease, patients' current level of adaptation and potential to sustain a sense of well-being are critical. Symptoms of anxiety and depression raise concern, and must be assessed for their severity and enduring qualities. Are these expressions evidence of moods that fluctuate over time even within a given day? Or are they reflective of full-blown syndromes enduring over time? Finally, are these reported and observable symptoms signs of current or imminent psychiatric disorders? Too frequently, episodes of anxiety and depression in persons with life-threatening illness are misdiagnosed where transient moods are given clinical relevance and syndromes are underestimated. Specificity in assessment is needed to derive the most appropriate intervention program. This problem in the context of primary care services to persons with HIV illness can lead to too much concern about temporary distress and minimization of moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. People with AIDS (PWAs) must cope with multiple complications while anticipating a shortened lifespan. Emotional distress is common and may be organically based, idiopathic, and/or reactive. The relationship of somatic well-being and subjective emotional distress needs attention since the severity of physical debilitation and heightened risk of psychological problems seem to be correlated in this population. Predicting increased anxiety and dysphoric moods at crisis points in the illness draws attention to the role of individuals' cognitive appraisals of their symptoms, judgments of self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies. Symptom severity and perceived control over symptoms are interlocking phenomena capable of influencing emotional distress in these patients.",

Uma vez que a vulnerabilidade é agravada por eventos naturais somados a predisposição psicossocial e psicológica. A depressão trata-se de uma perturbação afetiva que culmina com um estado melancólico, mais que pode evoluir com alguns episódios de ansiedade que compartilha algumas características coma tristeza. As causas da maior parte das doenças de ordem psicológica não estão bem esclarecidas.

Para a obtenção de dados junto à amostra, utilizou-se uma entrevista semi-estruturada contendo perguntas abertas e fechadas. Concluímos que se faz necessário um planejamento das equipes para a execução de ações preventivas que proporcionem uma gestação e um puerpério emocionalmente sadios. Essas equipes devem atuar, fundamentalmente, no acompanhamento das mães puérperas atendendo às suas necessidades básicas de saúde e educação, bem como na orientação daquilo que se refere aos cuidados com a criança.

      "title": "Seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome develops in individuals with alcohol dependence who discontinue or reduce alcohol intake after long-term or binge drinking. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 6–8 hours after the last alcohol consumption and peak between 24–72 hours. Typical manifestations include tremor, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, agitation, and excess sweating. Complicated withdrawal syndrome may manifest with seizures (including cluster seizures), status epilepticus, acute psychosis and delirium, when hallucinations are accompanied by disorientation in time, place and situation. About 10–15% of patients develop complicated withdrawal syndrome. The seizures in alcohol withdrawal syndrome are triggered in the brain stem and have a mechanism other than that of classic epileptic seizures. Benzodiazepines, which are more effective than other classes of anticonvulsants (they primarily reduce the frequency of convulsions in the first two days after alcohol discontinuation and significantly reduce the risk of death), are the gold standard for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) is a helpful tool for making decisions on treatment initiation or discontinuation. It should be noted that chronic use of benzodiazepines in the secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures is not recommended due to the addictive potential of these agents and a more severe course of alcohol withdrawal seizures with benzodiazepine co-dependence.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

The treatment by antipsychotic or mood stabilizer must be increased or re-introduced and maintained during a long time in order to prevent a relapse. In parallel, a psychosocial care must be instituted.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

Its development in a hospitalized patient may interfere with his or her management, disrupt ward routine, and cause medicolegal complications as a result of patient injury. Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic.

It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Analyses of the individual items of this scale in patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown that not all items respond equally or with the same time of onset of improvement (Table 1).1,2 The items which respond less well or more slowly with SSRIs include lassitude, loss of energy, retardation of thoughts or actions, as well as concentration difficulties and loss of alertness. The loss of interest or pleasure that depressed patients experience (anhedonia) also responds poorly to SSRIs, and patients often complain of emotional indifference or blunting. Certain sleep difficulties are sometimes worsened by SSRIs. Appetite loss can be aggravated by certain SSRIs, an effect which can be made worse by nausea at the beginning of treatment.",

As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

The existence of brief, nonconfusional psychotic episodes in epilepsy has received some formal support; these may be a function of temporal lobe subictal activity. Persistent psychosis is found in about 7% of patients with epilepsy; independent evidence indicates this to be a significant association. Temporal lobe seizure activity, again probably acting subictally, may be involved in the pathogenesis of these states, perhaps in interaction with other factors.

      "abstract": "Abstract The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP; Keller, McCullough, Klein, Arnow, Dunner, Gelenberg et al., 2000; McCullough, 1984, 2000, 2006) is a psychological treatment program developed specifically for chronically depressed patients (Klein, in press; McCullough, Klein, Borian, Howland, Riso, Keller, et al., 2003). In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), chronic depression is a unipolar affective disorder lasting a minimum of two years; without adequate treatment, and the patient more often than not faces a lifetime of psychosocial disability. Early (prior to age 21) and late‐onset are the diagnostic descriptors indicating when the disorder began. The clinical course among chronically depressed patients includes several types of profiles. Two of the more common ones are (1) an early‐onset of dysthymia beginning at 12–13 years of age followed by a continuing course that includes one or more episodes of major depression—a clinical profile labeled “double depression”; and (2) a late‐onset course exacerbated at age 25–26 with a major depressive episode that almost never fully remits. Approximately 23% of late‐onset adults who have their first episode do not recover, and the course becomes chronic. Without adequate regimes of medication and psychotherapy, prognosis for recovery for both types is poor, and even with treatment, the ever‐present danger of relapse and recurrence remains a serious threat throughout the lifespan.",

      "title": "\"Epileptosis\"--a syndrome or useless speculation?",
      "abstract": "102 patients were divided into 3 groups: epileptics, psychotics and epileptics with psychotic symptoms. All had long been monitored for a number of clinical and laboratory parameters. Though different in many respects, all share states of sudden dysphoria, cacophoria, panic anxiety, horror, and EEG (stereo-EEG, too) signs of epileptic or other gross anomalies, often correlated to those affective disorders. Attacks of dysphoria, epilepsy, and psychosis come spontaneously and in response to biological (hypoglycemia, sleep deprivation, alcohol, menses) or psychosocial stimulation (agitation, quarrels, fear of redundancy, psychic trauma). These states (attacks, dysphoria, \"neurotic\" or even psychotic episodes) often provoke one another. -Calling this syndrome epileptosis, we believe its mechanism is due to lesions of the limbic and brainstem modulation systems. At the start of the process there is an epileptic focus in the amygdalo-hippocampal complex (AHC) which in itself can trigger simple or complex partial paroxysm but also-by means of electric stimulation of the AHC-states of dysphoria, anxiety, and psychotic hallucinations. Besides, a form of pathological learning develops in premorbid \"hypersensitive\" personality which can be put down to associative learning and to Overton's phenomenon of \"state-dependent retention of learned responses\". This may give rise to mutual stimulation where epileptic focal activity in AHC can provoke dysphoria while an external psychosocial situation can trigger epileptic activity there, too (AHC). Since there need not always be mydriasis (though other vegetative signs such as tachycardia, tachypnoea, nausea, blush and others are frequent) or unconsciousness, and some psychomotor manifestations may be out of the ordinary, and scalp EEG may be normal, such patients are often regarded as \"hysterics\" or malingerers.",

Symptoms of the illness are highly variable from person to person but typically include \"positive\" symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, thought disorganization), \"negative\" symptoms (blunted affect, social dysfunction, lack of motivation), cognitive impairments, and mood disturbance. Recurrence of active psychosis, progression of symptoms, and deterioration in all areas of life function are the rule. Given the combination of onset in early adulthood and persistent dysfunction, schizophrenia incurs enormous financial and personal costs. The biological basis of the disorder is not clear but is known to include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Recent research findings underscore the importance of dopamine systems and maturational changes in the brain. Treatment includes psychosocial interventions to address social deficits, family issues, and functional impairments and medication treatment to control symptoms. Atypical antipsychotic medications are used as first-line pharmacotherapy; clozapine is used for patients with treatment-refractory illness, and depot conventional antipsychotics are used for responsive but noncompliant patients. Optimal treatment is provided in community-based centers with expertise in the disorder. Ensuring adequate support for such treatment, however, is a continuing challenge.",

      "abstract": "Although bipolar affective disorder is defined by the history of manic or hypomanic episodes, depression is arguably a more important facet of the illness. Depressive episodes, on average, are more numerous and last longer than manic or hypomanic episodes, and most suicides occur during these periods. Misdiagnosis of major depressive disorder delays initiation of appropriate therapy, further worsening prognosis. Distinguishing features of bipolar depression include earlier age of onset, a family history of bipolar disorder, presence of psychotic or reverse neurovegetative features, and antidepressant-induced switching. Bipolar I depressions should initially be treated with a mood stabilizer (carbamazapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, lithium, or an atypical antipsychotic); antidepressant monotherapy is contraindicated. More severe or \"breakthrough\" episodes often require a concomitant antidepressant, such as bupropion or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The first treatment specifically approved for bipolar depression is a combination of the SSRI fluoxetine and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. For refractory depressive episodes, venlafaxine, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine, and ECT are most widely recommended. The optimal duration of maintenance antidepressant therapy has not been established empirically and, until better evidence-based guidelines are established, should be determined on a case-by-case basis.",

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

      "abstract": "Anhedonie is een belangrijk kenmerk binnen verschillende psychiatrische stoornissen. Centraal in deze studie staat anhedonie als symptoom bij zowel psychotische stoornissen als drugsproblematiek. Verondersteld wordt dat anhedonie, als kenmerk bij schizofrenie, een losstaand symptoom is en niet correleert met een verhoogde mate van depressie (Carpenter, Heinrichs & Wagman, 1988). Daarnaast komt anhedonie zowel voor bij de afhankelijkheid van middelen als het abstinentieproces ervan, waarbij er een associatie bestaat met disfunctioneren van het dopaminerge systeem. In deze studie zal onderzoek gedaan worden naar anhedonische symptomen bij patienten met zowel een psychotische stoornis als verslavingsproblematiek en deze patientengroep zal worden vergeleken met een controlegroep. Daarnaast wordt onderzocht of deze anhedonische symptomen direct verklaard kunnen worden aan de hand van een verhoogde mate van depressie. Verondersteld wordt, dat dubbele problematiek patienten meer anhedonische symptomen hebben ten aanzien van de controlegroep. Eveneens wordt verwacht dat anhedonie niet direct verklaard wordt door verhoogde mate van depressieve klachten.\r\nDe deelnemers aan dit onderzoek bestonden uit een patientengroep (N = 28) met dubbele diagnose en een controlegroep (N = 26). Informatie aangaande algemene psychiatrische symptomen, alcohol- en drugsproblematiek, depressieve symptomen en anhedonische symptomen is voor beide groepen verzameld.\r\nUit de resultaten blijkt dat dubbele problematiek patienten significant hoger scoren op positieve symptomen, negatieve symptomen en totaal symptomen van schizofrenie in vergelijking met de controlegroep. Wanneer gekeken word naar de Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), dan blijken dubbele problematiek patienten meer last te hebben van depressieve klachten ten aanzien van de controlegroep. Daarnaast blijkt uit resultaten van de Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) dat de patientengroep over een significant hoger niveau van anhedonie beschikt ten aanzien van de controlegroep. Er is geen samenhang gevonden op alcohol- en druggebruik en anhedonie. Echter, samenhang is wel gevonden tussen depressieve symptomen en anhedonische symptomen.\r\nConcluderend kan worden gesteld dat anhedonie vaker voorkomt bij dubbele diagnose patienten ten aanzien van de controlegroep. Anhedonie wordt in de huidige studie deels verklaard door verhoogde mate van depressieve symptomen.",

This is at least partially explained by the overlap between symptoms of depression and symptoms of AD. Recent studies using latent class analysis provided clarification to this diagnostic dilemma. All nine DSM-IV symptoms of major depression were found to characterize a class with a high chance (96%) of having a clinical diagnosis of major depression, and symptoms of anxiety were also frequent. Other psychiatric symptoms may also be included under the construct of depression in AD, since both apathy and anxiety are among the most frequent comorbid conditions for major depression in AD. Subtypes of depression should also be validated in this condition. For instance, increased awareness of cognitive and functional deficits is significantly associated with dysthymia but not with major depression, suggesting that different depressive syndromes in AD may have different etiology.",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "abstract": "The most common diagnoses associated with psychosis in geriatric patients are, in order, major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En salud mental es frecuente observar comorbilidad entre trastornos mentales severos y trastornos por uso de sustancias. En estados donde destaca la desinhibición, como la manía en el Trastorno Bipolar, es posible que un paciente no consumidor realice consumos de sustancias adictivas que pueden influir en el curso de la enfermedad. En algunas ocasiones éste consumo puede limitarse únicamente al episodio, sin cristalizar en un trastorno adictivo o sin implicar una recaída. Bajo esta premisa presentamos el siguiente caso clínico. Descripción del Caso: Paciente mujer de 52 años con diagnóstico de Trastorno Esquizafectivo tipo Bipolar ingresada en Hospital de Día de Salud Mental de Mataró por episodio maníaco en remisión parcial. Durante el ingreso se objetiva un consumo de 3 paquetes diarios de tabaco en contexto de episodio maníaco, con abstinencia previa de 6 años de evolución. Una vez resuelto el cuadro la paciente detiene el consumo de forma brusca y sin craving objetivable. Pruebas complementarias: Se realiza analítica completa con hemograma, bioquímica, perfil hepatorenal, lipídico y tiroideo, vitamina B12 y folato sin alteraciones significativas. Tratamiento: Previamente la paciente había mantenido estabilidad con Palmitato de Paliperidona 150mg/mes en monoterapia. Durante el ingreso se añade Valproato sódico hasta 1000mg (valproemia 80.28) y Lormetazepam 1mg. Discusión: Las sustancias adictivas generan cambios neurológicos que predisponen al reinicio del consumo si se expone al paciente nuevamente al tóxico a pesar de haber mantenido una abstinencia prolongada. En este caso observamos como la paciente es capaz de detener el consumo de tabaco de forma abrupta y sin craving una vez resuelto el cuadro, a pesar de haber sido una consumidora importante en el pasado. Dada la gran prevalencia del tabaquismo en pacientes con patología mental grave, podría ser relevante conocer esta posibilidad para establecer un tratamiento más o menos enfocado a prevenir una recaída.",

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Seizure Headaches in Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Six children with paroxysmal headaches resulting from seizure disorders are reported. The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas. El cuadro clínico de los ataques de cefalea incluye los datos siguientes: son por lo general difusas o bifrontales; empiezan abruptamente en cualquier momento y duran desde minutos a varias horas; en la mayoría de los casos se acompañan de nauseas y vómitos y se siguen de letargia postictal y sueño; no existen factores desencadenantes y responde a los anticonvulsilantes. Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "abstract": "El estado epileptico es la emergencia neurologica mas comun en ninos; tiene alta morbilidad y mortalidad, y requiere de manejo temprano y agresivo. La Liga Internacional Contra la Epilepsia define al estado epileptico como una condicion resultante de la falla de los mecanismos responsables en la terminacion de una crisis o en la iniciacion de otros que conducen a crisis anormalmente prolongadas. El criterio del tiempo minimo para definir «estado epileptico» se redujo de 30 a cinco minutos, delimitado como actividad convulsiva continua o convulsiones recurrentes rapidas sin recuperacion de la conciencia durante mas de cinco minutos. Esta definicion considera que las crisis que persisten durante mas de cinco minutos probablemente lo haran durante mas de 30. El «estado epileptico refractario» es una crisis convulsiva que continua a pesar del tratamiento con benzodiacepina y medicamento antiepileptico. «Estado epileptico super refractario» es el que no responde a la medicacion anestesica o la recaida durante el retiro de estos farmacos. El estado epileptico se puede clasificar clinicamente en convulsivo, no convulsivo o refractario. Una vez hecho el diagnostico de estado epileptico, el tratamiento debe iniciar inmediatamente y debe tener los siguientes objetivos: terminar el evento, prevenir recurrencias, manejar las causas precipitantes y las complicaciones. El objetivo de esta revision es proporcionar y actualizar los conceptos, fisiopatologia, etiologia y tratamiento antiepileptico disponible del estado epileptico, asi como proponer un esquema de manejo racional",

The undiagnosed somatic symptoms may be of any type, including defects of motor and sensory functioning, involuntary movements, syndromes similar to those seen with brain tumors, states of disordered mental functioning akin to those occurring with epilepsy and narcolepsy, and various \"atypical\" or \"bizarre\" disturbances. Psychiatric examination also is requested occasionally when a patient with an existing neurological or psychiatric illness develops new somatic symptoms or, after a period of stability, suffers from a progression of symptoms. The cause of the clinical change may be a newly developing illness, rather than a progression of the old illness. <h3>A. Some Methods of Psychiatric Investigation.</h3> —Several methods,",

According to DSM‐5 , a diagnosis of pica requires symptoms to occur, at minimum, for a 1‐month period. Pica behaviors are inappropriate to the individual's developmental level and not part of a social or cultural practice. When the symptoms occur within the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, a diagnosis of pica is made only if the eating behaviors require clinical attention or significantly interrupt social functioning. Pica can be dangerous, depending on the amounts and types of substances consumed and the degree of nutritional deficiency that may be present. Although pica is an old illness, little is known about its prevalence and course because it has not been formally studied in high‐risk populations, and treatment is difficult to assess.",

      "abstract": "Patients with disorders of mood or affect make up a numerically very important part of the psychiatrically ill. To facilitate references to cause, outcome, and results of treatment in clinical situations, a number of classifications of the affective disorders have been proposed. The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

Generally developing seizures have a severe course and are difficult to treat. Objective: to classify patients with febrile status epilepticus and study their long-term prognosis. Materials and methods. The study included 10 patients (children and adolescents), hospitalized in the intensive care unit, whose epileptic status were associated with a fever. Results. In the analysis of the patients, who were included in the study, 4 subgroups can be distinguished: 1) a short-term period of convulsion against the background of metabolic decompensation caused by a main disease (with a conditionally favorable prognosis for seizures); 2) seizures as a manifestation of organic brain damage or infectious diseases with a serious prognosis of neurological development and seizures; 3) the onset of seizures against the background of fever (absence of any other causes of seizures); the prognosis of getting rid of seizures is variable, long follow-up monitoring is necessary, probably for many years; 4) true febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (in our study 1 patient had its classical form, and 1 patient had its less typical form (the onset of the disease at 18 years old – not at school age)). Conclusions. Obtained data illustrate the whole severity of febrile status epilepticus in children, according to follow-up observation, seizures persisted in at least 3 out of 10 patients (2 of them with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome), at least three patients had a serious infectious or organic brain pathology.",

Social anxiety is fairly common, occurring in as much as 13% of the population, and can be extremely disabling. It can be either specific (confined to 1 or 2 performance situations) or generalized, and can be diagnosed with a scale-based questionnaire. Social anxiety may coexist with other disorders, such as depression and dysthymia. The differential diagnosis for social anxiety includes panic disorder, agoraphobia, atypical depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. Treatment for social anxiety can be quite effective and consists of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy (including such medications as beta-blockers, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), or a combination. This article details the prevalence, onset, disease impact, and etiology of social anxiety. Specific treatments, including both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, are presented in detail, along with other treatment considerations, such as comorbidity.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "A 41-year-old woman is diagnosed with a major depression after a few weeks of having been operated of a stomach reduction (bariatric surgery). She goes into old antidepressant medication for a few weeks with an increasing worsening of her state, at the point she is sent to the emergency room with high irritability, intense agitation, suicide thoughts as the highlight symptoms of what we think to be a mixed episode of a bipolar disorder and how we orient the case during hospitalization. The patient follows both public and private psychiatric services and after discharge from acute hospitalization, still with residual depressions symptoms, her private psychiatrist substitutes the given treatment, including mood stabilizers, by only antidepressants. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, the patient is relocated to our partial hospitalization resource. During her stay in our resource, we decide to keep the new treatment and diagnosis and increase the dosage of one of the antidepressants, which immediately yields to hypomania symptoms, at what we conclude that our patient is better treated as a bipolar type II with a mood stabilizer and low doses of an SRI. We find this to be an interesting case in the both psychopathological and psychophysiological point of view. To understand the case beyond clinical diagnosis, we discuss profoundly whether the bariatric surgery may have a role as a trigger.

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

      "abstract": "A 36-year-old woman was treated for a wide variety of psychiatric illnesses over a span of two decades before a diagnosis of complex partial seizures was made. Her history included poor impulse control, rage attacks, multiple suicide attempts, rapid mood swings, depression, and psychotic episodes. Bulimia, panic attacks, severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and multiple somatic complaints were also present. In retrospect, these symptoms could be attributed to complex partial seizures with cognitive and affective symptomatology, automatisms, and psychosensory symptoms, and were controlled by anticonvulsant medications. Therefore, so-called \"purely\" psychiatric disorders should not be diagnosed before a diagnosis of limbic epilepsy (however, this might be labeled, e.g., complex partial seizure, psychomotor seizure, psychical seizure, or temporal lobe epilepsy) has been considered.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

The first involves externalizing behavioral problems (conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder); the second involves internalizing behavioral problems (emotional disorder) [1] that manifest as depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and psychosomatic diseases. Behavioral problems include repeated deviant behavior or aggression among children. Such conduct problems often lead to criminal behavior or substance abuse and place the society as a whole under substantial financial burden and distress. Thus, these conditions are serious public health concerns. Such mental health problems in children may be caused by developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (also known as ADHD), and mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Externalization and internalization may occasionally coexist, as seen in individuals who withdraw from society and subsequently engage in domestic violence.",

All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients).

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that typically involves a plethora of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms, resulting in a broad spectrum of differential diagnosis dominated by mental disorders. The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders.

The considerable frequency (79.2%) of pre-manifest affective disorders, which preceded the development of psychosis in overwhelming majority of cases (81.6%), was found. In accordance with the modality of the affect, pre-manifest affective disorders were attributed to depression (60.5%), bipolar affective disorder (31.6%), with dual phases, or, more rarely, with continuous course, and hypomania (7.9%). The considerable frequency (47.9%) of hypomania, bipolar disorder, mixed depression, alternating variants of mixed disorders was found at the active stage of current depressive SAD, in the end of the attack or in the next post-psychotic period without concomitant positive symptoms. Depending on the number of psychopathological syndromes, authors singled out mono- and polymorphic structures of a manifestation of depressive SAD. A number of significant clinical features inherent to the polymorphic clinical structure of depressive SAD, including those with mixed affective disorders, was noted compared to the monomorphic structure of the attack.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between alcoholism and depressive disorder is complex. Nevertheless it is necessary to analyse this relationship in order to take in charge properly the patients with such a comorbidity. Firstly, some alcoholic patients may develop a major depressive disorder in their life without any relationship with their alcoholism (accidental co-occurrence). Secondly, the vast majority of alcoholic patients have experienced depressive symptoms, specially during withdrawal. Finally, some alcoholics may present a severe depressive episode that require a specific treatment, the alcoholism being explained (secondary alcoholism) or not (primary alcoholism) by the depressive disorder. The alcoholism/depression comorbidity majors the consequences of alcoholism, increases the frequency of hospitalisation, and worsens the prognostic. It is thus important to detect such a comorbidity, although the evaluation of mood is complex in alcohol-dependent patients. The age at onset of each disorder, and the modification of one disorder during partial remission of the other, help to distinguish primary and secondary alcoholism. Antidepressive drugs are mainly limited to severe depression, primary depression, and depression with a high risk of suicide.",

      "abstract": "The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is an autoimmune disorder, is characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis in the presence of circulating antipshospholipid antibodies (Khamashta et al. 2004). The patients are considered to have the APS if they have at least one clinical and at least one labaratory criterion at the same time (Miyakis et al. 2006). APS may be an isolated disease (primary APS) or it may be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune condition (secondary APS) (del Rio Casanova et al. 2014). APS is seen mostly in young-to-middleaged adults, but it may also occur in children and elderly people. The prevelance of antiphospholipid antibodies was reported to be 2%-5% present in general population (Levine et al. 2002). One of the most prominent feature of APS is Central Nervous System involvement (Hughes 2003, Sanna et al. 2003). Either thrombotic or nonthrombotic neurological symptoms can be associated with APS. Stroke and migrane are the most common clinical features and are seen 20% of the patients. Epilepsy, dementia, chorea, multiple sclerosis-like syndromes, Guillain-Barre-like syndrome and sensorineuronal hearing loss have also been reported associated with APS (Sanna et al. 2003). Some psychiatric disorders/symptoms clusters like depression, anxiety, and psychosis have been reported in association with APS. In addition, increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticogulants have been reported in untreated psychotic patients (Schwartz et al. 1998). The presenting symptoms of APS can also be psychotic symtoms, and the somatic symptoms may appear later (Kurtz & Multer 1994). Raza et al. (2008) have also reported manic disorder as a psychiatric manifestation of AFS. In addition, Del Rio-Casanova et al. (2014) have reported psychosis as debut of antiphospholopid syndrome. However, the precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between APS and psychosis have not been identified yet. The circulating antibodies or the thrombotic events may be the key pathological feature. We aimed to discuss the possible association between APS and psychosis with a case report. CASE REPORT",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

A longitudinal epidemiologic study in Switzerland (the Zurich Study) identified brief, but recurrent, episodes of depression with severity of symptoms, impairment, and distress equivalent to major depression. The concept of recurrent brief depression was further confirmed in recent community and general practice studies. The diagnostic criteria for recurrent brief depression require the presence of at least five of nine depressive symptoms analogous to the symptoms of major depression, yet a duration of less than 2 weeks (in general 1 to 3 days), a recurrence of at least 12 times a year, and the evidence of work impairment. The 1-year prevalence in the general population is about 5% and the lifetime prevalence 16%. Recurrent brief depression may develop into major depression and vice versa in about the same percentage of cases. It is associated with considerable suicidality and treatment-seeking and is comorbid with anxiety disorders. Patients with combined major and recurrent brief depression are more severely affected, have a higher suicide attempt rate, and have an increased frequency of treatment-seeking than patients with only one condition. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate treatment strategies.",

The main objectives of pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder are to: (i) treat the acute mania or hypomania, using drugs such as lithium salts, anticonvulsants (valproate, carba-mazepine, lamotrigine), antipsychotics (asenapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole) and the benzodiazepines (clonazepam, lorazepam); (ii) treat the bipolar depression, using drugs such as antidepressants, lithium salts, antipsychotics (quetiapine) and anticonvulsants (lamotrigine); and (iii) prevent the occurrence of recurrent episodes or relapse (prophylaxis) by using 'mood stabilizers' such as lithium salts, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, valproate) and antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine). Hypomania is a milder form of mania, which is not severe enough to cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning, is not accompanied by psychotic features and does not require hospitalization. BD is a complex and multifaceted illness and its characteristics can change from episode to episode, making treatment problematic.",

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

      "abstract": "Shock is a pathological state in which there is an insufficiency in oxygen supply and demand. Ultimately, it results in global hypoperfusion and a resulting increase in anaerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis. Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in the critical care setting is of primary importance in the management of a critically ill patient. When oxygen supply is inadequate, the body undergoes several physiological changes to maintain the oxygen delivery requirements and perfusion pressure. This stage is referred to as compensated shock, and early signs of shock may be appreciated during this stage. When compensatory mechanisms are inadequate and DO2 begins to fall beyond the critical point, shock has progressed to the uncompensated stage. During this stage, there is rapid deterioration of the patient due to prolonged hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is the development of potentially reversible physiological derangement involving two or more organ systems not involved in the causative disorder, which results in persisting states of shock, sepsis and hypoperfusion and a major cause of high mortality in the intensive care unit reaching a range of 11–54% in septic pediatric patients. The final stage of shock is irreversible shock, which is also referred to as refractory shock. This final stage of shock carries a 96–99% mortality rate.",

Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms.

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Within the field of real alcoholic epilepsy two forms can be distinguished. One is generally reversible and arises 5-10 years following the start of the alcohol habis, the other tardive, starting years later irreversible).

As the pathology becomes more and more complicated, the psychosocial stresses, mood disturbance, and physiological dysfunction become more significant. Thus, the pathology falls into a vicious circle. Patients with FSS have common problems or characteristics, and have several overlapped diagnoses. FSS should be treated from aspects of both the similarity and the difference.",

In the absence of depressive symptoms, the psychological organization of pain can be understood as a substitution. Such a situation leads to a \"stabilization\" of the symptom and more prolonged chronicity than when depression presents at the same time, since in these patients, referral for psychotherapy is delayed.",

This disorder is diagnosed when two of the following features occur: unilateral headache, throbbing pain, the pain worsening with activity, moderate or severe pain intensity, and at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Cluster headaches are one of a group of rare disorders known as trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of recurring headache. It's not a vascular headache or a migraine. The mean age of onset is during the second decade of life. Usually mild to moderate bilateral headaches with a feeling of tight bands or pressure around the head.",

One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is a serious epileptic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It can be divided into four stages: &nbsp;developing (seizures leading up to status epilepticus), established (&gt;5 minutes convulsive status epilepticus, nonconvulsive/focal status epilepticus &gt;10 min), refractory (failure of two adequately dosed antiseizure medications in different drug classes), and super-refractory (persisting despite &gt;24 hours of anesthesia). All seizure types can develop to status epilepticus. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus &nbsp;has the largest potential for brain damage. The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern.Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

In der psychiatrischen Epidemiologie hingegen existieren nur ganz wenige longitudinale Studien. In diesem Artikel werden einige Ergebnisse einer solchen, der «Zürich Studie», zu Zwangsstörungen zusammengefasst. Es fand sich eine hohe Prävalenz von Zwangsstörungen entsprechend DSM-5-Kriterien, der Verlauf war häufig chronisch, aber langfristig war die Remissionsrate mit fast 60% höher als bisher angenommen. In Bezug auf die Komorbidität fanden sich generell hohe Raten an komorbiden Störungen und ein besonders enger Zusammenhang mit der sozialen Phobie.",

The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder.

This study examined 79 nondepressive psychotics within 2 years of onset of illness, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria and assessed for negative symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Marked negative symptoms were observed in nearly half of patients diagnosed as suffering definite schizophrenia and were rarely found in other psychoses. Negative symptoms were not significantly correlated with positive symptoms, depression or exposure to neuroleptics, but were correlated with developing extrapyramidal side effects.",

In the new classification system DSM-III-R the concept of dysthymia is more clearly defined and delimited. It is there defined as a chronic mood disorder, particularly characteristic in cases with an early onset. Coexisting personality disturbance is relatively common. Dysthymia is a common kind of mood disorder. Often the symptoms are heterogeneous. In about one-third of the cases there are superimposed episodes of major depression, called double depression. As a result of the chronic course of dysthymia, dependence on alcohol or other substances is common. Double depression is relatively well suited to antidepressive treatment, whereas “pure” dysthymias, the mildest case in particular, show little response to antidepressant drugs. The concept of reactive depression is discussed. In DSM-III-R this is at present not included under mood disorders (but is found under adjustment disorders).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A person with schizophrenia is more prone to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) when compared to the general population. Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.",

Penduduk yang mengalami gangguan jiwa skizofrenia mulai muncul pada usia sekitar 15 - 35 tahun. Penderita skizofrenia dengan gejala - gejala yang serius dan pola perjalanan penyakit yang kronis dapat berakibat disabilitas. Gejala skizofrenia meliputi gejala negatif dan gejala positif. Gejala negatif yaitu tidak ada atau kehilangan dorongan atau kehendak serta menarik diri. Sedangkan gejala positif yaitu halusinasi, waham, perilaku yang aneh dan pikiran yang tidak terorganisir (Videbeck, 2009). \r\nHalusinasi merupakan bentuk gangguan persepsi dimana individu mengalami kehilangan kemampuan dalam membedakan rangsangan internal (pikiran) dan rangsangan eksternal (dunia luar). Klien dengan diagnosa skizofrenia, 70% mengalami halusinasi dan 30% mengalami waham. Dari klien yang mengalami waham ditemukan 35%-nya mengalami halusinasi. Klien skizofrenia dan psikotik lain, 20% mengalami campuran halusinasi pendengaran dan pengelihatan (Stuart & Sundeen, 1995).\r\nDilihat dari gejala tersebut, halusinasi merupakan gejala yang paling banyak ditemukan.

Transit syndrome due to brain trauma is not treated, instead clinicians simply wait for it to pass, whereas delirium is a pathological condition that can be dealt with by stabilizing the general condition, and it is therefore important to identify. After brain trauma, transit syndrome may occur during the acute to subacute phase when consciousness disorder improves. If the patient is difficult to control, it is recommended that treatment be performed in cooperation with a psychiatrist. For agitation caused by brain trauma, administration of mood stabilizers(valproic acid, carbamazepine)and Chinese herbs(yokukansan)may be considered. For depressive symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, irritability, etc., administration of SSRI as an antidepressant may be considered. Antipsychotics may be considered if antidepressants or mood stabilizers are ineffective against agitation, or if the patient experiences schizophrenia-like symptoms such as delusions.",

      "title": "A Patient with Chronic Schizophrenia Presenting with Multiple Deliberate Self-Harm and Genital Self-Mutilation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with severe psychiatric illnesses have a greater risk of suicide compared to the general population. (1) Suicide is the major cause of mortality in schizophrenia, (2) and deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a strong predictor of suicide in schizophrenia. (3) Deliberate self-harm is prevalent among patients with schizophrenia. One study reported a rate as high as 48% over a follow-up period of 14 to 17 years. (4) Five characteristics are considered significant predictors of DSH in schizophrenia: past or recent suicidal ideation, a history of DSH, a past depressive episode, drug abuse or dependence, and a higher number of psychiatric admissions. (4) Social and environmental factors, such as being married, (5) lack of stimulation and interaction with others have also been identified as risk factors for DSH. Deliberate self-harm can be extremely harmful and can lead to permanent damage that affects daily functioning; 2 examples are self-inflicted eye injuries, (6) such as enucleation, and genital self-mutilation, such as autocastration. (7) We report a Chinese patient with schizophrenia with repeated self-harm, including genital self-mutilation. This is an illustrative case demonstrating the risk factors for DSH, also prompting thought about the phenomenon of hypoalgesia. Case Report Mr. A, a 49-year-old Chinese man, had his first episode of DSH in 1992, 2 years after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Mr. A was born in Hong Kong, the youngest of 8 siblings. His eldest brother suffered from a psychiatric disorder--the exact nature of which could not be identified--and died in his 40s of unknown causes. Mr. A studied up to Form 1 then quit school due to poor academic results. He worked in factories and, more recently, as a cleaner. He had no history of substance abuse but had been smoking for 20 years. He married when he was 28 years old and had 2 sons. His wife left him 10 years ago, taking the 2 sons with her, following a quarrel over Mr. A's gambling on horse racing. They have had no contact since then. Mr. A moved to live with his father, with whom he felt he had a close relationship. After his father's death 2 years ago, he lived alone in a flat. He was described as quiet and introverted. Mr. A led a solitary life, enjoyed music and horse betting. Mr. A became known to the mental health service in 1990 when he started attending an outpatient psychiatric clinic for 2 episodes of psychotic symptoms. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward a year later for attacking 2 passers-by in the street as he felt they were talking about him. Prior to that incident, he had failed to attend his outpatient appointments and stopped taking his medications. He believed a computer located in the factory at which he had previously worked was producing itchiness, movements of his mouth, and pornographic ideas in his mind. After admission, he was prescribed with haloperidol and fluphenazine depot injections. His psychotic symptoms resolved. In 1992, Mr. A was admitted again, after he amputated his left index finger. One week prior to this event, he heard his thoughts being echoed as fragments of sentences. On the night of the amputation, he suddenly realised that someone wanted to harm his elder son while he was washing the dishes in the kitchen. Believing that he could prevent this by chopping off his left index finger, he acted on the idea immediately. He was fully conscious and did not experience any pain. His wife promptly called an ambulance. After an emergency operation, he was transferred to the psychiatric ward, when he reported hearing voices talking to each other. One voice told him that the reason for his finger-amputation was to release various gods and fairies to save the world. He believed the voices were from a traditional Chinese god and a devil, Kwun Yam and Tin Gau respectively. He had no regret about his act. He was transferred to a psychiatric unit after stabilisation of his physical condition. …",

      "abstract": "As effects of excitement may be noted—( a ) those which are transitory, occurring during the excitement, and (b) those which persist. As transitory effects there may be an apparently general hypermnesia, in which there is a marked freshening of all memories, or there may be a selective hypermnesia, where certain rather narrow lines of association are followed. The lasting effects may be hypermnesia, hypomnesia, or total amnesia for events experienced during the excitement. The following lasting effects may also be noted upon experiences that have occurred before the emotion: (1) The well-known retro-active amnesia; (2) The opposite, retro-active hypermnesia to which little attention has formerly been paid; (3) a combination of both these effects; for the same person the stretch preceding the critical event may show vivid recollections followed by a period of utter blank. The retro-active hypermnesia in the author's cases rarely goes beyond the events of the day preceding the excitement. It occurred in 25 out of 225 cases. The antecedent events are unusually vivid—more vivid than any other of the patients' memories. The vividness is not confined to visual images, although these are more frequent; sounds, the mood, the general state of the mind may be clearly represented. There is some indication that women experience it more frequently than men. In some cases the effect has come at some crisis at early childhood, in others at a later date. The quality of the emotion seems of less importance than the intensity of the shock. Fear, or fearless surprise, or pleasurable surprise may be the cause. If the intensity be exceeded the experiences connected with it are in some degree suppressed; while if it be not reached the experiences are lost probably by a mere failure to gather up the events into the mesh of interest. Emotion facilitates the recall of whatever is noticed during the excitement, and it seems probable that memory images may be treated by the emotional onrush in the same way as perceptive images. The experiences of the preceding day, however, probably do not exist as actual images at the time of the emotion but as psycho-physical dispositions or traces, so that where there is retro-active hypermnesia the emotion would seem to have the power to strengthen these dispositions and the connections by which they may be called into life. The author gives illustrative cases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis is a severe, acute or chronic mental illness that is characterized by reality distortion, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, catatonia, and impaired insight. Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "Depresija je cesto nedijagnosticirana i nelijecena u starijih osoba cemu pridonosi mit da je depresivnost uobicajena u osoba starije životne dobi i prirodna reakcija na promjene koje starija životna dob nosi.Uz uobicajene simptome depresije prema MKB-10 Međunarodnoj klasifikaciji bolesti i srodnih zdravstvenih problema, kod osoba starije životne dobi postoje specificni dodatni simptomi: a) pritužbe na bolove, umor, gubitak apetita, poteskoce usnivanja i prosnivanja, tjeskoba, palpitacije ; b) razdražljivost, promjene raspoloženja, konstantne pritužbe, nista sto se ucini za osobu nije dovoljno dobro ; c) poteskoce u koncentraciji i pamcenju, pretjeran osjecaj tuge, nemogucnost uživanja u ranijim aktivnostima i d) pricanje o beskorisnosti ne vrijedi vise nikome. U klinickoj slici u starijih osoba u odnosu na mlađe cesce su prisutni: agitacija, psihomotorna retardacija, hipohondrijaza/somatizacije, histrionsko ponasanje, bitno smanjenje unosa hrane i tekucine te pseudodemencija. Dijagnosticki postupci obuhvacaju obavezno uz anamnezu i heteroanamnezu, MMSE, tjelesni pregled, EKG, laboratorijske pretrage + dodatne dijagnosticke pretrage - određivanje vitamina BI 2, folne kiseline, Fe, hormona stitnjace, EEG te CT/MR mozga. Terapijske preporuke: Lijecenje treba zapoceti niskom dozom (pola pocetne doze u odraslih osoba) i polagano titrirati. Lijek prvog izbora je iz skupine SIPPS jer ga starije osobe dobro podnose, a dokazana im je ucinkovitost kod depresija u osoba starije životne dobi. Ako uz maksimalnu dozu ne dođe do zadovoljavajuceg poboljsanja, potrebno je promijeniti lijek unutar skupine SIPPS-a. Sljedeci je korak promjena lijeka u antidepresiv iz skupine inhibitora ponovne pohrane serotonina i noradrenalina. U slucaju rezistencije i kžd prisutnih psihoticnih simptoma dodaju se antipsihotik i stabilizator ri%položenja. Kod jetrenih ostecenja biramo tianeptin i mirzaten. Kod izrazito suicidalnih pacijenta može se dodati klozapin u vrlo niskoj dozi od 6, 25 mg u vecernjoj dozi. Pocetne doze i raspon doza antidepresiva u starijih osoba iznosi Vl- Vi doze za mlade odrasle osobe. Prikaz slucaja: Bolesnica u dobi 76 godina, lijecena u sedam navrata u KB Vrapce pod dijagnozama granicnog poremecaja licnosti, vaskularnedemencijenakonpreboljelog CVI-a i vaskularne depresije. Sklona je dramaticnim demonstrativnim ispadima, somatizacijama i manipulativnom parasuicidalno'm ponasanju. Inace osjetljiva je na psihofarmake zbog vaskularnog parkinsonizma. Znacajno je da unatoc poboljsanju raspoloženja zbog primijenjene diferentne antidepresivne terapije (duloksetinom i mirzatenom) pacijenticu nije bilo moguce otpustiti iz bolnice, a da u vrlo kratkom periodu ne uslijedi rehospitalizacija zbog manipulativnog parasuicidalnog ponasanja zbog nezadovoljstva smjestajem. Ishod i tijek samog lijecenja vaskularne depresije kod ove pacijentice određuje i otežava ipak primarni poremecaj u strukturi licnosti uz pocetnu vaskularnu demenciju, a izbor antidepresiva ogranicava vaskularni parkinsonizam.",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome with a combination of aripiprazole and fluoxetine: a case report",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "Overview of Psychiatric Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of psychiatric symptoms and syndromes that can be seen with neurologic diseases. Our goal is not to discuss every psychiatric disorder that might occur but to focus on those that are the most common. Important characteristics of this condition include: • Intermittently sad mood • Identifiable precipitant • Absence of major depression Just as grief is a normal response to loss, demoralization is a normal response to adversity. When bad things happen, our spirits fall. Because adversity is common with neurologic diseases, so is demoralization. Thus, patients may become demoralized when they learn they have a neurologic disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease), when they experience the symptoms of such a disease (eg, blindness, aphasia, pain), or when they develop the side effects of treatment for the disease (eg, weight gain from prednisone, dyskinesias from levodopa). Demoralization is not linked to any particular group of neurologic diseases, but it tends to be more common in those that are chronic, progressive, painful, debilitating, or disfiguring. Demoralized patients are almost always sad, but they may also be frustrated, irritable, pessimistic, or anxious. These unpleasant emotions are directly related to the patient’s situation and diminish as that situation improves. Someone who is demoralized by pain cheers up when the pain is relieved. Even when patients are demoralized by circumstances that cannot be reversed, their mood often improves when they discover that they are not powerless in the face of adversity. In this way, patients who become demoralized when they are told that they have a terminal illness may feel better as they start to focus on what they can do with the time left to them, and patients who become demoralized by the onset of a paraplegia may brighten as they begin to make progress in rehabilitation. This direct relationship between the patient’s mood and his or her situation helps distinguish the sadness of demoralization from that of major depression, because in the latter condition the patient’s mood remains low despite improving circumstances. Other features of a demoralized state also help differentiate demoralization from major depression.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome complicating acute and chronic liver failure and characterized by a wide range of manifestations, in absence of other brain disease. HE is very frequent in course of cirrhosis and even mild forms involve a great additional burden on patients, their families and health-care resources. Its onset affects subsequent survival of patients. Historically, pathophysiology of HE was connected to several substances (mostly ammonia) produced in the gut and normally metabolized by the liver, but more recently other factors such as inflammation, bacterial translocation and oxidative stress have shown a crucial role. Symptoms are often overt (confusion, asterixis, disorientation, ataxia or coma) but can also be subtle (sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, mood alterations, impairment of executive decision-making, and psychomotor speed – Minimal HE); the West Haven Criteria are most often used to grade Overt HE (OHE), with grade ranging from 0 to 4 (4 corresponding to coma). Since both Minimal HE and grade 1 HE cannot be diagnosed by clinical examination and need for specific tests, it results practical to combine these entities and name them \"Covert\" HE (CHE) to aid clinical use. Diagnosis is based on evidence of neurological impairment in presence of liver cirrhosis, only after the exclusion of other brain diseases. Measurement of serum ammonia and electroencephalography are little specific, while brain magnetic resonance and search for portosystemic shunts are important in complex cases. Diagnosis of OHE is often just clinical, while that of CHE requires dedicated psychometric and neurophysiological tests. Although these tests are difficult to be performed in the clinical practice, detection and treatment of CHE are cost-effective and important; indeed, CHE affects patients’ quality of life, socioeconomic status and driving skills, and increases the risk for falls, car accidents, development of OHE, and death. Management of HE includes early diagnosis and prompt treatment of precipitating factors (infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, hypotension, use of benzodiazepines, psychoactive drugs, and/or alcohol). Current treatment is based principally on reducing intestinal ammonia with nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose or lactitol); rifaximin, used solely or in addition, is also becoming a first-line treatment.",

The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

      "title": "KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS IN COMMUNITY AMONG THE ASHA WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Mental health' and 'mental illness' are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. Amental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples' lives in different ways. Just as it's possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it's entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That's because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times ('episodes') of ill health and times of better or good health. With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they dene well—and nd meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals. Objectives 1.To identify the knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness in community among the ASHAworkers in Kasaba Bawada, Kolhapur. Methodolgy: A non-experimental descriptive survey design was used for the study. Non probability purposive sampling technique was used to select 60 samples. Data collection was done using structured knowledge questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using descriptive (mean, S.D, Frequency and Percentage). The majority of the workers 40 (66.67%) belonged to the age group 31-40 years and minimum 08 (13.33%) workers belong to age group 41-50 years. The maximum of the workers 54 (90.00%) belonged to Hindu religion, and the remaining 6(10.00%) belonged to Muslim and Other religion. Maximum workers 56(93.34%) were married, and remaining 4 (6.66%) were widowed. Majority of the workers 28 (46.66%) studied till SSC and minimum 2 (3.34%) studied till graduation. Maximum 46 (76%) workers have poor knowledge and 13 (22%) have average knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness. Conclusion:The project work concludes that maximum workers have poor knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness, so there is need to focus on awareness of mental health among all the ASHAworkers.",

Alcoholic (ethanol) amblyopia with such features as slow gradient visual acuity decrease in both eyes (although visual acuity can decrease down do a very low grade, the complete blindness is rare) is among the disorders in patients with chronic alcoholism. Fundus of the eye at the beginning of the disease is normal in most of the cases, sometimes an optic nerve congestion and mild features of optic neuritis can be observed. Sometimes optic nerve hyperemia or anemia can be observed. Simple optic nerve atrophy seen as the temporal parts or the entire disc blanching can be seen at the late stages. Alcohol toxicity can also result as peripheral vision decrease, with degree of it increasing depending on the clinical manifestations of the alcoholism. Generally, eye disorders in patients with chronic alcoholism in most of the cases manifest as central retinal area damage and combination of retinal and optic nerve involvement.",

Tidak seperti tipe skizofrenia lainnya (hebefrenik, paranoid, dan katatonik), skizofrenia simpleks sulit ditemukan dan ditentukan diagnosisnya. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V menghapus diagnosis untuk skizofrenia simpleks, namun dalam Pedoman Penggolongan Diagnostik Gangguan Jiwa (PPDGJ) III dan International and Classification Diseases (ICD)-10 masih disertakan. Studi kasus ini membahas pasien yang didiagnosis skizofrenia simpleks dengan diagnosis pembandingnya episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik. Seorang laki-laki bernama AY, berusia 28 tahun, dan tidak tamat sekolah dasar tidak memiliki figur ayah. Klien AY pernah bekerja secara wajar serta menyukai lawan jenis. Kemunduran fungsi psikologis kemudian terjadi. Simtom negatif dari skizofrenia pada AY sangat menonjol, yaitu sedikit berbicara, afek datar, menarik diri dari pergaulan sosial, minat dan ambisi kurang, dan dorongan vitalitas rendah. AY memiliki ide atau pikiran-pikiran bahwa dirinya bersalah, berdosa, dan memandang sesuatu tampak kotor sehingga terdapat perilaku mencuci yang berulang-ulang. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menjukkan tanda-tanda patologis, yaitu depresi, cemas berlebihan, dan gangguan afek. Dinamika psikologi AY menunjukkan beberapa pengalaman traumatik pada masa kecil yang direpres. Konflik yang berkembang dengan ibu sehingga menghasilkan kompleks antara ego alien dengan ego. Kata kunci: skizofrenia simpleks, simtom negatif, diagnosis, ego ABSTRACT Simple Schizophrenia is an unusual type of schizophrenia characterized by slow, progressive development of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inability to meet community demands, and overall performance degradation. Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

      "abstract": "A fibromialgia (FM) e uma condicao em que ha presenca de dor cronica, caracterizada por fadiga, disturbios do sono e sintomas cognitivos, como ansiedade e depressao1. Dentre esse quadro clinico, destaca-se a dor cronica, como caracteristica mais marcante, podendo levar a incapacidades laborais e declinio na qualidade de vida.\r\nA fisiopatologia da FM ainda e desconhecida, mas acredita-se que existe uma alteracao no mecanismo central de controle da dor, o qual poderia resultar de uma disfuncao dos neurotransmissores2. Assim, essa disfuncao acarretaria uma deficiencia no sistema de neurotransmissores inibitorios em niveis espinhais ou supraespinhais (serotonina, encefalina e noradrenalina), ou uma hiperatividade de neurotransmissores excitatorios (substância P, glutamato e bradicinina)3.\r\nAtraves da analise dos registros do eletroencefalograma (EEG), pode-se observar nas areas envolvidas no processamento da dor, uma hiperexcitabilidade representando um mecanismo importante na manutencao deste sintoma na FM1.

      "abstract": "Ayurveda “Science of life” is a unique combination of science and philosophy that balances the holistic aspects of health i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Its aim is to promote and preserve physical and mental health and cure of ailments too. In order to lead a good quality of life both physical and mental health of a person should be maintained in good conditions. Now a days, even people know the importance of mental health as due to their busy lifestyle usually they succumb to unhealthy lifestyle which later pose harm to their health. Due to extreme stress in life people are becoming susceptible to various mental and lifestyle health issues like anxiety, depression, HTN, Diabetes and insomnia. Insomnia is defined as a condition where a person is unable to sleep or does not have a sound and sufficient sleep and wakes up usually tired and exhausted. The general causes of insomnia include stressful lifestyle, environmental influence, mental tension, changed food habits or any mental trauma. It is generally of two types: acute insomnia and chronic insomnia. The acute insomnia is referred to a condition one with short duration of few days to few weeks and the second chronic insomnia is which lasts for longer duration of few months to even years. Some of the major symptoms of insomnia include: difficulty in falling asleep at night, sleeplessness, waking up abruptly while sleeping and then not being able to fall asleep again, waking up tired and exhausted, irritability, sometimes wake up with headache, less concentration and low mood throughout the day, over thinking and worry related to sleep. There are various treatments available for this ailment in the form of oral medicines and therapies. In Ayurvedic treatment for insomnia some therapies such as Shirodhara and herbal medicines like Brahmi, Ashwagandha, Sarpgandha are known to produce calming and relaxing effect and result in sound and good sleep. This paper aims to compile and review the classical literature regarding management of Anidra; scientifically reported classical and non-classical sedative herbs; and clinical trials conducted on Anidra.",

Three clinical \"folie du doute\" variants were distinguished: \"repeated control\" obsessions (doubts are realized by re-control of the actions committed); obsessive doubts defined by contrastive ideas of expedience for choosing the approach contrastive to the taken decision; anxious ruminations (lack of assurance in the past actions and obsessive doubts of the variants supposed-to-be). \"Folie du doute\" emerged in different psychic disorders, the first variant manifesting in the scope of neurotic-like schizophrenia; the second one--in psychogenic states or psychogenically-provoked exacerbations of psychopathic-like schizophrenia; the third one being regarded in the structure of cyclothymiac's depressive phases.

Suite a une evaluation psychopathologique, nous avons mis en evidence un profil particulier chez des sujets seropositifs, il s'agit d'un deficit emotionnel, observable deja pendant le stade asymptomatique et qui semble evoluer avec la progression du virus dans l'organisme. Ce deficit consiste en un trouble quantitatif deficitaire de l'emotion associant une diminution de l'expressivite emotionnelle mimique, gestuelle et verbale et une diminution des eprouves avec une incapacite a prendre du plasir. Ce deficit emotionnel est present en l'absence de toute symptomatologie depressive ou anxieuse, d'ailleurs les sujets seropositifs asymptomatiques ne sont ni plus deprimes, ni plus anxieux que des controles seronegatifs issus de la meme population a risque. Des mesures electrophysiologiques de potentiels evoques cognitifs montrent, d'une part que ce deficit est correle a la diminution de l'amplitude de la p300 et d'autre part qu'il existe des atteintes cognitives precoces chez ces sujets seropositifs. Chez les patients atteints d'une demence de type alzeimer, nous avons egalement observe un deficit emotionnel deja present chez les sujets avec une deterioration legere qui augmente avec la deterioration. Ce deficit emotionnel ou emoussement affectif peut etre considere comme un processus adaptatif que le sujet adopte pour se proteger contre l'angoisse et la peur de se savoir atteint d'une maladie chronique, de voir progressivement ses capacites physiques et psychiques ainsi que son autonomie diminuer. Le sujet tente de s'economiser et on assiste a un retrait affectif mais aussi social",

Psychological interventions may explicitly target risk factors for poor outcome, such as substance use, or protective factors, such as adherence to medication, or be directed at specific symptoms or deficits. There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment. Many trials of psychological treatments have design flaws and this tends to overestimate the treatment effect.",

      "abstract": "El deficit de control inhibitorio es un problema social y de salud con un impacto economico sustancial y complejas implicaciones de diagnostico. Las fallas en el control inhibitorio a menudo resultan en consecuencias no deseadas para el individuo, generalmente expresadas en terminos de compulsividad y / o impulsividad. La compulsividad es una caracteristica central en el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC) y tambien comorbida en varios trastornos neuropsiquiatricos, como la esquizofrenia, el autismo y la adiccion. Este comportamiento se define como la perseverancia de una respuesta irresistible e inapropiada para el individuo e inevitable a pesar de sus consecuencias negativas. Por otro lado, la impulsividad incluye acciones mal concebidas, prematuramente expresadas, excesivamente arriesgadas o inapropiadas para la situacion, y es un componente clave en todos los trastornos neuropsicopatologicos diferentes, incluido el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH), el autismo y la esquizofrenia. Sin embargo, ambos constructos tienen un posible significado de diagnostico cruzado, aplicandolos a comorbilidades y puntos en comun en una variedad de trastornos. Estudios preclinicos y clinicos han demostrado la implicacion de los circuitos fronto-estriatal-limbicos en el deficit de control inhibitorio. Especificamente, el receptor serotoninergico 5-HT2A ha demostrado estar implicado en conductas impulsivas y compulsivas. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de la presente tesis fue, primero, estudiar el papel de los receptores 5-HT2A de la corteza prefrontal medial (mPFc) en la bebida compulsiva en la polidipsia inducida por programa (SIP). Para ello, realizamos microinfusiones intra-mPFc de DOI -agonista de 5-HT2A/C-, M100907 -antagonista de 5-HT2A- y SB242084 - antagonista de 5-HT2C-. La activacion de los receptores 5-HT2A/C dentro del mPFc dio como resultado una reduccion de la bebida compulsiva en ratas altas bebedoras (HD) seleccionadas por SIP, efecto que se bloqueo por la administracion conjunta de M100907 pero no de SB242084. Ademas, investigamos si las ratas altas y bajas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP mostraron diferencias basales en el “binding” del receptor 5-HT2A en estructuras cruciales para el control inhibitorio. Las ratas compulsivas HD menor “binding” en la amigdala basolateral (BLA) en comparacion con las bajas bebedoras (LD) seleccionadas por SIP. La plasticidad cerebral desadaptativa se ha relacionado con el deficit de control inhibitorio, subyacente a las diferencias individuales en cuanto a las conductas impulsivas o compulsivas en sujetos vulnerables. Por lo tanto, investigamos la morfologia de las estructuras cerebrales relacionadas con el control inhibitorio en animales altos y bajos compulsivos. Las ratas HD mostraron una disminucion del volumen del hipocampo y un aumento del volumen de BLA despues de la reexposicion SIP, comparadas con las HD no reexpuestas y la LD reexpuestas. La activacion inmune se ha propuesto como un factor crucial implicado en la vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio gracias a su estudio con modelos preclinicos. En el presente trabajo expusimos a los animales a Lipopolisacarido (LPS) y a antigeno de estreptococo del Grupo A (GAS) en etapas tempranas con el fin de estudiar con tareas conductuales especificas sus posibles efectos a largo plazo en relacion con el deficit de control inhibitorio. Ademas, exploramos si esta vulnerabilidad podria ser dinamitada por el estres y/o paliada por el tratamiento con antibiotico. Tambien evaluamos los efectos en biomarcadores inmunes cerebrales, como la interleucina-6 (IL-6), la interleucina-17 (IL-17) y el factor de necrosis tumoral α (TNFα). La exposicion a LPS aumento la compulsividad mediante respuestas perseverativas en “5-choice serial reaction time task” (5-CSRT task). La exposicion a GAS incremento el comportamiento impulsivo por respuestas prematuras en la tarea 5-CSRT en condiciones basales, y tanto la exposicion a GAS como la administracion del antibiotico ampicilina incrementaron el comportamiento impulsivo despues de aumentar el intervalo entre ensayos (ITI) de 5 a 7s. Por otra parte, la exposicion a GAS incremento la toma de decisiones impulsivas en “delay-discounting task”, efecto que fue revertido delay=20s por el tratamiento antibiotico. La exposicion a GAS disminuyo los niveles de IL-6 y aumento los niveles de TNFα en NAcc, y mostro un efecto combinado cuando se administro con el antibiotico disminuyendo los niveles de IL-17 en PFc. Hubo una correlacion positiva entre los niveles de TNFα en NAcc y en PFc con ambas medidas de impulsividad. La presente tesis refuerza la idea de la implicacion de los receptores 5-HT2A en el deficit de control inhibitorio; especificamente, su activacion dentro de mPFc redujo la compulsividad en ratas HD en SIP. Se reportan alteraciones morfologicas en hipocampo y amigdala en ratas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP, apuntando asi a cambios en la plasticidad cerebral como mecanismos subyacentes en trastornos psicopatologicos impulsivos-compulsivos. Ademas, la presente tesis muestra un papel putativo de la activacion inmune como factor de vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio a largo plazo.",

These disorders can appear without a context of histrionic personality. The evolution of hysterical disorders during life is not well known. First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly. The relation with the old hysteric subject must be marked by empathy and by the conviction that improvement will only lead back to a basal symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Partial remission from depression, with residual symptoms, is an important problem in depression. This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

      "abstract": "A first psychotic episode may be related to neurological diseases, especially encephalitis of infectious or autoimmune origin. It is remarkable that an immune-mediated encephalitis triggered by a confirmed subacute bacterial meningitis is documented, and this is the case we will present. A 22-year-old woman with no previous medical history, immunocompetent, with three months of behavioral, affective and cognitive symptoms with subsequent compromise of sensory perception and psychosis. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid showed inflammatory signs with positive FilmArray© for Streptococcus pneumoniae. She received anti-psychotic and antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks without clinical improvement. Postencephalitic syndrome with immune-mediated psychosis was considered as a diagnosis, and immunosuppressive management with corticosteroid and plasmapheresis was initiated with complete resolution of symptoms. After one year of follow-up no neurological relapse has been identified. Encephalitis is a neurological syndrome due to brain parenchymal damage that can result in psychiatric symptoms including psychosis and behavioral changes. Its causes are usually infectious (usually viral) or autoimmune (Anti NMDA, AMPA, LGI1 or others). A psychiatric condition in bacterial meningitis without improvement with antibiotic treatment is remarkable, its presence should suggest an immune-mediated post-infectious syndrome that may respond to the use of immunomodulators even in the absence of identification of autoimmune encephalitis-associated antibodies. No similar cases have been reported in the literature. Immune-mediated psychosis may be a manifestation of post-encephalitic syndrome associated with bacterial meningitis and its treatment with immunosuppressants may offer benefit in cases where the use of antipsychotics and antibiotics shows no improvement.",

      "title": "Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a condition in which affected individuals may experience paralytic episodes with concomitant hypokalemia (serum potassium Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. Additional triggers can include cold, stress/excitement/fear, salt intake, prolonged immobility, use of glucosteroids or alcohol, and anesthetic procedures. The age of onset of the first attack ranges from two to 30 years; the duration of paralytic episodes ranges from one to 72 hours with an average of nearly 24 hours. Long-lasting interictal muscle weakness may occur in some affected individuals and in some stages of the disease and in myopathic muscle changes. A myopathy may occur independent of paralytic symptoms and may be the sole manifestation of hypoPP. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypoPP is established in a proband who meets the consensus diagnostic criteria based on a history of attacks of muscle weakness associated with documented serum potassium In the case of long-lasting interictal flaccid muscle weakness, imaging techniques can inform on the pathogenesis, potential therapy, and prognosis. Muscle ultrasound and muscle 1H-MRI are reliable image techniques with high accuracy for the disease. The weakness can be caused by edemas, fatty muscle degeneration, and muscle atrophy or a combination of these pathologies. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment varies depending on the intensity and duration of the paralytic attack. Minor attacks may resolve spontaneously. Moderate attacks may be self-treated in a non-medical setting by ingestion of oral potassium salts. Severe attacks typically require more intensive medical management with intravenous potassium infusion, serial measurement of serum potassium concentration, clinical evaluation of possible respiratory involvement, and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. There is no known curative treatment for hypoPP-related myopathy; physiotherapy may help to maintain strength and motor skills. Prevention of primary manifestations. The goal of preventive treatment is to reduce the frequency and intensity of paralytic attacks. This may be achieved by avoidance of triggering factors, adherence to a diet low in sodium and carbohydrate and rich in potassium, and with the use of oral potassium supplementation. If dietary intervention and oral potassium supplementation are not effective in preventing attacks, treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) may be necessary. If carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not tolerated or not effective after prolonged use, alternatives include potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Prevention of secondary complications. Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical; an affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance and companions must be informed of the risk in order to enable rapid treatment. Anesthetic complications should be prevented by strict control of serum potassium concentration, avoidance of large glucose and salt load, maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance, and careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function. It is unknown whether prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with hypoPP who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported. Surveillance. The frequency of consultations is adapted to the individual's signs/symptoms and response to preventive treatment. Periodic neurologic examination with attention to muscle strength in the legs should be performed to detect long-lasting weakness associated with myopathy. For those taking acetazolamide, the following are indicated every three months: complete blood count; electrolytes; and glucose, uric acid, and liver enzyme levels. Renal ultrasound should be performed annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Factors that trigger paralytic attacks (e.g., unusually strenuous effort, carbohydrate-rich meals or sweets, cold, stress/excitement/fear, high salt intake, prolonged immobility, oral or intravenous glucosteroids, certain anesthetic procedures, alcohol) should be avoided when possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk. When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members can identify those at risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or possible anesthetic complications. Genetic counseling HypoPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with hypoPP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance is about 90% in males and reduced in females. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenien treten weltweit mit einer Lebenszeitprävalenz von etwa 1 % auf. Wieso ist eine teilweise erblich bedingte und oft schwer verlaufende Erkrankung so weit verbreitet und tritt relativ häufig auf? Eine mögliche Erklärung besagt, dass es neben den Krankheitssymptomen auch Auswirkungen der Disposition oder der Erkrankung selbst gibt, die sich - zumindest bei Familienangehörigen oder nur leicht Erkrankten - positiv auswirken. Ein möglicher Grund ist das Fehlen der latenten Inhibition bisher unwichtiger Reize bei schizophrenen Patienten: Wird in einer Versuchsanordnung eine Vielzahl von Reizen präsentiert, von denen aber nur ein einziger als Hinweisreiz fungiert, auf den reagiert werden muss, um eine Belohnung zu erzielen, filtern Gesunde die unwichtigen Reize schnell aus. Wechselt aber unangekündigt die Versuchsanordnung und ein bisher unwichtiger Reiz ist nun der Hinweisreiz, dann brauchen Gesunde meist recht lange, um den Reiz zu entdecken. Von latenter Inhibition wird gesprochen, weil Gesunde sehr viel länger brauchen, den Reiz zu entdecken, wenn er bereits vorhanden, aber bisher unwichtig war, als wenn er neu in der Situation auftritt. Die bisherige Bedeutungslosigkeit des Reizes „hemmt” also seine Wahrnehmung als Hinweisreiz. Anders ist dies bei schizophrenen Patienten: Sie hemmen die Wahrnehmung des bisher unwichtigen Reizes offenbar weniger effektiv, so dass sie ihn schneller erkennen können, wenn er beim Wechsel der Versuchsbedingungen zum Hinweisreiz wird. Zwar brauchen sie insgesamt oft deutlich länger als Gesunde, um die Versuchsanordnung zu bewältigen, gemessen an ihrer üblichen Reaktionszeit gelingt ihnen der Wechsel auf die neue Reizkonstellation aber schneller als den Gesunden [2]. Schizophrene Menschen können also in unüblichen oder neuartigen Situationen beobachten, dass ein vermeintlich wohl bekanntes Zeichen seine Bedeutung ändert und dies einen Hinweis auf das Verständnis der Situation geben könnte - vielleicht ein Grund dafür, dass psychotische Erfahrungen viele Künstler zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts stark beeinflusst haben, die die Situation des Menschen in der Industriegesellschaft neu verstehen wollten [3].",

Schizophrenia symptoms fall into six common symptom clusters: delusions and hallucinations, disorganization of speech, cognitive dysfunction, negative symptoms, affective symptoms, and motor system abnormalities. The diagnosis is based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, including exclusion of other possible medical or psychiatric etiologies of psychosis. The main goals during the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected schizophrenia are to rule out secondary etiologies of symptoms and to assess for significant comorbid conditions, balancing broad screening tests with the exclusion of specific disorders suggested by the presentation and history. After the initial evaluation, antipsychotic drug treatment should be initiated and consideration given to psychosocial treatments in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. Comanagement of the patient by a mental health subspecialist and a family physician is important to ensure appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management of common associated conditions.",

J, age 19, is a Division I collegiate volleyball player who recently sustained her third sport-related concussion (SRC).She has no psychiatric history but does have a history of migraine, and her headaches have worsened since the most recent SRC.She has a family history of depression (mother and her sole sibling).Ms. J recently experienced the loss of her coach, someone she greatly admired, in a motor vehicle accident.She is referred to outpatient psychiatry for assessment of mood symptoms that are persisting 1 month after the SRC.Upon assessment, she is found to meet 8 of the 9 criteria for a major depressive episode, including suicidality with vague plans but no intent to end her life.Although Ms. J does not have a history of psychiatric illness, her psychiatrist recognizes that she has factors that increase her risk of developing depression post-SRC, and of poor recovery from SRC.These include preexisting symptoms, such as her history of migraine, which is common in patients after SRC.Additionally, a family history of psychiatric disorders and high life stressors (eg, recent loss of her coach) are risk factors for a poor SRC recovery. 1Due to these risk factors and the severity of Ms. J's symptoms-which include suicidal ideation-the psychiatrist believes that her depressive symptoms might be unlikely to improve in the coming weeks, so he establishes a diagnosis of \"depressive disorder due to another medical condition (concussion)\" because the development of her depressive symptoms coincided with the SRC.If Ms. J had a pre-existing mood disorder, or if her depression had not developed until later in the postinjury period, it would have been more difficult to establish confidently that the depressive episode was a direct physiologic consequence of the SRC; if that had been the case, the diagnosis probably would have been unspecified or other specified depressive disorder.",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source.

Cameron<sup>2</sup>has designated these changes as \"impairment\" and \"disorganization,\" respectively. It may also be suggested that they are analogous in some respects to the negative and positive symptoms described by Hughlings Jackson<sup>3</sup>in neurological disease.

      "title": "Staging model in psychiatry: Review of the evolution of electroencephalography abnormalities in major psychiatric disorders",
      "abstract": "Aim Clinical staging in psychiatry aims to classify patients according to the severity of their symptoms, from stage 0 (increased risk, asymptomatic) to stage 4 (severe illness), enabling adapted treatment at each stage of the illness. The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event‐related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Im Anschluss an einen zahlenmaessigen Ueberblick ueber das Vorkommen der Alzheimer-Erkrankung in den Altersgruppen ab 65 Jahren in Deutschland werden die Auswirkungen der Alzheimer-Demenz (AD) auf die Fahrtauglichkeit diskutiert. Die Beeintraechtigungen der AD werden in die Auspraegungsgrade leicht, mittel und schwer unterschieden, denen eine Praedemenzphase von etwa fuenf bis sieben Jahren mit leichten, teils schwer erfassbaren kognitiven Beeintraechtigungen vorausgeht. Die Symptome bei fortschreitender Erkrankung werden im Einzelnen beschrieben. Bei mittleren und schweren Auspraegungsgraden sind die Betroffenen nicht mehr in der Lage, ein Fahrzeug sicher zu fuehren. In der Praedemenzphase und im Fruehstadium ist es fraglich, inwieweit und wie lange die Fahrfaehigkeit ohne erhoehtes Risiko erhalten bleibt. Der individuelle Krankheitsverlauf fuehrt dazu, dass die Fahreignung unterschiedlich lange erhalten bleibt. Nicht alleine die Leistungsdefizite sind entscheidend, sondern die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation und deren Aufrechterhaltung. Im Abschnitt ueber Rechtsvorschriften und Richtlinien werden die Begutachtungs-Leitlinien zur Kraftfahrereignung zitiert. Danach ist derjenige nicht in der Lage, ein Kraftfahrzeug zu fuehren, der unter einer ausgepraegten Demenz leidet. Dabei ist der Nachweis fuer ausgepraegte Leistungsmaengel unklar, da nicht sichergestellt ist, ob und wie lange Defizite kompensiert werden koennen. Die Leistungsueberpruefungen mittels neuropsychologischer Testungen korrelieren bei aelteren Menschen nur gering mit den Ergebnissen des praktischen Fahrverhaltens. In kritischen Faellen ist eine Fahrverhaltensprobe anzuraten, in der die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation erfasst wird, die entscheidend zur Erhaltung der Fahrfaehigkeit ist. Abschliessend wird ueber den derzeitigen Forschungsstand zur Fahreignung bei Patienten mit AD berichtet. Beitrag zum 3.

      "title": "Contribution of methotrexate in precipitation of manic episode in bipolar affective disorder explored: a case report",
      "abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of mania with or without, but commonly with, episodes of depression. It usually begins in adolescence and can cause enduring and substantial impairment if left untreated. It needs a long-term treatment with mood stabilizers to prevent relapses. Elevated or depressed mood relapses can be either primary or secondary. However, primary mood relapses can occur without a significant precipitating factor, more often tending to occur following stressful life events or discontinuation of mood stabilizer medications. Secondary mood relapses can be caused by many conditions, such as physical illnesses, substance misuse and medications. When a mental illness coexists with another physical illness and the treatment of one complicates the other, it adds complexity to the selection of appropriate pharmacological regime for either condition. In this paper, the authors present a case of bipolar affective disorder who had two episodes of mania likely precipitated by methotrexate, which were reversed by the withdrawal of the offending drug (methotrexate). To the best of the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no published reports in the literature in which methotrexate, an immunosuppressive and a cytotoxic drug, precipitated a manic episode in a patient with bipolar affective disorder.",

They present: a)viral etiology from: Epstein-Barr virus with pyscho-somatic substrate. b)Immune factors: inflammatory cytokine IL-1, T.N.F. alpha. c)Organic etiology: alteration of biochemical and morphological markers, metabolic oxidative stress. d)Psychological or traumatic stress : anxiety, reactive depression, panic attacks whiplash. e)Environmental factors : change in electromagnetic fields, geopathic stress, pesticide poisoning with multiple chemical syndrome, mercury poisoning. f)Dietary factors : presence of glutamate in food. g)Gulf war syndrome : 30% of soldiers develop P. F. S. MATERIAL and METHODS: The patient is evaluated from a psychological point of view (psychological trauma), associated with the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Naltrexone hydrocloride low dose and Cell Food-S-Adenosin Methionine. With additional therapies : Mineralogram , Chelation Therapy , Viral Seriology with Labò Live , Micro-immunotherapy (with homeopathic interleukin), Dr. Pierpaoli protocol with the use of vitamins A, D, E, C, Melatonin, Glutathione, Ubiquinone. Protocol: -Infiltration of the Trigger Points, mix of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) concentration 15-10 mcgrg/mL in cycles assessed with the Kinesiology Test (K.T.) -Minor Autohemotherapy (PAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Major Autohemotherapy (GAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Rectal insufflation (R.I.) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) From 1988 to 2017, I have treated 900 cases with this method, with the following results : significant symptom remission in the secondary form in around 60-70% of patients treated with infiltration of the Trigger Points and PAET. In more resistant cases, I have used homotoxicology, psychological counseling, Dr. Pierpaoli protocol and micro-immunotherapy RESULTS: These method results in good symptom remission in 50-60% of the cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: In the multi-factor genesis of PFS, an early diagnosis is important to prevent the pain occurring alongside psycho-somatic disturbances, which lead the subject into a reactive-depressive state. In the complex symptom variety, the obtained percentage results have improved with this additional method, as, by alleviating the symptoms, you assure a better quality of life for the patient.",

      "abstract": "The study included 60 patients aged 18-65 years with anxious-phobic disorder (APD)--agoraphobia with and without panic disorders. Diagnosis of the disease was performed according to ICD-10. It was established that dynamics and outcome of APD with stable agoraphobia depend on some comorbid psychic disorders (neurotic, nonpsychotic affective, personality disorders, slow-progredient schizophrenia). Influence of such disorders on APD depends on level of realization of the comorbid correlations: symptomatic (nondelirious hypochondria) and intersyndromal ones (affective and personal disorders as well as slow-progredient schizophrenia). Typology of APD with stable agoraphobia is proposed, that is determined by comorbid correlations with the phenomena of nondelirious (overvaluable or neurotic) hypochondria. Agoraphobia, comorbid with the phenomena of overvaluable hypochondria, is characterized by isolated phobic avoidance (1-2 situations), lack of the signs of progredience of psychopathologic disorders and relatively favourable outcome (lack of the cases of invalidism, decrease of a professional status in 8% of the patients). Agoraphobia, comorbid with the phenomena of neurotic hypochondria, is characterized by total phobic avoidance, syndromal comorbidity with polymorphic and generalized somatophormic disorders, depressive disorders syndromally completed, slow-progredient schizophrenia and less favourable outcome (avoidance behaviour of severe degrees was found in 57% of the patients, including 18% of patients disabled due to mental disease).",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

      "title": "Unusual Presentations of Epilepsies",
      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

The latter arise from disturbed electrical activity in the brain and take a variety of forms including episodes of disturbed movement, sensation, perception, and behavior, which are usually, but not inevitably, accompanied by alterations of the level of consciousness. Epilepsy is a relatively common disorder with a reported incideme of about 50 per 100,000 persons per year. The prevalence of active epilepsy is about 50 per 1000 persons, and it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the general population will suffer at least one nonfebrile seizure during their lives (Sander and Shorvon, 1987). Epilepsy is a heterogeneous condition varying considerably• with regard to severity, prognosis, and etiology. In about 60% to 70% of patients the condition remits. The remainder will continue to have seizures, although seizure frequency and severity will vary markedly among patients.",

      "title": "The influence of stress on the transition from drug use to addiction.",
      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

Depresi merupakan contoh manifestasi aspek psikis yang kerap dijumpai pada pasien penyakit dalam, dengan kekerapan yang bergantung pada karakteristik sosio-demografis dan durasi penyakit yang dialami.1 Kebanyakan penyakit di bidang ilmu penyakit dalam merupakan penyakit kronis. Sembuh terkadang bukanlah target yang diharapkan, namun keadaan terkontrolnya penyakit (yang dalam istilah medis disebut dengan remisi atau terkendali) sering merupakan target terapi yang ingin dicapai. Hal ini berimplikasi pada perlunya pemantauan dan pengobatan jangka panjang, bahkan pada beberapa kasus seumur hidup. Pada pasien penyakit kronis, depresi akan mempengaruhi cara pasien memandang dan menerima (cope) penyakit fisik yang dialami, serta menentukan bagaimana pasien berinteraksi dengan keluarga, dokter penyakit dalam, juga dengan pengobatan yang harus secara rutin dijalani pasien.",

      "title": "[Approach to the patient in vegetative state. Part II: differential diagnosis].",
      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Vital depersonalization was observed in 59 out of 76 schizophrenic patients with the prevalence of depersonalization. Three interrelated components of vital depersonalization were distinguished. The main depersonalization component proper was manifested by the experience of estrangement and unreality of the feeling of existence (\"self\"). The second, affective one, was marked by vital fear and anxiety. The third one involved common sense disorders and was characterized by vital bodily sensations. Vital depersonalization had all the principal signs of depersonalization. However, it differed from the allo-, somato- and autotypes of depersonalization in disorders of the vital level: similarity to physical sensations, pain and vagueness. Vital depersonalization may be viewed as pathology of the first level of selfawareness--selfsence of awareness of vital ego or of body perception.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s diseases, occuring most often between the ages of 50 and 60 years, on average at the age 58 years is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of global importance and serious consequences for public health. Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

Sleep, however, is a fragile state that can easily be impaired by psychological stress or physical illness. For up to 10% of the general population, difficulty falling and/or maintaining sleep occurs several times a week (i.e., chronic insomnia). Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

In many cases, patients have toxic abuse in some situations that could cause confusion in symptoms and ranking it. It is about a patient diagnosed 5 years ago of schizoaffective disorder with decompensation caused by leaving medication and drug consumption. A year ago, the treatment was changed to intramuscular formulation with abilify maintena to ensure compliance and adherence. The patient continues to consume toxic in weekends, with symptoms of self-referentiality and suspicion towards their environment. Two weeks ago, he was with the girlfriend of a friend and after this event, the friend has been threatening him. The patient has a state of anxiety rising, with interpretations and associations delirious about this friend. He sleeps with a knife in bed if the friend entered his home. It is a very overwhelmed situation, magnifying and causing severe impact on their underlying disorder. When the patient is evaluated, it is decided to add treatment with olanzapine a few days to reduce symptoms and anxiety. Patients with mental disorders have stressors that cause anxiety like a healthy patient. It is true that the impact it has on the patients tend to be older and to overvalue the signs and real situations. In these cases should not be considered a decompensation and attribute symptoms to lack of efficacy of treatment. In many cases, if we associate a more sedating antipsychotic profile, they shall reduce symptoms. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

Patients with apathy exhibit a marked decrease in goal-directed behavior, and the primary clinical feature is a lack of motivation accompanied by indifference, low social engagement, poor persistence, and a lack of initiation. Apathy is a syndrome that is distinct from depression. The cardinal symptoms of depression are pervasive feelings of sadness or anhedonia, accompanied by sleep and appetite changes, feelings of hopelessness, and guilt and suicidal ideation.

      "title": "Case Scenario: Opioid Association with Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "CHRONIC pain is a complex and subjective experience reflecting interactions of sensory, affective, cognitive, behavioral, and social factors.1The complexity of chronic pain necessitates multidimensional therapies; however, complex analgesic regimens pose risks for adverse drug interactions.1Analgesic regimens frequently include different classes of analgesics: nonopioids (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents), opioids, and/or adjuvants (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, etc. ). Effective and streamlined management of chronic pain is further confounded by associated comorbidities,2especially depression, which is present in more than 60% of chronic pain patients.1,2Medications modulating serotonergic pathways, such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. , amitriptyline, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g. , fluoxetine, citalopram), or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. , duloxetine, venlafaxine) are frequently used in the treatment of depression.2,3As a result, it is common for patients with chronic pain to be prescribed opioid analgesics along with antidepressant medications either for the analgesic and/or antidepressant effect.3Less common is the awareness that opioids may significantly affect serotonin kinetics in the presence of other serotonergic agents, causing increased intrasynaptic serotonin level.4The following case scenarios illustrate the concern of potential iatrogenic adverse interactions of serotonergic drugs with commonly prescribed opioids in chronic pain patients.SA was a 45-yr-old male with long-standing abdominal pain attributed to Crohn's disease, as well as low back and neck pain with associated insomnia and depression. For several years he maintained a stable regimen of 30 mg oral methadone three times a day, 60 mg duloxetine once a day, and 10 mg desipramine at bedtime.He presented to the pain clinic for an unscheduled follow-up per his request, with new complaints of increased tremulousness, fatigue, and weakness in the bilateral upper and lower extremities. He also reported worsening insomnia and anxiety over the past week. On history, he admitted to taking more than his prescribed dose of methadone during the last 2 weeks for acute, severe renal colic pain secondary to nephrolithiasis.On exam, SA was hypertensive, diaphoretic, and tremulous, and had stiff extremities with passive range of motion without clonus, as well as 3+ patella reflexes. This constellation of symptoms along with his history met the diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome. Subsequently, he was instructed to discontinue duloxetine and reduce his methadone to his prescribed dose. The low-dose desipramine was continued, as it had been effective in managing insomnia. Over the following 2 days, his symptoms resolved.RB was a 58-yr-old male with a long history of back pain following vertebral fractures sustained in a motor vehicle accident 40 yr ago. History revealed long-term stable doses of medications for management of his pain and depression. These included 75 μg per hour transdermal fentanyl patch replaced every 3 days, 5/325 mg oral oxycodone/acetaminophen twice daily, 200 mg celecoxib twice daily for pain, and 40 mg citalopram once daily and 50 mg mirtazapine at bedtime for depression. In addition, he was prescribed 4 mg doxazosin for benign prostatic hypertrophy and 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release at bedtime as needed for insomnia.Due to his complaint of inadequate pain control, RB's frequency for replacement of fentanyl patch was increased to 2 days rather than 3 days by his managing physician. A week after the increase in fentanyl, he developed anxiety, tremulousness, fever, and sweating. He was prescribed 0.2 mg oral clonidine every 4 h for management of anxiety, but this did not improve his symptoms by the next day. RB then decided to discontinue his fentanyl patch without informing his prescribing physician, as he believed the recent increase was the cause of his new symptoms.With persisting symptoms, RB presented to the emergency department the next day and was found to be hypertensive, tachycardic with heart rate in the low 100s, tachypneic with respiratory rate in the 20s, anxious, unable to stand still, and mildly confused. Laboratory, electrocardiogram, and drug screen were unremarkable. RB was treated with 5 mg haloperidol and 2 mg lorazepam for agitation and anxiety and discharged home (table 1).Continuing to have persistent symptoms, he returned to the emergency department later that night with new complaints of frequent yawning and insomnia. The emergency department physician suspected opioid withdrawal, given a negative urine drug screen for opiate metabolites. However, RB claimed that he took his oxycodone as prescribed. He was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of opioid withdrawal, so his fentanyl patch, which he removed 2 days prior, was reapplied. The admitting team then consulted the pain service for further management (table 1).Further questioning by the pain service revealed that RB had a similar, although less intense, presentation of symptoms shortly after initiating oxycodone. With regard to his current symptoms, an increase in replacement frequency of his fentanyl patch was the only recent change in his medication regimen. Based on current and past symptoms being preceded by opioid medication changes in the setting of other agents affecting the serotonin pathways, the pain service diagnosed RB with serotonin syndrome. Increased fentanyl was thought to be the precipitating factor, even though he had been without his fentanyl patch for 30 h, since peripheral stores of fentanyl are cleared slowly after discontinuation of a transcutaneous patch. After making the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, haloperidol, fentanyl patch, oxycodone/acetaminophen, citalopram, and mirtazapine were discontinued. RB had complete resolution of symptoms by the following day. For chronic pain, he was prescribed 45 mg extended-release oral morphine sulfate every 12 hours in place of the fentanyl patch, with reported good pain control and no recurrence of earlier symptoms on follow up. Since his depression had been stable on citalopram and mirtazapine before the recent increase in fentanyl, RB was discharged from the hospital with instructions to restart these antidepressants (table 1).Both of these cases highlight the limitations/complexities in the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. They expose the consequences of polypharmacy and limited knowledge of the interactions among prescribed medications. The lack of awareness among clinical practitioners led to a misdiagnosis/missed diagnosis on two occasions in case two. Mild symptoms, overlapping features between several syndromes, and limitations of clinical diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome are also other confounding factors in missed diagnosis. These two cases affirm that upon early and accurate diagnosis, discontinuation of suspicious offending agents leads to resolution of symptoms within 24 h.The symptoms of serotonin syndrome have a direct correlation with intrasynaptic serotonin level. Hence, choice of nonserotonergic medications, dose reduction, and discontinuation of the serotonergic agents will prevent recurrence of serotonin syndrome. In case one, decreasing the dose of methadone, and in case two, replacement of serotonergic opioids (oxycodone and fentanyl) by a nonserotonergic opioid (morphine) despite continuation of the other serotonergic agents (desipramine, mirtazapine), was helpful in managing the other symptoms. In both cases the serotonergic symptoms subsided shortly after these adjustments were made with no recurrence.Serotonin syndrome is a rare, but potentially life-threatening, iatrogenic complication4,6from therapeutic use or overdosage of serotonergic drugs alone or in combination via postsynaptic hyperstimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A and 1A serotonin receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system.6Serotonin syndrome presents as a constellation of symptoms including mental status changes, neuromuscular over-activity, and autonomic instability.6,7Serotonin syndrome was first described in the1950s as a drug interaction of iproniazid with pethidine, and it was soon discovered thereafter that serotonin excess was the causative factor.4,8The true incidence is likely underestimated because of unrecognized milder symptoms and overlapping symptoms with other diseases, making the diagnosis challenging.9,10,11The incidence of serotonin syndrome is reported to be 14–16% in patients who overdose with SSRIs alone.12However, the incidence of serotonin syndrome has been on the rise in the past 20 yr due to development of diagnostic criteria, wide usage of SSRIs, emergence of newer SSRIs, and polypharmacy.1,13Symptoms manifest predictably, with rising intrasynaptic serotonin concentration ranging from mild tremors and diarrhea to severe toxic symptoms such as hyperthermia and rigidity. Intentional misuse, overdosing, or concomitant use of multiple serotonergic drugs in therapeutic dosages may result in serotonin syndrome. Occasionally, monotherapy may also precipitate symptoms,12but most severe reactions are attributed to polypharmacy.Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system at the brainstem raphe nuclei and in the periphery within intestinal enterochromaffin cells and platelets.7It is generated by hydroxylation and decarboxylation of L-tryptophan.14Serotonin cannot cross the blood brain barrier but its precursor metabolites can.10,15Serotonin mediates excitatory neurotransmission through its action on the family of G protein-coupled/ligand-gated ion channel serotonin receptors, i.e. , 5-HT receptors.11,12There are seven main types of serotonin receptor (5-HT1to 5-HT7) with several subtypes described.14Centrally serotonin regulates wakefulness, affective behavior, core temperature, vomiting, eating behavior, and sexual behavior, and mediates nociception/analgesia. Peripherally, it modulates gastrointestinal motility and vasomotor function.7,12After serotonin release, postsynaptic vesicles reuptake serotonin and metabolize it to 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid via monoamine oxidase enzymatic action.14Pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome is complex. Excessive postsynaptic agonism of serotonergic receptors through increased intrasynaptic serotonin level or direct receptor stimulation resulting in increased postsynaptic excitatory neurotransmission at 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1Areceptors is responsible for the development of serotonin syndrome16(fig. 1). Intrasynaptic serotonin excess can result from its increased synthesis or release, as well as decreased reuptake or decreased metabolism.12,16There is an expanding list of agents through various mechanisms having potential to cause serotonin syndrome, as mentioned in figure 1. In addition to excessive 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1Apostsynaptic agonism,16there are several other factors predisposing serotonin syndrome, including: Despite a limited-yet-growing armamentarium of medications to treat pain conditions, opioids remain a mainstay of pain management. Opioids are commonly used analgesics prescribed in conjunction with other serotonergic medications, thus affecting the pharmacodyanamics of serotonin. In recent years, opioids have been recognized as serotonergic agents that have been associated with serotonin syndrome.4Proposed mechanisms for opioids' serotonergic action include both a weak serotonin reuptake inhibition6and an increased release of intrasynaptic serotonin through inhibition of γ-amino butyric acid-ergic presynaptic inhibitory neuron on serotonin neurons.3,10Synthetic piperidine opioids are considered proserotonergic and include fentanyl,17methadone,18meperidine,19propoxyphene, dextromethorphan,20and tramadol.21The phenantherene morphine analogues, i.e. , oxycodone,22hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and buprenorphine23do not act as serotonin uptake inhibitors,24but may increase the intrasynaptic serotonin levels either through increased release of neurotransmitter or some unknown mechanism.4,6,14The list of opioids implicated in causing serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic agents is growing (table 2).Oxycodone is a centrally acting synthetic morphine analog acting on μ and κ receptors to provide analgesia. It lacks serotonin uptake inhibition property24but may cause increased serotonin-like activity at the synaptic level by direct action on postsynaptic membranes mimicking serotonin activity, or may release serotonin through an unknown opioid-mediated release.24There are several case reports published in recent years showing synergism with other serotonergic agents to precipitate serotonin syndrome.Fentanyl is a synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid that binds with μ receptors to provide analgesia. It is a 5-HT1Aagonist, which augments serotonin release, and through weak serotonin reuptake inhibition, increases intrasynaptic serotonin levels.4There is no report of fentanyl causing serotonin syndrome as a sole agent; rather, it requires the additive action of other serotonergic agents or use in combination with SSRIs.14In our second case, RB had an imbalance of serotonin precipitated by an increase in fentanyl patch dosing.Methadone, a synthetic piperidine opioid, is a racemic mixture of R/S methadone enantiomers. It exerts its analgesia through opioid receptor agonism by R enantiomer and N -methyl-D -aspartate antagonism by S enantiomer.14It is metabolized by hepatic enzymes and is a CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, which indirectly inhibits metabolism of tramadol to its active metabolite M1, making tramadol less effective upon its concomitant usage.25In vitro studies of methadone show a greater tendency toward serotonin reuptake inhibition compared with other opiates, which may explain methadone-mediated precipitation of serotonin syndrome.4In our first case, SA's increased use of methadone was responsible for precipitation of serotonin syndrome.Tramadol is a racemic mixture of RR and SS enantiomers. It is metabolized by liver enzymes to a more pharmacologically active metabolite, M1.14The RR enantiomer is a μ receptor agonist, while the SS enantiomer inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and releases serotonin.25Thus tramadol results in intrasynaptic serotonin excess when combined with other serotonergic drugs.6Dextromethorphan, a d-isomer of levorphanol, is a cough suppressant via action on σ opioid receptors. Its active metabolite, dextrorphan, antagonizes N -methyl D -aspartate receptors, whereas dextromethorphan itself binds 5-HT2Areceptors that may cause serotonin syndrome.14,24,25Since the hepatic enzyme, CYP2D6 metabolizes it; an inhibitor of CYP2D6 can also further increase serotonin levels.14Serotonin syndrome is a diagnostic challenge because of its variable and overlapping clinical manifestations. This is further confounded by overall lack of awareness among physicians,7,26limitations of diagnostic criteria, inaccurate diagnosis, and individual differences in serotonin metabolism.26In fact, milder forms of this disorder may go unrecognized.14Our second case report exemplifies all of these challenges, which led to two misdiagnoses before serotonin syndrome was correctly diagnosed and treated.Serotonin syndrome should not be a diagnosis of exclusion but one made after careful history-taking, to glean information on changes in serotonin agents, and a focused physical exam. Index of suspicion should be high with a history of serotonergic agent intake and other medical and psychiatric conditions need to be excluded.6,7,12Patients with a history of known exposure to serotonergic agents may have a constellation of clinical symptoms described as a triad4,7,10,11,26of:Mental status changes: Anxiety, agitation, confusion, hypomania, visual hallucinations, restlessness, disorientation, and coma.Neuromuscular abnormalities: Muscle rigidity, tremors, nystagmus, myoclonus, ocular clonus, hyperreflexia, ataxia, and trismus.Autonomic instability: hyper/hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diarrhea, mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia.A predictable spectrum of symptom manifestation directly correlates with intrasynaptic serotonin level6,11,27,28(fig. 2). Milder forms may present with anxiety, akathisia, diarrhea, and tremors, but full-blown serotonin syndrome may present with altered mental status and myoclonus. Severe serotonin toxicity, however, may be a life-threatening crisis with muscular rigidity more pronounced in lower extremities, hyperthermia, and coma.6,11Symptoms with escalating toxicity, if left untreated, may result in more severe complications including metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, seizures, and death.3,7,10Typically, serotonin syndrome symptoms present soon after the offending medication regimen is initiated. Usually symptoms appear within 6 h of ingestion of the drug or drugs (60% of cases). By 24 h, a majority (more than 75%) of patients are symptomatic.7,10In a subset of patients (7%), some of whom are older, the onset may be delayed for a few days because of a decreased neurotransmitter serotonin synthesis and decreased receptor density with age (18% fall in 5-HT2Areceptors per decade).29Although symptoms resolve within 24 h of stopping the offending agent, in 60–70% of serotonin cases, there is still a 2–12% mortality risk associated with serotonin toxicity.7,15No specific lab abnormality is diagnostic of serotonin syndrome.7,12Blood serotonin level does not correlate with the severity of the disease since it does not reflect intrasynaptic serotonin level. Some observed lab abnormalities include electrolyte derangements, metabolic acidosis, increased creatinine, and increased serum aminotransferase.10,12,15These are associated with muscular hypertonicity and possible rhabdomyolysis, which may be seen in cases of severe serotonin toxicity.6,7,11Due to lack of specific laboratory tests, several clinical diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome have been established.3,7,30Of course, a history of recent exposure to serotonergic agent(s) is a prerequisite to considering serotonin syndrome and utilization of these criteria. The two most commonly used criteria for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are shown in table 3. They are Sternbach's Criteria, (sensitivity 75%, specificity 96%),11,30and Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, (sensitivity 84%, specificity 97%).30Several medical conditions, some involving toxicity, can mimic serotonin syndrome.4Many of these can be ruled out by careful, thorough history and physical examination. The clinical mimics include: neuroleptic syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic syndrome, opioid withdrawal, and acute opioid toxicity31(table 4).Neuroleptic syndrome can be precipitated by use of antipsychotic medications and may present with similar symptoms, such as hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor, stupor, and coma. The two entities differ in onset of symptoms, hyporeflexia, decrease or normal bowel sounds, lead-pipe rigidity, and hyperthermia of more than 41°C.14,31Malignant hyperthermia is differentiated by exposure to inhaled halogenated anesthetics or depolarizing paralytic agents with associated hyperthermia of 42–46°C, hypercarbia, acidosis, muscular rigidity, hyporeflexia, decreased bowel sound along with hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, mottled skin, and agitation.14,31Anticholinergic syndrome carries a history of tricyclic antidepressant or anticholinergic agent use and is associated with dry mouth, blurred vision, delirium, decreased bowel sounds along with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperthermia of 40°C.31Serotonin syndrome has a favorable prognosis with symptoms resolving in the majority of cases within 24 h of stopping the serotonergic agent10; however, in 30–40%, symptoms persist beyond 24 h and require more intense care15(fig. 2). Anxiety and agitation can be managed with anxiolytics. Moderate to severe presentation may require serotonin receptor antagonists, i.e. , cyproheptadine (per oral form in 2 mg incremental doses for a maximum of 12–32 mg in 24 h) or chlorpromazine, a phenothiazine derivative, (available in oral and intravenous formulation in a dose of 50–100 mg) to decrease intrasynaptic serotonin level through 5-HT blocking action.4,7,10Cyproheptadine is only available in oral form, which limits its usage if oral intake is not possible or activated charcoal is already used in management of toxic agent ingestion. Chlorpromazine is the preferred alternative as it can be administered in intravascular form, but the patient needs to be well hydrated to prevent significant hypotension from its use.4,9Severe symptoms require intensive care for neuromuscular paralysis and subsequent ventilatory support4,10,27to decrease rigidity, hyperthermia, and complications of rhabdomyolysis. Succinylcholine and physical restraints should be avoided due to detrimental effect in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms can also be managed by nitroglycerine through its conversion to nitric oxide,32short-acting benzodiazepines (i.e. , Lorazepam) for agitation, anxiety and hyperexcitatory symptoms,10,12and β blockers (i.e. , propranolol) for autonomic symptoms of serotonin syndrome.11,12A recent case report suggested some promise in the use of Intralipid for severe serotonin toxicity for its transient ability to draw tissue and receptor bound serotonergic drugs into lipid-expanded intravascular compartment, trapping them in a lipid phase33(fig. 2).It is undeniably easier to prevent than to have to treat serotonin syndrome. Prescribing physicians should strive to identify at-risk patients by maintaining clear and frequent communication with other prescribing physicians regarding changes and addition of new medications. Patients in an older age group, with multiple comorbidities or polypharmacy along with serotonergic drugs (fig. 1), or on monoamine oxidase inhibitors, should be considered as relatively high risk for development of serotonin syndrome. Physicians should also select the less toxic anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and morphine, over morphine analogues and piperidine opioids, when appropriate. Upon switching serotonergic agents, care should be given regarding their half-life to provide enough washout periods before trying newer serotonergic agent.7Serotonin syndrome is a complication of polypharmacy that has been described in the literature for decades. Its occurrence is attributed to missed and inaccurate diagnosis. Factors responsible for the missed diagnosis include lack of awareness and knowledge among health professionals regarding its clinical presentation and clear understanding of interactions among the multiple serotonergic medications. Variations in serotonin metabolism, overlapping clinical presentation, mild symptoms, and limitation of diagnostic criteria often make the diagnosis challenging. The common offending agents have been well characterized but there needs be a shift in attention to the commonly prescribed opioids as a possible trigger for the potentially deadly serotonin syndrome.Anesthesiologists need to be aware of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome in the perioperative setting, where high dose opioids are often administered. Similarly, practitioners in chronic pain management, where use of opioids in conjunction with other serotonergic agents is the norm, must also have heightened sense of awareness. Patient history should be carefully evaluated for concomitant use of serotonergic agents including mono-amine-oxidase inhibitor, SSRIs, and several nonprescribed agents, such as herbal medications, St. John's wort,34the street drug ecstasy,27,35commonly used cough syrup ingredient dextromethorphan, and weight loss drugs fenfluramine35and sibutramine. In addition, methylene blue37dye, which is commonly used intraoperatively to delineate lymphovascular channels, has also been shown to be associated with severe serotonin syndrome. Thus, seemingly unrelated classes of pharmacological agents have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome with simultaneous use of serotonergic agents. Opioids have now been recognized to be such an agent.The mechanism of increased serotonin levels caused by commonly used opioids is still being studied, and treatment options involve mostly supportive care of manifesting symptoms. Future therapy may be directed toward identifying the molecular and pharmacological variables and specific receptor action and/or antagonism, but the most effective treatment is likely preventive medicine. Polypharmacy needs to be carefully selected, monitored, and avoided where possible to achieve better patient care and decrease the risk of excessive socioeconomic burden to society.1As more research and physician awareness is directed toward serotonin syndrome, our insight into the condition will invariably expand, and both morbidity and mortality will be reduced.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is a very common symptom in primary care medicine. Psychiatric causes represent more than 80% of the cases. After excluding all known causes of fatigue, 30% of the patients remain without a specific diagnosis and suffered from idiopathic chronic fatigue. The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) which represents a very small subset of these patients is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by fatigue, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and various other somatic complaints. The cause remains underdetermined and most of the treatments are ineffective. Antidepressants drugs may be helpful. A supportive approach, cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise seem so far the only evidence-based therapeutic approach.",

Currently, the patient is taking the maximum dose of a form of long-acting methylphenidate. He is responding to this regimen better than the previous options tried. However, he is still having breakthrough symptoms (ie, forgetfulness, difficulty with organization, and inability to sustain attention). Neurologic examinations at each visit have been normal.

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

      "abstract": "Sexual hallucination is one of the distressful psychotic symptoms experienced across a variety of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, sedative use, narcolepsy, and night terror, as well as in other conditions like epilepsy. Hence, ruling out organicity is a must in these cases. Among all psychiatric conditions, it is most commonly seen in Schizophrenia. It can be experienced in various modalities such as auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, somatic, and tactile. Such symptoms are often missed due to the patient’s feeling of embarrassment as well as the clinician’s indifference to elicit such psychopathology. However, these may form part of residual symptoms in Schizophrenia, which may increase the burden of disability and, therefore, contribute to its chronic, unremitting course. Such symptoms can be attributed to the dopamine rush in the mesolimbic pathway, and thus, antipsychotic drugs are the treatment of choice. Usually, most cases are found to be associated with a history of childhood sexual trauma, which needs to be addressed for focused psychotherapy. In this article, we have described three cases of Schizophrenia who presented with sexual hallucinations in the absence of any comorbid medical or psychiatric illness and showed response to various dosages of Olanzapine. Two of them had complete remission of sexual hallucinations, and one had near-complete resolution. All three patients returned to their normal functioning during treatment with a variable period of treatment with olanzapine and/or psychotherapy.",

However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

This is an attitude that they unfortunately share with most nonalcoholics; therefore some tact is required in referring them for treatment. If the alcoholic demonstrates abnormal behavior, appears depressed, or evidences a disturbance in his thinking (most frequently, ill-founded or illogical suspicions or grandiose opinions), he should certainly be examined psychiatrically, since in such cases the drinking may only be symptomatic of a severe underlying mental disturbance.

Gewissermaßen Prototyp der somatoformen Störungen ist die Somatisierungsstörung (F45.0), die bei Patienten mit multiplen körperlichen Beschwerden, die über mindestens zwei Jahre persistieren, diagnostiziert wird. Insgesamt lassen sich die somatoformen Störungen in drei Hauptgruppen aufteilen. Zur größten Gruppe zählen die Patienten mit multiplen körperlichen Beschwerden. Die zweite Gruppe umfasst Patienten mit eng umschriebener Symptomatik, während die dritte Gruppe aus Patienten mit Hypochondrie und körperdysmorphen Störungen besteht. Die häufigsten komorbiden Störungen sind depressive Störungen und Angststörungen. Mit somatoformen Beschwerden gehen sowohl bestimmte psychophysiologische Aktivierungsprozesse als auch spezifische kognitive Stile einher. Die Behandlung der somatoformen Störungen umfasst sowohl die kompetente organmedizinische als auch die psychotherapeutische Behandlung. Hier haben sich kognitiv-behaviorale Therapieelemente bewährt.

Its goal is to provide readers with a practical and educational overview of managing these symptoms. Cognitive disorders, including dementia, result from the disruption of higher cortical functions of the brain. Dementia often manifests not only through cognitive dysfunction but also through BPSD, such as agitation, aggression, anxiety, psychosis, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms affect up to 97% of patients with dementia and significantly reduce the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. BPSD are often more stressful for patients and caregivers than the cognitive symptoms themselves. Behavioural symptoms include a wide range of manifestations from non-aggressive forms such as pacing and repetitive movements to aggressive and agitated behaviour (verbal and physical). Psychological symptoms can include depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms such as paranoia and delusions. The causes of BPSD can be varied, as well as their risk factors (including e.g. co-medication, comorbidities, the patient's personality traits, inappropriate communication by caregivers, and environmental influences). The pharmacotherapy of BPSD is complex and often involves the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Due to the diversity of manifestations and causes of BPSD, a unified pharmacotherapeutic approach cannot be applied. Non-pharmacological approaches should always be preferred, except in cases of severe depression, psychosis, or aggression that may endanger the patient or someone else. In practice, many medications indicated for BPSD therapy are used off-label. The pharmacotherapy of BPSD should only begin after ruling out other causes of BPSD. Furthermore, it should only be initiated after considering all risks and potential benefits, starting with low geriatric doses, monitoring side effects, regularly reassessing effectiveness, and administering medications for the shortest possible duration should be also applied.",

      "title": "The Bipolar Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Byline: M. Reddy it to Broaden it to Shrink it to Broaden it.... ! is the beginning and a part of Mania…. The development of Mania is really a worsening of the disease (Melancholia) rather than change into another disease. (Aretaeus of Cappadocia, 100 AD). Mania is Primary, with Depression being the consequence of preceding Mania, which means the Recurrent Unipolar subgroup of MDI does not really exist since all depressive presentations are preceded by a manic presentation. (Koukopoulos, 2006). That Happiness and Sadness, the two normal and very common emotions of every human being, constitute the core clinical features of a disease, Depressive Illness (MDI), remains a fascinating, though disturbing, fact. The magnification of joy and worry, two poles of the normal emotional spectrum, reaches such gigantic proportion necessitating treatment. The clinical presentation varying between the two poles, often alternating, naturally reveals itself as a spectrum disorder of conditions and related temperaments. For Eugene Bleuler a patient was predominantly schizophrenic or predominantly manic-depressive in the spectrum of psychosis. But Emil Kraeplin, father of classification in modern psychiatry, segregated the two major psychotic illnesses into Manic-depressive insanity and Dementia praecox. By 1913, Kraeplin brought virtually all of the major clinical forms, which had *Episodic or Periodic course *Benign prognosis *Family history of MDI, under the diagnosis of -Depressive illness (MDI) in which he included Bipolar Disorders (BD) and Recurrent Depressive Disorders. The Bipolar Spectrum concept can be approached from two different ways: *Manic - Depressive Spectrum: Continuum between Bipolar and Unipolar *Bipolar Spectrum: Restricted to BD with continuum between Full blown illness (BD I) to Milder illness to Temperament traits (Cyclothymia ……). Understanding the concept of Bipolar/Manic Depressive Spectrum demands a brief journey into the history dating back to the last quarter of 19th century. SHRINK IT - 1875-1925 [Figure 1]{Figure 1} The Northwest Wales asylum, opened in 1848, catered to a specific geographic location of the population and had admission of 3172 patients from 1875 to 1924. As depicted in the graph, mania as percentage of all admissions was 60% in 1885 which got Shrunk to around 20% in 1920. In 1885, the diagnosis of mania referred to any state of OVERACTIVE INSANITY. Around 1900, primarily in response to Kraeplin's impact, the use of mania as a diagnosis in North Wales began to fall (limited only to episodic illness with benign course) progressively to about 4% in 1924.[1] BROADEN IT: 2nd quarter of 20th century Manic Depressive insanity….. includes on one hand the whole domain of periodic and circular insanity, on the other hand simple mania, the greater parts of the morbid states termed Melancholia (Emil Kreaplin, 1924). [INLINE:1] The unifying Broadeningconcept of MDI, which brought together all the mood disorders, separating from Dementia Praecox, was based on *Episodic, recurrent course of illness *Benign course and outcome. SHRINK IT (again): 2nd half of 20th Century Move forward to the 3rd quarter and the first half of the 4th quarter of 20th century. The Kreaplinian concept of MDI was considered too inclusive and in 1957 Karl Leonhard proposed the concept, propagated later by the works of Angst, 2002,[2] and Perris, of dividing the MDI into two sub groups: Bipolar and Unipolar, the only difference being presence/absence of mania. The Broad MDI concept was shrunk again by separating BD group away from the unipolar group. The term bipolar was introduced in DSM III in 1980 and in ICD 10 in 1992; since then the unipolar and BD are categorized as two separate diagnostic entities in the classificatory system. …",

      "title": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with Psychotic Features:-A Phenomenological Study",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) lies in a cuntinuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders. Patients of pure OCD develop psychotic symptoms when there is a transient loss of insight or there is emergence of paranoid ideas. Depression is frequently associated with OCD, which could either be a complication of OCD or could be an independent coexisting disorder. In our study, 17 out of 52 OCD patients had psychotic features. Relatively more patients in the psychotic group were found to be single. They had higher score on YBOCS, BPRS and HDRS (SIGH-D} as compared to the OCD patients without psychotic features, 76.47% of the patients with psychotic features also fulfilled the DSM III-R criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. The possible explanation and implication of the findings have been discussed in the light of relevant literature. Key words: obsession, compulsion, psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms INTRODUCTION Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD) is characterized by recurrent obsessions or compulsion that are significantly distressing or time consuming or that cause significant interference with social or occupational functioning (DSM IIIR, APA, 1987). It has been postulated that obsessive compulsive disorders lies in a continuum between schizophrenia and the neurotic disorders (Goldberg, 1965; Blacker, 1966). Obsessive compulsive symptoms have also been observed in schizophrenia (Stengel, 1945. Rosen, 1957; Fenton McGlashan, 1990), in whom obsession may precede schizophrenic symptoms. Earlier studies by Rudin (1953), Ingrain (1961), and Lo (1967) have shown that 1%-10% of patients with OCD subsequently develop schizophrenia, however Goodwin et al (l969) pointed out that most of these studies had used a broad criteria for the diagnosis of OCD. Inspite of the high incidence of psychosis in, OCD most of the cases cannot be diagnosed as schizophrenia according to current diagnostic systems. Welner et al (1976) had reported that out of their 14 patients of OCD with psychotic symptoms (having delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) only 2 met the criteria for schizophrenia while the remaining 12 showed prominent affective symptoms. The relation between OCD and depression is complex, with some believing depression to be a complication of OCD (Lo, 1967; Rosenberg, 1968, Goodwin et al, 1969), whilst others believe that OCD and depression are two distinct disorders which often co-exist (Monteiro et al. 1986; Jenike et al, 1987. Vallejo et al, 1988: Rasmussen & Eisen, 1989). Goodwin et al (1969), after reviewing 13 follow-up studies had concluded that OCD patients were predisposed to depression but did not develop schizophrenia more frequently than non obsessional patients. In fact, Insel Akiskal (1986) have asserted that in the current classificatory systems most of the OCD cases with psychotic features will be either diagnosed as snood disorders or paranoid state rather than schizophrenia. The present study was conducted to assess the presence of psychotic features and depression simultaneously in OCD patients in whom schizophrenia was ruled out and to examine the relationship between the psychotic features and depression. MATERIALS AND METHOD This study was conducted at Central Institute of Psychiatry (C.I.P.), which is a 643 bedded premier postgraduate teaching institute situated in eastern India. It is run by the Central government of India, and is an important referral centre for the collieries, the railways, the states of Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar Orissa, the entire north-eastern states and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The hospital also gets referrals from the neighboring countries like Nepal and Bhutan. The Institute runs postgraduate training courses in Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology, Psychiatric Social Work and Psychiatric Nursing. In the OPD all cases are worked up by junior residents. …",

Il apparaît que ces troubles survenant dans des circonstances hétérogènes entraînent des manifestations cliniques variées, qu'il faut savoir reconnaître afin de traiter ses patients de manière efficace. Psychiatric disorders due to alimentary or toxic conditions may be observed in various clinical and pathophysiological domains. All induced drugs, modes of exposure, voluntary or not, and clinical symptoms related to acute or chronic exposure must be identified. We first describe the psychiatric disorders related to psycholeptic, psychoanaleptic and psychodysleptic drugs. Then we describe the symptoms induced by various toxic agents among professional exposure, and disorders of alimentary origin, related to some food or alcohol consumption. Such disorders occur in heterogeneous circumstances so the related symptomatology appears various. We emphasize the necessity to well identify such clinical situations and psychiatric disorders in order to provide patients with the best therapeutic management.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

      "title": "Chronic Migraine, Classification, Differential Diagnosis, and Epidemiology",
      "abstract": "( Headache 2011;51;S2:77‐83) Chronic migraine (CM) is the most disabling of the 4 types of primary chronic daily headache (CDH) of long duration, a syndrome defined by primary headaches 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months with attacks that last 4 hours or more per day on average. CDH of long duration includes CM, chronic tension‐type headache, new daily persistent headache, and hemicrania continua. CM affects approximately 2% of the adult population in Western countries, imposing substantial burdens on individual sufferers and their families and, more broadly, upon society. Although this disorder is highly disabling and prevalent, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Diagnosing CM requires a systematic approach that includes these steps: (1) exclude a secondary headache disorder, and (2) diagnose a specific primary headache syndrome based on frequency and duration, for example, short‐duration episodic, long‐duration episodic, or long‐duration chronic. CM usually develops as a complication of episodic migraine after a period of increasing headache frequency. This migraine transformation is associated with a number of risk factors, some of which cannot be modified, including age and race. Other risk factors for CM are modifiable, such as obesity, snoring, head injury, stressful life events, and overuse of opioids and barbiturates. However, risk factor modification has not yet been shown to decrease the likelihood of CM onset. According to a cross‐sectional analysis of data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study published this year in Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry , when compared to patients with episodic migraine, patients with CM were significantly less likely to be employed full‐time and almost twice as likely to be occupationally disabled. In addition, patients with CM were nearly twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, or depression. Furthermore, patients with CM had higher cardiovascular and respiratory risk, were 40% more likely to have heart disease and angina, and were 70% more likely to have a history of stroke. These findings highlight the paramount importance of clinical vigilance, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate, effective management – including treatment or referrals – to improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

For a variety of clinical and methodological reasons, this remains an area that begs for new investigation. At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

      "title": "The effect of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity on sleep, brain and cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract In alcohol use disorder, drinking cessation is frequently associated with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Early in abstinence (within the first 2 months after drinking cessation), when patients do not exhibit physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome anymore (such as nausea, tremor or anxiety), studies report various brain, sleep and cognitive alterations, highly heterogeneous from one patient to another. While the acute neurotoxicity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is well-known, its contribution to structural brain alterations, sleep disturbances and neuropsychological deficits observed early in abstinence has never been investigated and is addressed in this study. We included 54 alcohol use disorder patients early in abstinence (from 4 to 21 days of sobriety) and 50 healthy controls. When acute physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were no longer present, patients performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment, a T1-weighted MRI and a polysomnography for a subgroup of patients. According to the severity of the clinical symptoms collected during the acute withdrawal period, patients were subsequently classified as mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome (mild-AWS) patients (Cushman score ≤ 4, no benzodiazepine prescription, N = 17) or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome (moderate-AWS) patients (Cushman score &amp;gt; 4, benzodiazepine prescription, N = 37). Patients with severe withdrawal complications (delirium tremens or seizures) were not included. Mild-AWS patients presented similar grey matter volume and sleep quality as healthy controls, but lower processing speed and episodic memory performance. Compared to healthy controls, moderate-AWS patients presented non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, widespread grey matter shrinkage and lower performance for all the cognitive domains assessed (processing speed, short-term memory, executive functions and episodic memory). Moderate-AWS patients presented a lower percentage of slow-wave sleep, grey matter atrophy in fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus regions, and lower short-term memory and executive performance than mild-AWS patients. Mediation analyses revealed both direct and indirect (via fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus atrophy) relationships between poor sleep quality and cognitive performance. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, which reflects neurotoxic hyperglutamatergic activity, should be considered as a critical factor for the development of non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, fronto-insular atrophy and executive impairments in recently detoxified alcohol use disorder patients. The glutamatergic activity is involved in sleep-wake circuits and may thus contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related brain damage, resulting in cognitive deficits. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and sleep quality deserve special attention for a better understanding and treatment of brain and cognitive alterations observed early in abstinence, and ultimately for more efficient relapse prevention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic depression is a unique subtype of depressive illness in which mood disturbance is accompanied by delusions, ballucinations, or both. Once considered relatively uncommon, it is frequently encountered in clinical practice, particularly in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Psychotically depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressants, but remission is likely with neuroleptic-antidepressant combinations or electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotic depression may be unipolar or bipolar with early or late onset and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of childhood psychic trauma. Much is known about the course and treatment response of obvious presentations of psychotic depression, but more must be learned about depressed patients who have intermittent, subtle, or mild psychotic symptoms and about the ways in which the capacity to become psychotic interacts with the capacity to become depressed to produce a syndrome greater than the sum of its parts.",

      "title": "Irritability as a Criterion in Diagnosis of Child and Adolescent Bipolar Disorder: Thorny Road Ahead",
      "abstract": "Byline: M. Reddy Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 [sup]th edition (DSM 5) [sup][1] of bipolar disorder (BD) makes it necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic episode: distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, OR IRRITABLE MOOD… lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly everyday…. It is elation or irritation, along with three or four other symptoms. DSM 5 criteria for BD are applicable to all age groups with the same weightage. Irritable occupies a prominent place in the diagnostic criteria of many other disorders, especially childhood and adolescent disorders like oppositional defiant disorder; intermittent explosive disorder; conduct disorder; disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD); other and unspecified disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders; and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the classificatory systems. With irritable sharing space in the diagnostic criteria of BD and several childhood and adolescent diagnostic disorders, there looms a possibility of over diagnosis of childhood adolescent bipolar disorder. misdiagnosis, whenever it occurs, hopefully less often, leads to a major therapeutic mismatch resulting in polypharmacy and treatment failures. National Institute of Mental Health research roundtable on prepubertal bipolar disorder, 2001 recommends that patients with grandiosity/elation be classified as bipolar I and irritability/rage be classified as bipolar NOS (DSM IV TR). There was always a doubt about reliability of irritability as a symptom criterion in the of mania as shown in this USA-UK study: USA-UK project (2005) Elation/grandiose - mania - 96.4% USA and 88.9% UK Irritability/rage - mania - 86.2% USA and 31.1% UK There is rather unacceptable poor concordance, with irritability as the criterion. A few valid arguments that merit attention are the following: *That delusions/hallucinations occur only in BD (true, but a significant majority of patients with BD do not have delusions/hallucinations). *Family H/O of BD favors of bipolar illness (yes, very valuable supporting point in those who have a family history). *BD is an episodic disorder, whereas other childhood disorders outlined above are all continuous in course. Is it true? Let us look at the existing data. Evidence Age of onset The greatest frequency of first attacks falls, however, in the period of development with its increased emotional excitability between the fifteenth and twentieth In rare cases, the first beginnings can be traced back even to before the tenth year…. - Kraepelin, 1921 In 28% of the BD patients recruited into the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, age at onset was younger than 13, and in the Bipolar Collaborative Network study, 15% of patients had illness onset before the age of 13 years. younger age of onset in BD seems to be a well-documented fact. Diagnosis Some studies have defined mania by the presence of highly labile moods with intense irritability, rage, explosiveness and destructiveness; extreme agitation, and behavioral dysregulation. [sup][2],[3],[4],[5] picture that emerges from several independent research groups is that prepubertal children with BD typically have multiple daily mood swings and that irritability is much more common than euphoria. [sup][6],[7] Course Studies indicate a highly pernicious course with substantial chronicity. In 81% of a well-defined group of patients, Geller et al . [sup][6] reported continuous daily cycling from mania or hypomania to euthymia or depression. In this study, 1-year mania recovery rate stood at 37%. …",

In only 14.5% of cases the pre-manifest period was characterized by personality accentuation. Analysis of cases of the latent course of the disease has made it possible to distinguish three main variants of its clinical manifestations: hypoparanoid, psychopathy-like and neurosis-like. On the basis of these findings a conclusion can be drawn that most of the cases of schizophrenia manifested in old age by the syndrome of involutional paranoid belong to a group of diseases with an early onset, prolonged torpid or latent course, and with increased progression of the process in advanced age.",

      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

EnglishCONTRIBUTION OF NURSING AND IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY REGARDING THE ASSISTANCE OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CONFUSIONAL SYNDROME Abstract Introduction and objectives. The acute confusional syndrome (ACS) is a familiar process that may occur after hospitalisation and which can be defined as a transitory mental disorder, characterised by a global disturbance in cognition and attention as well as a low consciousness level, an alteration of psychomotor function and a disorder in the sleep-wake cycle. It appears in a sudden, acute way, specially at night, together with other organic processes and it has got a relatively short duration (less than a month) Objective: to analyse the population and its demographic and clinical features in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and show nursing contribution after a clinical trial on actions in ACS cases. Instruments and methodology Type of research: clinical trial, randonized, not blind , with parallel samples, prospective, analytical and longitudinal. Sample: patients hospitalized in the ICU that comply with the required characteristics. Case: patient who develops ACS in the ICU and who has all the inclusion requirements and has no exclusion ones. Place : The ICU of the Hospital General Universitario in the Region of Murcia. Timing : Two years of field research. Development: after the patient admission in the ICU, general data is collected, implementing familiar risks factors, sociodemographic data and clinical data among others. CAM-ICU and scale level of sedation (SAS) validated questionnaires are provided to the nursing staff, who will implement environmental control measures, reorientation and other interventions in the study group. Statistical processing : by means of IBM SPSS Statistics v.20. A descriptive statistic with calculated weighted mean has been applied, together with standard deviation for the quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for the qualitative ones. The statistical inference has been calculated on a maximum error of 5% and a 95% of reliability (confidence), accepting statistical meaning if p Calculation of Chi of Pearson, with study of corrected non-valid data. For the expected lower frequences, the Fisher exact statistics has been applied. The Student T Test has been used for the comparison of independent samples for the equality of means. Ethical considerations : The study has been approved by the CEIC of the Health Department and the UMU Results: Population: 1093 patients; age: 65,4 years of age, DE16, male 64%; Level of severity APACHE II 15 out of 9; Average ICU stay: 5,77 days; Discarded samples: 15%; most frequent diagnosis: acute coronary syndrome without st elevation (SCASEST). 6,8% develop SCA and comply with requirements. Control group 34 (52%), intervention group 33 (48%). Their ICU stay has ranged between 7 and 11 days, having 5 predisposing factors and 6-7 precipitating factors. The SCA condition has lasted between 36 and 48 hours. The nursing staff provide a specific planning care to the study group, with an average of 14 interventions in every working shift, devoting 43,71 minutes. Conclusions: The epidemiologic profile of a patient with a SCA condition is male, 74,4 years old, independent, retired whose reason for hospitalisation is coronary heart disease and/ or sepsis/septic shock with a low-medium level of severity, with a medical history of ATH, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and stroke. Previous smoking habits have also proved to be an influential factor. The patients have been treated with Haloperidol for delirium control. The application of nursing methodology together with an individual care plan on these patients have been highly effective as it has reduced both the SCA process and patient recovery time.",

      "title": "Psychological and psychiatric factors of chronic pain",
      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

Malgre les nombreux progres de la prevention et du traitement medical de l’epilepsie de l’enfant, le taux de troubles psychopathologiques reste stable depuis plus de trente ans. Certains troubles ne sont pas plus frequemment retrouves que chez des temoins avec maladie chronique (depression), alors que d’autres le sont davantage (troubles de l’attention, troubles sociaux, troubles de la pensee), ou sont particulierement associes a certains syndromes epileptiques (troubles envahissants du developpement). D’autre part, des troubles du comportement et la depression sont parfois retrouves avant l’apparition d’une epilepsie, ce qui plaide en faveur d’un dysfonctionnement neurobiologique commun a l’epilepsie et aux troubles psychiatriques. L’etude des variables influencant l’apparition de tels troubles montre des resultats contradictoires. Les variables propres a l’epilepsie ne semblent pas influer sur les troubles psychiatriques, sauf par le biais des troubles cognitifs secondaires a l’epilepsie. En revanche, les variables familiales (troubles du fonctionnement familial, depression maternelle plus frequemment retrouves que chez les parents d’enfants temoins), et surtout la perception parentale du controle de l’epilepsie predisent mieux l’ajustement parental que le niveau de controle de l’epilepsie.

In this chapter, the terms “dual diagnosis,” “substance use disorder[s],” “[name of substance] use,” and/or “[name of substance] dependence” are used. The more modern term “co-occurring disorder” is virtually synonymous with “dual diagnosis,” both of which reference the coexistence of a clinically significant use of drugs and/or alcohol with a primary psychiatric illness (an example of this would be bipolar disorder with cocaine dependence). Of course, a patient can have a substance use disorder (SUD) without having a dual diagnosis – i.e., without a separate, primary psychiatric illness [1]. The assumption is made that, unless mentioned specifically, clinical situations discussed here involve patients who do have a primary psychiatric illness in addition to a SUD. Also, although the fairly recent, though now outdated, DSM-IV criteria differentiated between substance abuse and substance dependence, this volume (again, unless specifically mentioned) does not make that distinction.",

Nocturnal symptoms include difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early awakening, and interrupted or nonrestorative sleep. Daytime symptoms include distress about poor nocturnal sleep and impairment in any role function or other aspects of overall well-being. Researchers have traditionally used quantitative criteria to diagnose insomnia, but these criteria have not been standardized.

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

Thus, someone could remain symptomatic from concussion more than two weeks following the injury. At that point, however, the discerning clinician must differentiate prolonged concussion symptoms from the evolution of persistent symptoms from comorbid neurologic conditions or emerging mental health symptoms or disorders. Too often, prolonged or persistent symptoms are not considered in the context of initial concussion injury and symptoms, proper return to activity, or emerging comorbid conditions that can also lead to persistent symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

      "abstract": "In 44 patients with periodical forms of schizophrenia at different stages of the stereotypical acute attack, the authors performed experimental psychological tests in order to study different aspects of intellectual activity (attention, memory, special-constructive and semantic thinking). It was established that the development of attacks was accompanied by increasing disorders of voluntary attention. Depending upon the sign of dominating effects, disordered active attention was accompanied either by acceleration and lability, or by delayed and inert psychic processes. This leads to an increasing disturbances in the organization of all forms of intellectual activity, up to a total inhibition of active psychic reflection at the clinical phase of the attack. The supposition is made that these disorders are connected with the changes in the level of brain vigilance.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition wherein epileptic seizure discharges are sufficiently prolonged or repetitive so as to produce persistent alterations in neurologic function and in the underlying physiologic and neurochemical activities of the brain. Thus, the definition of SE now includes any disorder in which there is sustained and prolonged excitation of neurons. Electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns associated with specific types of SE are important components in their classification. Like epileptic seizures, SE can be divided into partial onset SE and primarily generalized SE. Partial onset SE includes secondarily generalized convulsive SE (GCSE), complex partial SE (CPSE), simple partial SE (SPSE), and the syndromes of epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) and rolandic SE (RSE). Primarily generalized SE includes primarily GCSE, absence SE, atypical absence SE, generalized myoclonic SE, generalized clonic SE, generalized tonic SE, atonic SE, and the syndromes of electrical SE of sleep (ESES) and minor epileptic SE of Brett. SE is a dynamic disorder. Behavioral and electrical manifestations change over time if seizure activity is allowed to persist without successful treatment A progression from overt to subtle convulsive activity occurs in secondarily GCSE and there is also a progression of predictable EEG changes in prolonged GCSE. CPSE begins as discrete complex partial seizures but also progresses behaviorally and electrically through a sequence similar to that observed in GCSE. Progressive behavioral and electrical changes have not been reported in primarily generalized forms of SE. EEG is an important tool for verifying successful treatment of SE if the patient does not immediately recover neurologic function. EEG recordings also contribute substantially to understanding the mechanisms of, and development of better treatments for, human SE through their use in the study of experimental SE in the laboratory.",

      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

Psychotic symptoms are frequent in ad and often include delusions of infidelity and hallucinations. When present, ad with psychosis is accompanied by elevated levels of depression and greater functional impairment. This case expands upon the existing literature on EOAD through the timeline of a complex psychosis presentation accompanied by rapid cognitive decline.63-year-old, Hispanic, woman with progressive cognitive changes (e.g., confusion, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, disorganization) that emerged 5 years prior to seeking neurological consultation. Psychosis symptoms (i.e., auditory/visual hallucinations, delusions), in the context of real events (i.e., husband's previous infidelity), developed simultaneously. These pervasive symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal, persistent suicidal tendencies, and impaired IADLs. Neuroimaging suggested hypometabolism in the parietotemporal regions with precuneus and posterior cingulate gyri involvement.The evaluation revealed fairly generalized cognitive decline. Basic attention, working memory, visual abstract reasoning, and phonemic fluency were intact. Visual integration/visuoconstruction were reduced. Impairments emerged in processing speed, rapid cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition, conceptualization, visuospatial orientation, semantic fluency, confrontation naming, and visual and verbal encoding and retention (with rapid forgetting). She endorsed moderately elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety.The pattern of cognitive and functional deficits are all suggestive of an ad process. Her age, sex, significant neuroimaging findings, report of earliest cognitive symptoms, and family history reinforce an EOAD etiology. Significant behavioral changes are often associated with increased cognitive impairment and in turn, may mark the progression/stage of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

      "abstract": "The principal psychiatric syndrome seen in patients with premenstrual tension syndrome is depressive disorder. Questions that should be used to evaluate depression are reviewed and the addition of structured questionnaires for the depressive symptoms is not considered useful in this assessment. Other conditions that may or may not be related to the premenstrual period include psychosis (especially depression and mania), alcoholism, anxiety, and bulimia. Brief questioning concerning these conditions can be performed relatively quickly during the clinical evaluation. Second-source information should be obtained when at all possible. If treatable psychiatric illness is identified in those with premenstrual tension, it should be treated as if the psychiatric syndrome alone were present. There is no indication, however, that such treatment will alter the course of the premenstrual condition should it be present as well.",

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas.

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking. The findings suggest that early-onset depression is associated with a greater degree of comorbidity and may represent a more serious form of the disorder.",

Nach der „Global Burden of Disease”-Studie der WHO gehören depressive Störungen schon jetzt zu den Erkrankungen, die zum größten Verlust an Lebensjahren aufgrund der Beeinträchtigung durch die Störung führen. Depressionen werden von den Betroffenen als beeinträchtigender erlebt als die meisten somatischen Erkrankungen. Hinzu kommt, dass viele chronische somatische Erkrankungen im Verlauf durch das Hinzutreten einer depressiven Störung weiter verkompliziert werden. Bei vielen Erkrankten wird die Diagnose nur mit großer Verzögerung oder gar nicht gestellt, und wenn sie richtig gestellt wird, erfolgt die Behandlung oft nur unzureichend. Wahrscheinlich werden weniger als 10 % der Betroffenen medikamentös adäquat behandelt. Dies liegt auch daran, dass nach wie vor nicht nur z.B. Patienten mit schizophrenen Störungen oder Substanzabhängigkeiten von gesellschaftlicher Stigmatisierung betroffen sind, sondern auch Patienten mit depressiven Störungen. Auch dies trägt dazu bei, dass viele von dieser schwerwiegenden Erkrankung Betroffene den Gang zum Arzt scheuen. Konsens ist heute auch, dass das Ziel der Behandlung nicht mehr nur die Response, d.h. das (partielle) Ansprechen auf die Therapie, sein darf, sondern dass in jedem Fall die Remission angestrebt werden muss.",

This test consists of two subtests, one with associative distractors and the other without distractors, which are matched on discriminating power and thus permit the assessment of differential specific performance deficit uncontaminated by the generalized deficit characteristic of many patient groups. Results indicated that some susceptibility to associative intrusions characterizes all groups of long-term patients regardless of diagnosis. Short-term patients (with the possible exception of schizophrenic) did not show such heightened susceptibility. Lengthy illness and/or stay in hospital are apparently implicated in at least this form of thought disorder, which has been often considered to be a uniquely schizophrenic phenomenon.",

A condition with identical symptoms, known as secondary mania, generally occurs in isolation in older adults and has an identifiable organic etiology. Here, we report a 57-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a 3 weeks history of sudden onset mania with psychotic symptoms. He had no previous psychiatric history, and his presentation coincided with the initiation of a course of steroids. Despite the absence of physical symptoms, investigations revealed a previously undetected adrenocorticotropic hormone-releasing small cell lung carcinoma that led to his death within months. This case highlights the complexity of distinguishing primary from secondary mania when it occurs after the peak incidence period of early adulthood. Undertaking a comprehensive medical workup is generally recommended.",

Assim, sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, dores abdominais, vômitos, neuropatia aguda, convulsões e distúrbios mentais como alucinações, depressão, paranoia e ansiedades são referentes ao aspecto agudo. Já em casos crônicos, a manifestação clínica se dá sob a forma de fotossensibilidade cutânea. O tratamento é realizado após a descoberta dos sintomas. Sendo a Porfiria uma doença considerada rara e com poucos estudos relacionados a ela, este trabalho abrange suas principais características, diferenciando-a segundo sua classificação.",

      "title": "Practical Approach for the Diagnosis and Management of Insomnia During Menopausal Transition",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "abstract": "The difference in symptomatology between the acute and post-acute phase of schizophrenia was examined in the present study using prospective and longitudinal assessment of 86 newly admitted schizophrenic patients. In the acute phase of illness, four symptom components emerged (negative symptoms, excited, delusional/hallucinatory, and thought disorder) and three components were evident (negative symptoms, mixed symptoms, and thought disorder) in the post-acute phase. The negative component in the post-acute phase had the same composition as that in the acute phase. The composition of thought disorder barely persisted over the phase of illness. These findings suggest that the negative symptom component is stable while the difference in the phase of illness has some effects on the symptom structure of schizophrenia.",

Generalement, elles manifestent des reactions de stress depasse sous forme d’etat de choc ou d’agitation, voire de reactions mecaniques dont l’apparente normalite est souvent trompeuse. Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs. Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines. Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique. Il s’observe frequemment des l’âge de 3 ans. Il se caracterise par la reviviscence de l’evenement adverse sous forme de symptomes intrusifs (flash-back, souvenirs repetitifs, cauchemars, impression que l’evenement pourrait se renouveler, phenomenes moteurs elementaires, conduite de repetition et jeux repetitifs, detresse et reactivite physiologique a l’exposition d’indices rappelant l’evenement), par l’emoussement de la reactivite generale (desinteret pour l’entourage et les activites) et l’evitement des stimuli qui lui sont associes (lieux, personnes, conversations, pensees et sentiments) ainsi que par une hyper activation neurovegetative. – Les nourrissons, les enfants et les adolescents manifestent frequemment des troubles non specifiques aux syndromes post-traumatiques tels les troubles anxieux (crises d’angoisse, agitation, surveillance inquiete de l’environnement, attachement anxieux, exacerbation des peurs infantiles), des symptomes depressifs (desarroi, tristesse, sentiment de solitude, inhibition motrice et intellectuelle, repli sur soi, sentiments de culpabilite excessifs et inappropries), des desordres psychosomatiques (symptomes neurovegetatifs, asthenie, douleurs psychogenes, regain d’une maladie psychosomatique preexistante), des perturbations du comportement (auto – et hetero-agressivite, conduites a risque, instabilite motrice, troubles du sommeil, desordres alimentaires, dependances) ainsi que des comportements regressifs et des difficultes d’apprentissage. – Le DSM-IV repertorie l’Etat de Stress Aigu englobant tant les reactions de survenue immediate durant au moins deux jours que les reponses post-immediates perdurant jusqu’a quatre semaines apres l’incident.

Patients have alternate increased mood and activities (mania, hypomania, or “ups” period) and declining mood and activities (depressive or “downs” period) in their life. Symptoms of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder include sensitive feelings, lack of rest, and shot up self-esteem, while the depressive episodes bring loss of interest, more or less sleep than usual, anxiety, a feeling of worthlessness, and lack of concentration. Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder with a fairly high prevalence of 1%- 2% and is the 5th cause of disability in the world. Many factors have been considered to contribute to this disorder. While there is strong evidence that some genetic and environmental factors are associated with bipolar disorder, only a few can provide sufficient evidence to establish causality. This report discusses the case of a new manic episode of bipolar disorder that occurs in a woman aged 25 years old who works as a public figure, announcer, and entertainer. The patient has been hospitalized several times and received various pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy but still having difficulties in managing the ups and downs of her emotion. A lot of individual factors must be considered in managing patients with bipolar disorder.",

Schizophrenia often takes a chronic course and patients exhibit difficulty re-attaining their optimum level even after resolution of clinical symptoms.

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

Up to 75% of reproductive-aged women have reported premenstrual symptoms at some time during their lives. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, which affects 3-8% of reproductive-aged women. The hallmark of premenstrual syndrome at all levels of severity is the exclusive occurrence of symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle with remission typically within 3 days of menses onset.",

Na trudności diagnostyczne nakładają się także te wynikające z konieczność różnicowania ChAD z innymi zaburzeniami rozpoczynającymi się w okresie dziecięco-młodzieżowym z jednoczesnym uwzględnieniem możliwości ich współwystępowania. Dotyczy to głównie zaburzeń hiperkinetycznych, zachowania, osobowości borderline czy uzależnienia od substancji psychoaktywnych. Około 50% pacjentów prezentuje objawy ChAD przed 18 rokiem życia, a średni czas od ich pojawienia się do postawienia właściwej diagnozy wynosi 5-10 lat. Nierozpoznane ChAD mogą mieć negatywny wpływ na rozwój kompetencji emocjonalnych, społecznych i poznawczych co istotnie wpływa na funkcjonowanie pacjenta także w życiu dorosłym. Dlatego tak ważne jest aby specjaliści pracujący z dziećmi i młodzieżą byli świadomi odmienność przebiegu klinicznego ChAD i potrafili postawić właściwą diagnozę z uwzględnieniem kontekstu biologicznego, rozwojowego i systemowego.",

Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to have seizures, practically as two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart or one seizure with a 60% chance of additional seizures. The two overall epilepsy types are generalized and focal. Focal epilepsy most commonly indicates a focal brain injury like traumatic brain injury or tumor. In contrast, generalized epilepsy is due to a genetic etiology, not necessarily inherited. An epilepsy diagnosis is clinically made and can be supported by typical EEG and MRI findings. Nearly 4% of people develop epilepsy, with the largest peak during later years and the second peak during childhood. Nearly 70% of people are seizure-free after five years, whether via control with medications or, less commonly, the epilepsy itself remits. Life expectancy for epilepsy patients is lower. A key contributor to epilepsy mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Uncontrolled generalized tonic clonic seizures are a key risk factor for SUDEP.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

      "title": "The LSD syndrome. A review.",
      "abstract": "lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful bio-active substance related to serotonin in structure. Its actions generally affect autonomic, sensory and psychological functions. Autonomic stimulation is varied. Sensory responses are usually visual, involving heightened and distorted color perception and fusion of sensory impressions. Psychological responses include a feeling that a unique experience is occurring; feelings of depersonalization; pronounced fluctuation of mood; time and space distortions; autistic phenomena; fluctuation of aggressive drives (usually reduction); and spontaneous reoccurrence of the lsd experience. THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES CAN BE RELATED TO THREE BASIC PHENOMENA: (1) expectation; (2) loss of characteristic modes of perceptual and cognitive patterning; and (3) hypersuggestibility. THE MAJOR ADVERSE REACTIONS ARE: (1) chronic drug dependence including subsequent personality changes and depressive reactions; and (2) acute ego dissolution. These reactions usually occur in already emotionally ill people. Most of these users fall into two groups, those with unresolved identity problems and those with severe ego abnormality. The majority of adverse reactions are of the chronic drug dependence type and are usually seen in adolescents and young adults who have not negotiated the age-appropriate tasks of forming and integrating the various identities that are the composite of their life experiences.lsd helps alleviate these stresses via some of its psychological properties as discussed. It also provides a nidus for the formation of a subculture where goals for social, sexual and vocational achievement are lower and idiosyncratic modes of adaptation are better tolerated. A smaller group of users who have serious reactions such as psychosis, rage reactions, homicidal and suicidal ideation are usually found to have preexisting ego abnormality such as ambulatory schizophrenia, chronic impulse disorders and borderline states. Although adverse reactions most often appear to be related to pre-morbid psychopathology, this is not invariably so. Further, there is as yet no reliable method to determine who will have an adverse reaction and what the nature of that reaction will be.",

      "abstract": "Cushing’s syndrome may present with various psychiatric disorders which can lead to a misdiagnosis at the beginning, deterioration of the course of the disease and life-threatening complications. The most common psychiatric disorder is atypical depression. During the initial stages of the disease, the somatic symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome can be subtle, difficult to identify, especially when the psychiatric symptoms are dominant. Objective: The aim of the present article is to report a case of a 24-year-old woman with a Cushing’s syndrome, caused by the adrenal adenoma. The onset of the disease is a suicidal attempt. Family history is significant for psychiatry disorder. The belated diagnosis led to somatic and psychiatry complications of the disease – sepsis and persisting high suicidal risk. The dynamic change in the patient’s mental state – from a severe depressive episode with atypical symptoms to psychosis with single catatonic symptoms – correlated well with the gradual increase of the plasma cortisol levels. The antidepressant and subsequent antipsychotic medication turned out to be ineffective. The surgical treatment, followed by a normalization of the cortisol levels was a key to the successful outcome and the reduction of self-aggression risk. Conclusion: The early diagnosis and timely treatment of Cushing’s syndrome decrease the risk of multiple complications. The shift from atypical depression to psychosis with catatonic symptoms correlates with the worsening of the hormonal imbalance. The signs of atypical depression in Cushing's syndrome, resistant to the antidepressant medication, could be considered as relatively specific symptoms, guiding specialists to its somatogenic origin for the proper diagnosis.",

There has been a long-standing interest in the early-life origins of BD, not least because as many as 50% of adults with BD report onset of their symptoms during childhood and adolescence.1 In this article, we present evidence on the assessment and treatment of BD and related conditions in young people. We also discuss the recent controversy about BD in children and adolescents that has led to the introduction of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM)-5.\n\n### Diagnostic features\n\nBD is characterised by episodes, that is, distinct periods of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During these episodes, patients experience symptoms such as grandiosity, distractibility, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, an increase in activity, flight of ideas and psychomotor agitation. These episodes are required to last by at least 4 days to diagnose hypomania or at least 7 days to diagnose mania. The insistence on episodic mood changes is crucial and prevents clinicians from rating symptoms such as the chronic concentration problems of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as evidence for mania.2 Manic episodes are extremely rare in children and relatively rare in adolescents according to epidemiological studies in the UK and the USA.3\n\n### Acute treatment\n\nPharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute mania. Aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mania in children and adolescents, and olanzapine in approved only for adolescents. A comparative analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials in youth BD established that atypical antipsychotics have better efficacy and tolerability compared with anticonvulsants and lithium (effect size atypical antipsychotics 0.65, CI 0.53 to 0.78 vs …",

It is estimated that more than 21 million people worldwide are diagnosed with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that schizophrenia is probably not related to a single biological factor, but to an interaction of different pathological mechanisms, including intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Patients have three major symptom dimensions, which can be described as positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (affective flattening, alogia, and avolition), and cognitive symptoms (perception, memory, and attention).",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

      "abstract": "Pressure is a thermodynamic variable that, like temperature, affects the states of matter. High pressure is an environmental characteristic of the deep sea. Immersion to depth brings about an increase in pressure of 0.1 MPa (1 atm) for each 10 m of seawater. Humans exposed to high pressure, mostly professional divers, suffer effects that are proportional to their exposure.The nervous system is one of the most sensitive targets of high pressure. The high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) begins to show signs at about 1.3 MPa (120 m) and its effects intensify at greater depths. HPNS starts with tremor at the distal extremities, nausea, or moderate psychomotor and cognitive disturbances. More severe consequences are proximal tremor, vomit, hyperreflexia, sleepiness, and psychomotor or cognitive compromise. Fasciculations and myoclonia may occur during severe HPNS. Extreme cases may show psychosis bouts, and focalized or generalized convulsive seizures. Electrophysiological studies during HPNS display an EEG characterized by reduction of high frequency activity (alpha and beta waves) and increased slow activity, modification of evoked potentials of various modalities (auditory, visual, somatosensory), reduced nerve conduction velocity and changes in latency. Studies using experimental animals have shown that these signs and symptoms are progressive and directly dependent on the pressure. HPNS features at neuronal and network levels are depression of synaptic transmission and paradoxical hyperexcitability.HPNS is associated with exposure to high pressure and its related technological means. Experimental findings suggest etiological hypotheses, prevention and therapeutic approaches for this syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

Le debut partiel est quasi systematique chez le sujet âge mais des crises de toutes sortes, voire plus souvent generalisees sont observees chez le patient dement. Faire un diagnostic d'epilepsie et typer une crise, dans cette population, reste un exercice difficile et se heurte a plusieurs obstacles : l'interrogatoire n'est pas fiable, l'absence de temoin est frequente, la clinique est extremement variee, conduisant a passer a cote de nombreuses crises. Ces dernieres peuvent etre prises pour des problemes d'autres origines, notamment cardiaques, ou pour des symptomes de la demence sous-jacente et vice-versa. Le pourcentage important de crises liees a une situation pathologique, telle qu'un accident vasculaire cerebral a la phase aigue ou la survenue de troubles metaboliques ou toxiques, impose de realiser un bilan etiologique, pour rechercher un facteur intercurrent permettant alors de classer l'evenement en crise symptomatique. Ce n'est pas tant la frequence des crises qui pose probleme generalement, que les consequences medico-sociales nefastes. A moins d'etre en presence d'une crise symptomatique (liee a une cause identifiable) et surtout si la crise se repete au moins une fois, le traitement est conseille.

The presence at this period of life of the highest comorbidity rate, the changes of the central nervous system with ageing, and the particular high frequency of life stressors during this period of life may all explain this. Psychotic symptoms are present in an important number of medical and psychiatric conditions and they make part of psychotic disorders in late life too. The same classification of disorders with psychotic symptoms in adults may be used for older adults. Primary psychotic symptoms exist in persistent psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder), acute psychotic disorder, and personality disorders (paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders). Secondary psychotic symptoms include major and minor neurocognitive disorders, delirium, organic mental disorders, disorders due to psychoactive substance use, bipolar disorders, and depressive episode. Somatic disorders, comorbidities and iatrogenic causes are included at this cluster. Assessment and management of psychosis in older adults at primary care require an organization of the mental health-care system. The management of psychosis in older adults implies the proper use of multidisciplinary therapeutic interventions: pharmacotherapy and psychological, social, and occupational therapy. All forms of stigma and discrimination against older adults with psychosis and their carers should be eliminated.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIn chronic pain syndromes in which no organic pathology or pathophysiological mechanism can be found to account for the pain, i.e. the idiopathic pain syndromes, there is a high frequency of sadness, inner tension and inhibition-retardation. The clinical similarities between the idiopathic pain syndromes and the depressive syndromes have led to the hypothesis that the two syndromes have a common pathogenetic mechanism, that the idiopathic pain syndrome is a masked depression, a special syndrome in a spectrum of depressive diseases or simply a variant of the depressive disorders. In a series of studies, patients with idiopathic pain syndromes have been found to have a high frequency of subjects with affective disorders among their first degree relatives, many have had earlier depressive episodes before the start of the pain syndrome and in about 1/4 of the patients there is a clearcut major affective episode concurrently with the idiopathic pain syndrome. Furthermore, the REM latency in sleep EEG is shortened, there is hypercortisolaemia and a high frequency of pathological dexamethasone suppression tests, low concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA in the C.S.F., low activity of the MAO enzyme in platelets, low 3H-imipramine receptor binding, low concentrations of substance P in the C.S.F., low concentrations of melatonin in serum and urine, high concentrations of endorphins. Fraction 1 in the C.S.F. and low concentrations of dynorphin in the C.S.F. Thus many of the biochemical disturbances usually found in patients with affective disorders are also found in patients with idiopathic pain syndromes and the data today seem to favour the hypothesis that the two syndromes at least have a common pathogenetic mechanism. Among the possible pathogenetic mechanisms found, there is the strongest support for disturbances in the serotonergic systems and thus treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is of great interest.□ Biological markers, Chronic pain, Idiopathic pain, Pathogenesis, Serotonergic disturbances.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "abstract": "Two cases have been studied by means of the usual method for eliciting CNV (S-1.5 OR 1 SEC-S-operant response) during and after the end of an episode of prolonged epileptic twilight state with almost continuous strictly unilateral temporal lobe discharge. From the clinical viewpoint in both cases the twilight state, lasting respectively about 12 and 48 hours, was characterized by a slightly clouded consciousness and moderate impairment of awareness and of psychic performances, at times associated with simple and complex psychomotor automatism and hallucinations. The EEG recorded an almost continous left temporal discharge of pseudorhythmic mixed slow waves and sharps. The third case had typical prolonged petit mal states with continuous spike-and-slow-wave activity, impaired intellectual and motor performances (very long reaction time etc.). In this patient for eliciting ERSPs, besides the standard method, we have used a paradigm in which S consisted of a colored slide, with various semantic contents, remaining visible for 5 seconds on a screen. At the trials of the standard paradigm during the epiliptic twilight state, all patients showed they had understood the signal to interrupt (S loud repetitive tone) in the shortest time possible and could clearly distinguish them from the S. The operant response was almost always made with sufficient precision and sometimes with fairly short reaction time, especially by the patients with temporal psychomotor status. During the episodes of prolonged clouded consciosness in all series of trials administered to the patients, no negative slow potential shifts were observed in the averaged EEG recordings obtained from F-T, F-T or F, FCZ and referred to to linked mastoids. On repetition of the examinations some time after the end of the epileptic twilight state, fairly normal ERSPs were obtained in all cases. Taking also into account the results of previous researches, these studies show that the temporal lobe and \"centrencephalic\" epileptic discharges, under certain conditions, may influence negatively the neurophysiological mechanisms which contribute to the information of complex contingent connections and which also underly the particular attentional, cognitive and sensorimotor functions involved in the inhibiting the appearance of ERSPs probably related to more specific perceptual and integrative functions. Some AA. maintain that negative slow potential shifts express the functional activity of the brain structures, particularly of determined cerebral cortex regions, involved not only in attentional, perceptual, cognitive and psychomotor functioning, but also in information processing (memory recording mechanism). Hence, the negative influence of prolonged temporal lobe or meso-diencephalic epileptic discharges on these structures may explain the almost complete amnesia that patients generally show at the termination of this kind of twilight state.",

The prevalence of bipolar disorder I during a lifetime is about 1%, but, in general, the prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders is significantly more (Hirschfeld, 2001). The prevalence of these disorders is 1-1.6% in the United States, and 1.5-3% around the world (Aghili, 2004). Most patients with bipolar spectrum disorders refer for treatment in a depressive episode and this reason proper diagnosis of the disease is often delayed for about ten years as it was found that given the type of disorder the average time for the treatment is about ten years (Hirschfeld, 2001). Such delays are often associated with undesirable results; patients do not receive appropriate treatment to relieve symptoms and may even receive treatments that exacerbate their symptoms so that they continue inappropriate behaviors which are destructive to themselves and their relatives (Hirschfeld, 2001).",

Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression.

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

      "abstract": "Case Presentation A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being found \"unresponsive\" by his parents. He has been in good general health, has had no fever or other symptoms of infectious processes, has been taking no medications, and was \"his normal self\" until immediately prior to being found. Patients who are unresponsive and unarousable are in coma. The term altered consciousness represents the spectrum of abnormalities that exists between the immediate capability for normal wakefulness and true coma. For the purposes of this review, the two terms will be used interchangeably because their causes are similar and usually differ only in severity. Pathophysiology Two areas of the brain are responsible for consciousness: the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and the cerebral cortex. The ARAS is located in the brain stem from the level of the medulla to the level of the midbrain and sends multiple afferent neurons to the cortex. Disruption of this system can lead to disorders of consciousness. The cerebral cortex is the much more common site where dysfunction can cause coma. Any injury or illness that affects the cerebral cortex globally can cause coma or altered consciousness. Differential Diagnosis Altered consciousness in children can be caused by injuries or illnesses that affect the central nervous system directly or can be a manifestation of other systemic disease (Table 1).",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "title": "Depression and Mania in Patients with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Depression has a major impact on quality of life in patients with epilepsy and is also the main risk factor for the increased suicide rate in epilepsy. The frequency of depressive disorders depends on the severity of epilepsy and the localization of the epileptogenic focus, with a prevalence of ≤50% in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The diagnosis of depression in epilepsy may be difficult because symptoms of depression may be fluctuating, and some symptoms, such as memory complaints, may be misinterpreted as being a consequence of drug treatment or the epilepsy per se. Affective disorders in epilepsy may differ from those seen in patients without epilepsy. A possibility exists that patients with epilepsy will develop a specific interictal dysphoric syndrome related to limbic system dysfunction. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest a bidirectional relation between depression and epilepsy. Depression does not necessarily occur after the onset of epilepsy; the sequence may as well be the other way round, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for both disorders. Classic bipolar disorder type I is rarely seen in epilepsy, and manic episodes occur almost exclusively in the setting of postictal psychosis or after epilepsy surgery. This article explores the clinical manifestations of depressive and manic disorders in epilepsy and the differences from bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are the most frequent clinical conditions seen in practice. Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

As possible comorbidities or triggers we could count on a tonsillitis and/or a depressive reaction a few days before. Serious consideration must be given to a differential diagnosis with an encephalitis but, despite the presence of an intermittent febricula, it was rejected by both units: internal medicine and neurology, after performing some complementary tests, albeit some more specific tests are still pending. His psychiatric background was also checked, which initially was orientated as a questionable bipolar disorder. At all events, symptoms stopped progressively until, almost complete remittance in the moment he was discharged from the hospital. He recovered his normal functionality. The treatment given was risperidon 2 mL/day, quetiapin 50 mg/8 h and baclofen 10 mg/12 h. This can be used as an example of how many difficulties we usually found to catalogue an acute disorder in first phases, even to encompass the clinical profile within the limits of psychiatry or neurology.

      "title": "What is central sleep apnea?",
      "abstract": "Central sleep apnea (CSA) describes a group of conditions in which cessations in air flow occur without respiratory effort. In contrast, obstructive sleep apnea patients have ongoing respiratory effort during respiratory events. However, considerable overlap exists in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnea and CSA. A good working knowledge of the mechanisms underlying CSA is important for optimal clinical care. In general, CSA can be classified into those with excessive drive (eg, Cheyne-Stokes breathing) versus those with inadequate drive (eg, sleep hypoventilation syndrome). One critical factor contributing to the cessation of air flow during sleep is the concept of the apnea threshold, such that a P(aCO(2)) value below a certain level will lead to cessations in breathing. P(aCO(2)) can fall below the chemical apnea threshold when drive is excessive (eg, robust chemosensitivity) or when hyperventilation is occurring (eg, following arousal). Another important factor is the loss of the so-called wakefulness drive to breathe, such that some rise in P(aCO(2)) is likely to occur at the onset of sleep. A variety of factors contribute to this rise, including upper-airway collapse and diminished chemosensitivity (particularly during rapid-eye-movement sleep). In patients with low central drive, this further loss of drive at sleep onset can lead to marked hypercapnia in some cases. The treatment of CSA is also reviewed in some detail, including a role for positive airway pressure (eg, bi-level positive airway pressure in hypoventilation patients) and optimization of medical therapy (eg, in Cheyne-Stokes breathing). A paucity of research exists in this area, emphasizing the opportunities for young investigators who are interested in this field.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

This is a case report of a 26-year-old woman with no previous psychiatric history who presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute psychosis shortly after starting a postprocedural combination of antimicrobials. The patient's family decided to stop the antimicrobials as they observed an escalation of the psychotic symptoms with the ongoing use of antibiotics. The patient was subsequently brought to the emergency service (EMS) department, and she was admitted to the behavioral health unit. The treatment team managed to stabilize the patient with several interventions, including the administration of antianxiety and antipsychotic medications along with psychosocial intervention. The symptoms of psychosis resolved within 3-4 days, and she was discharged home. Even though transient psychotic episodes have been reported previously with antibiotics, this case emphasizes the increased need for vigilance and reporting in patients receiving antimicrobials.",

      "title": "Antipsychotic Drugs: When and How to Withdraw Them?",
      "abstract": "One of the great conundrums in modern medicine is how to target medicines so that they exert the maximum benefits in assisting the body to recover fully and stably from illnesses without contributing to added impairment or disability. This problem is increased when the drugs under question have a potent effect on the control of distressing symptoms of major disorders. The case of antipsychotic medicine for schizophrenic disorders highlights such difficulties for the clinician. There is overwhelming evidence from double-blind controlled trials that the pharmacotherapy for acute psychotic episodes as well as the prevention of subsequent episodes is extremely beneficial, has low mortality and relatively low morbidity [1]. However, as with most treatments, it is also very clear that not every person diagnosed with these syndromes benefits equally, and that a substantial percentage show minimal if any benefit [2]. This latter group may be divided into two subgroups: (A) those cases who recover from a psychotic disorder without any pharmacotherapy, and (B) those in whom psychotic symptoms persist despite the best efforts to provide optimal pharmacotherapy. Epidemiological studies indicate that this first group varies from 5 to 60%, with an overall average of around 25% [2, 3]. Remarkably this proportion has remained fairly constant for over 100 years, with variability being attributed more to social than to medical factors [2,3,4]. The second group of medication-resistant cases would appear to have benefited from recent developments in pharmacotherapy, especially the wider use of clozapine, which has been considered to have benefits for up to one third of this group, thereby reducing the proportion from around 30 to 20%. Thus, it may be concluded that about half the cases of schizophrenic disorders benefit clinically from optimal pharmacotherapy. Such a conclusion may seem pessimistic, but it should be noted that compared with pharmacotherapy in other branches of medicine, this is an extremely high rate of benefit. It is estimated that most highly successful medical treatments have specific benefits for around one third of cases.The problem that psychiatry has faced, but not yet resolved, is how to select those cases who will benefit from pharmacological treatment, and those who will benefit from non-pharmacological treatments or combinations of both these approaches. Preliminary studies suggested that group A patients who are likely to have a benign course are those with an acute onset, often triggered by major life stress or substance abuse, with good pre-morbid social functioning and supportive relationships [5,6,7]. Recent interest has focused on early detection and intervention with pharmacotherapy, but the benefits have all too often been attributed to initiating early pharmacotherapy, rather than the confounding effects of these good prognostic factors that are clearly likely to promote early treatment [6, 8]. Unfortunately there is also substantial evidence to suggest that while it may provide rapid suppression of acute psychotic symptoms, early continuous pharmacotherapy may delay full and lasting recovery in a proportion of these cases [9,10,11,12,13,14,15].Psychosocial treatments that exert their effects through stress management strategies that help patients and their caregivers to cope with distressing and confusing symptoms as well as to deal more efficiently with current and future life stresses have proven successful in decreasing the short- to medium-term morbidity of schizophrenic disorders when combined with optimal pharmacotherapy [16, 17]. A small number of trials that have not employed the highest quality methodology have suggested that the provision of very intensive psychosocial support in homely environments may be as effective as antipsychotic medicine in the relief of the first acute psychotic episodes of young patients [16,17,18,19]. Approximately half the patients in these studies showed a good outcome without receiving antipsychotic medication. However, these groups were self-selected and the majority of non-drug responders probably represented group A with good prognostic features or were cases with psychotic symptoms that did not meet the full criteria for schizophrenia. Furthermore, other forms of sedative drugs such as benzodiazepines were used for many of these cases, and controlled trials have demonstrated that these medicines are effective antipsychotics for acute episodes [20]. Follow-ups of the 'non-neuroleptic' cohorts have shown that they generally have a somewhat better social outcome than those who received conventional neuroleptics [16, 18, 19]. Early prospective placebo-controlled studies of antipsychotics did indeed indicate that a substantial minority recovered well from their acute psychotic episodes while receiving only inactive preparations [9]. The proportions of symptom-free cases were very similar to those reported in the epidemiological studies prior to the introduction of modern neuroleptic drugs [21,22,23]. Of course all these studies included cases that would not now be diagnosed as schizophrenia.It is erroneous to conclude from the extant data, however, that treatment with neuroleptics to promote remission of acute psychotic episodes is harmful, either in the short term or in preventing full and lasting clinical and social recovery. A series of epidemiological studies in developing countries where neuroleptic drugs were used in acute episodes, but were usually withdrawn once these episodes were resolved showed long-term outcomes at least as good as those reported in the intensive psychosocial/'no neuroleptic' cohorts described above [24,25,26,27]. This paradoxical effect has not been fully elucidated, but one hypothesis is that a supportive social environment with encouragement to continue participation in all aspects of community life may assist in the recovery process. Thus, it would seem reasonable to consider that all patients experiencing their first acute psychotic episode have a trial of antipsychotic medication. However, it may be equally important to provide a highly supportive psychosocial environment, and wherever possible to withhold medications for a period to observe the benefits of the psychosocial programme on the patients' clinical state for at least 48 h [28]. This also allows any toxic drug- or stress-induced effects to begin to resolve. But it would be dangerous to assume that all cases who respond in this period have drug- or stress-induced episodes. The response to supportive nursing care and placebo pharmacological effects would account for a high proportion of such cases. Of course those cases who have had persisting psychotic symptoms for a considerable period before receiving specialised psychiatric treatment would not be likely to show dramatic improvements either with psychosocial or pharmacological interventions, and it may be months or even years before the full benefits of any pharmacotherapy will be observed [29]. For this reason such cases are often prematurely dubbed 'treatment resistant' after only several weeks of acute pharmacological interventions in the absence of any effective psychosocial strategies.The nub of the issue is not whether or not antipsychotic drugs are useful in helping to resolve acute psychotic episodes, but whether all cases of schizophrenic disorders benefit from continuation after they have recovered from all their symptoms, and at what point is it advantageous to discontinue them in a pharmacologically sound manner. The remainder of this paper will attempt to address these issues, and highlight current knowledge as well as future research questions that may clarify this important issue.Overall the evidence that antipsychotic medicines can be successfully withdrawn is highly pessimistic [30,31,32]. However, this is not surprising, because most studies have been conducted on people in the sub-acute phase of recovery from a major psychotic episode, when they have regained some stability in their conditions, but have had significant residual psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms and have been under substantial life stress in their efforts to return to life in the community. The evidence is very clear that at this point withdrawal from effective medication is extremely hazardous and common sense would predict that exacerbations are highly likely. Furthermore, because exacerbations have been defined as any sign of deterioration in the clinical state both minor and major exacerbations of both psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms, as well as withdrawal responses have been defined as treatment failure. The results are much less pessimistic when only major exacerbations, usually requiring re-admission to hospital, have been used as the criteria [32, 33]. In addition, withdrawal has usually involved double-blind immediate change from active to placebo medication; a procedure that would be considered poor practice by most clinicians to the extent that today it is extremely difficult to obtain ethical approval for such studies [34]. Baldessarini and his team have also demonstrated that when withdrawal has been conducted in a more gradual manner, following sound pharmacological principles, the rate of exacerbation has been significantly lower, approaching levels that would appear acceptable in clinical practice [35]. It is also important to acknowledge that even under optimal pharmacological treatment around 40% of patients will suffer major recurrences or exacerbations within the 1st year after an acute psychotic episode and around 60% within 2 years [36]. These rates do not appear to be substantially lower in first episode cases [37, 38]. When optimal pharmacotherapy is integrated with continued psychosocial stress management programmes this rate is reduced consistently by about 20% [36].It is evident that the period of maximum vulnerability to exacerbations is in the first 6 months after a hospital admission for an acute psychotic episode, when residual symptoms are usually present and re-entry stress is very high [10, 31,37,38,39,40,41,42]. It may be concluded that during this phase the protective benefits of antipsychotic medication are maximal, although it is crucial to ensure that dosages are optimal (i.e. minimally effective doses) so that any extra-biological and psychosocial stresses from side-effects are avoided. It could be argued that patients who have remained symptom free for 6 months after a major psychotic episode and have re-established their lifestyles may be considered for a trial of carefully managed medication withdrawal. Needless to say this opinion is often shared by the patients themselves, who feeling well again, begin to conduct their own withdrawal experiments without the expert advise of their prescribing physicians, usually stopping taking their medication abruptly, or even worse taking drugs sporadically.However, it would be wrong to assume from the extant data that patients who are asymptomatic on medications for 6 months or more will remain well when confronted with the biological stress associated with their withdrawal, even when this is conducted in a gradual way. Prognostic indicators that are more sensitive than overt symptoms may prove useful in determining whether vulnerability to exacerbations remains at a high level. Promising indicators include physiological arousal [43], environmental stress and coping factors [5, 44, 45]. The link between poor adherence to pharmacotherapy and recurrent episodes may be, at least partially, associated with impaired cognitive functioning in the early phase of a recurrence contributing to irregular compliance [46]. Hence measures of cognitive functioning may serve to detect increased vulnerability before symptomatic impairments become evident, and a fall-off in adherence to tablet taking may be a simple indicator of this. However, at present most of these measures require refinement and/or simplification before they can be useful in clinical practice. Thus, the best indicator probably remains the presence of residual psychopathology, and in particular the re-emergence of the characteristic features that precede an exacerbation for each individual [47, 48]. This careful monitoring by patients, key carers, case managers and psychiatrists is a core aspect of educational self-management interventions, that together with carer-based stress management training are now considered treatments of choice for all patients recovering from schizophrenic disorders [49, 50].To date the hypothesis outlined above has not been formally tested. Two studies involving recent onset cases both withdrew medication abruptly with substitution with placebos in a double-blind manner in symptom-free patients after 18 months of continued medication after an acute episode [32, 51]. In both studies exacerbation rates were high and almost all patients had their medicines restored after no more than a few months on placebo. However, neither study employed the educational and stress management procedures that have proven effective in the prevention of exacerbations.A third pilot study that employed continued integrated pharmacotherapy and extensive psychosocial treatments withdrew medicines gradually in patients who had been clinically stable for 24 months after an acute episode [52]. During the subsequent year that patients and caregivers monitored their early warning signs and continued regular structured problem solving, not one of the 12 cases experienced any exacerbations or deterioration in their social functioning. This small cohort represented two thirds of the entire sample and half were first episode cases. It should be noted that 24 months free of significant symptoms is a far cry from 6 months, and that the continued training in stress management (comprising structured problem solving and monitoring stress levels) throughout 2 years was possibly the key ingredient that enabled these cases to control their biological and environmental vulnerability factors. Without long-term training in the self-management of all types of environmental stress, continuation of pharmacotherapy appears necessary to prevent major symptom exacerbations. Although following similar principles but using somewhat different training methods, less structured psychosocial programmes have reported good outcomes in the absence of continued pharmacotherapy [16,17,18,19]. It is clear that we have extremely limited research on his important issue, and that no clear guidelines can be offered at present.The time appears long overdue to examine when and how to withdraw medicines from patients who may no longer benefit from them, or may never have benefited from them. Despite the good safety record of antipsychotics they do have a high risk of morbidity [53, 54] and a small risk of mortality [55, 56]. In the continuing absence of adequate studies to enable us to target pharmacotherapy in the 50% of cases who will derive specific benefits, most clinical guidelines assume that all people suffering a psychotic episode should receive these potent drugs for the rest of their lives. For those with persisting psychotic symptoms it may be argued that they function as sedative agents that reduce the distress of continued psychosis. However, newer psychosocial treatments now offer an alternative method of achieving this objective, and in a proportion of cases also contribute to clinically significant reductions in symptoms [52, 57]. As yet no study has withdrawn antipsychotic medication from patients with medication-resistant persisting psychosis. Furthermore, it is likely that lasting benefits from cognitive-behavioural interventions will only be achieved when patients learn to apply these psychosocial strategies in a competent manner, and when they receive continued monitoring and further intensive training in a long-term maintenance programme, similar to that provided for effective pharmacotherapy.In conclusion, a sequential approach to the long-term clinical management of schizophrenic disorders that integrates biomedical and psychosocial strategies is proposed. After initial intensive pharmacotherapy and stress management achieves remission of acute psychotic symptoms, doses of antipsychotics are lowered to minimally effective levels and combined with training in psychosocial stress management until a full and stable recovery from all symptoms of schizophrenia is achieved. Stable recovery is defined as 12 months free of symptoms for first episode cases and 24 months for recurrent episodes. At this stage both medication and psychosocial interventions are slowly withdrawn with close monitoring. Boosters of both types of interventions are targeted to periods when warning signs of impending exacerbations or stressful life crises threaten patients' continued mental health [48]. This latter targeted approach has not been adequately studied in stable remitted cases, where it may be a viable alternative to continued medication [58]. Such a sequential approach is straightforward, but requires a dedicated and well-trained team, that currently is seldom available in mental health services. Schizophrenia is a major public health problem that merits such dedicated and sophisticated treatment approaches that may improve the recovery rate from the 15–25% that has not changed for more than a century [2,3,4] to the 40–50% rates obtained in those preliminary studies that have integrated minimally effective doses of antipsychotics with extensive training in stress management [16,17,18,19, 52], thereby replicating the common practice of managing these disorders in developing countries where similar recovery rates have been observed [24, 25]. Well-controlled research studies are essential to further our understanding of these apparently optimal treatment strategies that are now recommended in most clinical practice guidelines [49, 50].",

      "title": "Comparison of Language Disorders in Psychotic Disorder (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Drug-Induced Psychosis)",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe term refers to many diverse behavioral forms which are not in connection with reality. In other words, the person exhibiting psychotic behavior has weird and extraordinary thoughts and perceptions about whatever happens. Such behavior might include delusions and/or hallucinations (Haljyn and Cross Vytbvrn, 2003). In the 5th statistical and diagnostic manual of psychological disorders, the five principal categories were omitted. The respective categories were labeled as a single class entitled Schizophrenic and Other Psychotic Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2004). Schizophrenia is the most substantial disorder faced by the psychiatry. Schizophrenia mainly turns the most fertile and constructive living years of the patients into inability due to its prevalence age (i.e., early adulthood) and extensive complications (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). The following figures have been reported for prevalence of mental disorders in USA: schizophrenia 1%, schizophrenia form 0.2%, schizoaffective 0.5%, and delusion and joint psychiatric disorder and other psychotic disorders approximately 0.025 per each disease case (Caplan, 1994). Individuals suffering from schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders often exhibit abnormal language damages (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004) such that speech disturbances are considered among the major symptoms in diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Vita et al., 1995).Melinder and Barch (2003) described at least two types of language damages (of course, not necessarily separate) in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The first type is thought disorder or failure in maintaining a speech plan which is in turn divided into two branches: formal thought disorder and negative thought disorder. The second type of these damages is schizophrenia which includes variety of traumas such as neologism, incomprehensible speeches or clang association. In formal thought disorder, the speech of the schizophrenic individual has anomalies in semantic rules as well as forming style of language, and, the sentences are obscurely linked. Symptoms like improper repetitions, tangentially, missing the goal, mistake in reference of the pronoun, and neologism are observed in this group. Negative thought disorder is characterized by reduction in syntactic complexities and speech volume. The speech of the patient becomes concise and short such that the vocabulary treasure seems small. This branch of thought disorder differs from disruptions in oral expression, syntactic complexity, and natural hesitations and pauses (Raisi, and Mahmoudi Salmani, 2004). Many unanswered questions have been posed concerning speech and language disorders of psychotic patients. Language is regarded as the most intricate mind product that influences nearly all high-level mind activities i.e., perception, determination, conception, cognition, thought, reasoning, judgment, imagination, problem solving, and even emotions and personality growth. From another aspect, language is the only means to assess major disorder i.e., thought disorder in the respective patients (Parva, Mazinani, A'shayeri, and Javadi-Khomami, 2004). Furthermore, other attitudes consider the major disorder in schizophrenic patients as a language disorder. For instance, CHAIKA in 1974 (quoted by GOURREN 1996) holds the opinion that psychotic patients suffer from an alternating aphasia on which they have no control (Zarrella, 1995). ZAS (1993) believes it is wrong to infer that the respective patients have thought disorder solely based on their language as schizophrenic and psychotic patients- unlike the aphasia patients - have no problem in their expression and in fact the listener has difficulty in understanding their words (Willig, 1998). Language disorders have been popularly recognized from long times ago but such disorders have particularly attracted attraction of psychologists and linguists during the recent decades (Talebi Nejad, 1993). …",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "title": "A complex polymorphous psychosis or a cycloid psychosis with a different onset?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute and transitory psychotic disorders comprise a polymorphous picture such as Leonhard’s cycloid psychoses, which alternate episodes of affective symptoms such as psychosis between two poles (anguish/happiness, incoherence/stupor, or akinesia/hyperkinesia). Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

Two boys had episodes of abnormal behavior in hypnagogic-and occasionally hypnopompic-periods for 1 year from the time they were 1 year and several months old. The episodes consisted of irregular body movements, which could be either gentle or violent but never made the children get out of bed. They lasted from a few seconds to 2 hours and were associated with poor reactivity and amnesia of the events. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed wake-state features, with brief bursts of hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and did not display seizure activity. A distinctive behavior disorder occurring during wake-sleep transitions with a wake EEG pattern has been identified in very early childhood. The clinical profile does not fit any of the known parasomnias and might belong to a new category of parasomnia.",

      "title": "Cytokines, stress and depressive illness: brain‐immune interactions",
      "abstract": "Cytokines, signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated as a contributing factor for mood disorders such as depression. Several lines of evidence supporting this contention are briefly reviewed and caveats are introduced. Essentially, a relationship between cytokines and depression is based on the findings that: 1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1, interleukin‐6, tumor necrosis factor‐α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment, 2) cytokines induce neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes reminiscent of those implicated in depression, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors, 3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by signs of immune activation and by elevations of cytokine production or levels, and 4) immunotherapy, using interleukin‐2 or interferon‐α, promotes depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is argued that cytokine synthesis and release, elicited upon activation of the inflammatory response system, provoke neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Furthermore, such effects are subject to a sensitization effect so that a history of stressful experiences or cytokine activation augment the response to later challenges and hence the evolution of depression",

      "abstract": "Background Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) is a severe form of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures (GEFS+). SMEI is a rare disorder characterized by generalized tonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic seizures that are initially induced by fever and begin during the first year of life. Later, patients also manifest other seizure types, including absence, myoclonic, and simple and complex partial seizures. Psychomotor development stagnates around the second year of life. SME is considered to be the most severe phenotype within the spectrum of GEFS+. SME is a malignant epileptic syndrome, while GEFS+ is usually benign. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is observed with GEFS+. SCN1A-related seizure disorders encompass a spectrum that ranges from simple febrile seizures (FS) and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICE-GTC) at the severe end Patients and methods 87 infants representing GEFS+ were analyzed by bidirectional sequencing of all exons of the SCN1A, SCN2A, GABRG2 or SCN1B genes. Additionally, MLPA analysis of SCN1A was performed. Results In 36 patients with disease causing mutations were characterized. 34 mutations were found in SCN1A and two in GABRG2. 9 mutations were found in relatives. Discussion The majority of the patients presenting with missense mutations had a less severe form of GEFS+. In all but one case the mutation positive relatives belong to this group. The majority of the relatives had no phenotypic manifestations. The patients with nonsense, splice site or frameshift mutations or large deletions had phenotypes in the SMEI end of the clinical spectra. All but 2 of the missense mutations were new. Mutations giving rise to the SMEI phenotype represent de novo incidences.",

On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare.

      "title": "Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by two components: recurrent panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: The term “predementia syndrome” identifies all conditions with age-related deficits in cognitive function reported in the literature, including a mild stage of cognitive impairment based on a normality model and pathological conditions considered predictive or early stages of dementia.1,2 Such predementia syndromes have been defined for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but have not yet been operationalized for vascular dementia (VaD) and other specific forms of dementia. Therefore, the term “predementia syndromes” includes different conditions, and of these predementia syndromes, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most widely used term to indicate older persons without dementia with no significant disability and mild memory or cognitive impairment that cannot be accounted for by any recognized medical or psychiatric condition.1,2 Predementia syndrome is, therefore, an umbrella term that includes also the preclinical phase of dementia of numerous rating scales developed for staging dementia (i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5 or “questionable dementia”).1 There is now ample evidence that MCI is often a pathology-based condition with a high rate of progression to AD.1,2 Therefore, MCI, and particularly amnestic MCI (aMCI) was also identified as the predementia syndrome for AD. The more recently proposed multiple subtypes of MCI were intended to reflect the heterogeneity of different types of dementia. Actually, the recent subclassification of MCI according to its cognitive features (dysexecutive MCI and aMCI or aMCI and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI): single domain aMCI and multiple domain aMCI or single domain naMCI, and multiple domain naMCI), clinical presentation (MCI with parkinsonism, or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), or depressive symptoms, or behavioral and psychological symptoms) or likely etiology (MCI-AD, vascular MCI, or MCI-Lewy body dementia) represents an attempt to control this heterogeneity.1,2 In particular, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders that share a presumed vascular cause.3 In 2003, it was hypothesized that people with VCI have a specific cognitive profile in which memory is preserved and executive function impaired.4 Within the VCI construct, the parallel condition to MCI is VCI–no dementia (VCI-ND) or vascular predementia MCI, defined as the clinical phenotype of cognitive impairment of a presumed vascular cause that is not severe enough to meet the criteria for dementia.3 NaMCI can, in some cases, be vascular in origin, and other subtypes of MCI can progress to VCI.3 The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) found that, in elderly people with VCI-ND, low scores on tests of memory and semantic category fluency predicted incident cases of dementia (VaD and AD combined) 5 years later. Most of these incident cases had VaD.5 Other groups have also shown that reductions in memory, as part of a more global pattern of impairment, precede diagnoses of VaD and AD by up to 4 years.3,6 In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), in 2,963 individuals from a population-based sample, it was found that, in a predementia syndrome with a cognitive pattern similar to AD and with a central role for memory decline (aMCI), in those who progressed to dementia, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD or VCI.6 Recently, in the CSHA, in people with no cognitive impairment at baseline, abstract reasoning was considerably worse in those who developed VCI than in those who developed AD and had memory impairment.7 These results suggest the existence of a preclinical phase of VCI (VCI-ND) during which widespread but subtle executive dysfunction plus memory impairment may be detected some years before a clinical diagnosis can be rendered. Beyond controlling the established vascular risk factors for stroke, prevention of VCI-ND might be possible through physical activity.8 In another recent community-based study, the Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), involving 205 older subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 75.3), 164 subjects with normal cognition (CDR=0) and 41 with cognitive impairment without dementia or “questionable dementia” (CDR=0.5), after 1.6 years of follow-up, 33 (16.1%) had experienced cognitive decline. After controlling for age, education, and cognitive function, cognitive decline was predicted by urinary albumin excretion rates, whereas the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) appeared protective.9 The authors correctly acknowledged that blood pressure lowering has been shown to be effective in preventing stroke-related dementia (i.e., VCI), but the data on AD are conflicting,10 although the possible protective effect of ACEIs or ARBs may occur independently of blood pressure lowering. Given this evidence and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the whole FDS sample, it seems reasonable to postulate that the cognitive impairment without dementia identified with a CDR of 0.5 may be particularly due to vascular pathology (VCI-ND). In conclusion, we strongly suggest a vascular origin for the cognitive impairment without dementia predicted by microalbuminuria and ACEIs or ARBs in the FDS, with a clinical phenotype compatible with VCI-NA. These findings suggest new possible predictors of VCI-ND, beyond reported executive dysfunction plus memory impairment and physical activity.7,8 Conflict of Interest: The editor in chief has reviewed the conflict of interest checklist provided by the authors and has determined that the authors have no financial or any other kind of personal conflicts with this letter.

      "abstract": "Abstract The cauda equina is a collection of peripheral nerves in the common dural sheath within the lumbar spinal canal. Cauda equina syndrome, also known as bilateral acute radicular syndrome, usually is caused by a large, sequestered acute disc rupture at L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 that produces partial or complete lesions of the cauda equina–lower motor neuron lesions associated with flaccid paralysis, atrophy, and other conditions. Patients usually present with a history of back symptoms that have worsened precipitously. The syndrome includes back pain, bilateral leg pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, urinary bladder retention, and lax rectal tone. Cauda equina syndrome is rated using Diagnosis-related estimates (DRE) lumbosacral categories VI or VII. Category VI, Cauda Equina–like Syndrome Without Bowel or Bladder Signs, is used when there is permanent bilateral partial loss of lower extremity function but no bowel or bladder impairment. Category VII, Cauda Equina Syndrome with Bowel or Bladder Impairment, is similar to Category VI but also includes bowel or bladder impairment. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ) uses the term cauda equina syndrome with reference to both the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine regions; this usage is unique to the AMA Guides but maintains the internal consistency of the Injury Model, which is the best approach to date for assessing spine impairment.",

The patients differ from those of the previous group in that during their lucid intervals they pass as normal sane individuals. They are, however, liable to become so far out of accord with an environment which would have little or no influence on normal individuals, that attacks of temporary mental alienation develop at regular or irregular intervals. In other words, the mental equilibrium of these patients is so unstable that it becomes upset by the various influences which constitute the normal “stress” to which the several members of a civilised community are necessarily subject. Though the cases in this group grade insensibly into and, during their attacks, exhibit a mental symptomatology similar to that of those included in Group II, classes ( a ) and ( b ), the fact that they are sane during a greater or a lesser portion of their lives affords a sufficient reason for placing them in a separate group as one of the types of high-grade amentia.",

Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1).

Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

Depending on quantity of psychopathological syndromes including from the list a-b F20, monoand polymorphic clinical structure of an attack was allocated. To the monomorphic structure of depressive SCHAD there were attributed the attacks, which clinical picture was settled with verbal hallucination, considerably rare, on the material of the present investigation with delirium register of psychopathic symptomatology. Polymorphic structure of depressive SCHAD is characterized by verbal hallucination (in the form of main syndrome register) in a combination with episodes of acute sensual delirium, visual-figurative delirium of imagination, separate manifestations of mental automatism syndrome, delirium episodes with a plot of intermetamorphosis, symbolic meaning, damage, injury, imaginary pregnancy, confabulative delusion.",

      "abstract": "Chronic mania is a mental health disorder that has been described by various psychiatrists in the past but currently is not a part of nosology. Robust epidemiological data for chronic mania are lacking with regard to its prevalence and clinical features. The present case report is of a 48-year-old male with a six-year history of mood and psychotic symptoms, based on which differential diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder (manic type), schizophrenia, and mania with psychotic symptoms (with chronic course) were made. The diagnosis of chronic mania was confirmed considering the predominance of fluctuating mood symptoms along with psychotic symptoms, lack of remission, and chronic course of illness. Antipsychotics were initially started for six weeks, to which the patient demonstrated a minimal response. A mood stabilizer was added to the regimen, leading to significant improvement, and the patient was discharged. According to existing literature, patients with chronic mania present with severe illness, the presence of psychotic symptoms, and socio-occupational impairment, which was also noticed in this case. The prevalence of chronic mania among patients with bipolar disorder is approximately 13-15%, which constitutes a significant proportion of known mental illnesses. Therefore, chronic mania should be added as a distinct clinical entity in the existing nosological systems.",

      "abstract": "Chronische Insomnie, d. h. Klagen über Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen, frühmorgendliches Erwachen und damit verbundene Beeinträchtigung der Befindlichkeit während des Tages betreffen etwa 10 % der Bevölkerung in den meisten westlichen Industrienationen. Ursächlich für chronische Schlaflosigkeit können körperliche Erkrankungen, psychische Erkrankungen, die Einnahme von Medikamenten, Genussmittel oder Drogen sein. Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden. Die kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutischen Techniken der Insomniebehandlung können von darin geschulten Ärzten und Psychotherapeuten mit Erfolg eingesetzt werden.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

      "title": "EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A CHILD WITH FEBRILE SEIZURE",
      "abstract": "Febrile seizures (FS) are self-limiting and benign convulsions associated with fever, affecting children from 6 months to 5 years of age, most commonly in children between 12-18 months of age and last only few minutes. The international League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines FS as “a seizure in association with a febrile illness in the absence of a central nervous system infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children older than a month of age without prior afebrile seizures”. There are simple and complex FS. A simple FS is a generalized clonic or tonic-clonic seizure, lasts less than 15 minutes and is not caused by brain infection or any other brain disease. While a complex FS is a focal or prolonged seizure and lasts more than 15 minutes. The child, either with a simple or complex FS is neurologically healthy. Evaluation of a child with febrile seizure includes medical history, family history of FS or epilepsy, physical examination, recent antibiotic therapy, recent immunization and day care attendance. Physical examination reveals normal neurological status as well as normal development of the child. In addition, signs for meningitis or encephalitis should be excluded during physical examination (e.g. stiff neck, altered consciousness). The prevalence of meningitis in children with FS is reported to be 1-2%. Management of a child with a febrile seizure includes maneuvers for cessation of seizure used as an acute phase treatment and evaluating the child for the etiology of the fever. Acute phase treatment includes appropriate lateral posturing with head extension, keeping airways open and administration of rectal diazepam. Intravenous diazepam is administrated while the child in the emergency room with a complex FS or febrile status epilepticus. When administration of intravenous diazepam is not possible, buccal midazolam is reported to be more useful than rectal diazepam. For a child with FS specific laboratory studies are not indicated except laboratory studies indicated by the underlying illness. For example in a child with diarrhea and vomiting laboratory studies for electrolytes are indicated and beneficial. Lumbar puncture (LP) is considered in children younger than 18 months because meningeal signs may be absent or subtle in this age group, while in children older than 18 months LP is considered only when there is a suspicion of meningitis. Brain MRI or CT is indicated in a child with FS if there is an increased intracranial pressure and history of trauma or a possible neurologic abnormality. Studies have not found electroencephalography (EEG) to be helpful in predicting the development of later afebrile seizure or epilepsy and that majority of these children have a normal EEG. For a child with a simple febrile seizure consultation with a neuropediatrician is rarely needed. In healthy children the consequences of FS are rare. As a first line therapy in a febrile child, antipyretics may be used as a symptomatic treatment after FS. However there is no reported evidence for prevention or decrease of FS when using antipyretics at the onset of fever. The use of neuroleptics or benzodiazepines after a simple FS currently is not recommended because of associated adverse effects, even though their use is reported to be effective in reducing the FS. However, if prevention of FS were essential oral diazepam would be used, because it is intermittent and has less adverse effects.",

Deux grands types de plainte peuvent être opposés. La plainte suspecte de révéler une ma traduit un trouble de la mémorisation : les difficultés ne portent que sur le passé récent, elles retentissent rapidement sur la vie quotidienne et s’accompagnent de modifications du comportement qui amènent l’entourage à demander la consultation. Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage.

      "title": "The significance of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)",
      "abstract": "Long COVID is now well accepted as an ongoing post-viral syndrome resulting from infection of a single virus, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. It mirrors the post-viral fatigue syndrome, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a global debilitating illness arising mainly from sporadic geographically-specific viral outbreaks, and from community endemic infections, but also from other stressors. Core symptoms of both syndromes are post-exertional malaise (a worsening of symptoms following mental or physical activity), pervasive fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), and sleep disturbance. Long COVID patients frequently also suffer from shortness of breath, relating to the lung involvement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is no universally accepted pathophysiology, or recognized biomarkers yet for Long COVID or indeed for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Clinical case definitions with very similar characteristics for each have been defined. Chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disrupted energy production in the peripheral system has been confirmed in Long COVID and has been well documented in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Neuroinflammation occurs in the brain in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as shown from a small number of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, and has now been demonstrated for Long COVID. Oxidative stress, an increase in reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and free radicals, has long been suggested as a potential cause for many of the symptoms seen in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, resulting from both activation of the brain’s immune system and dysregulation of mitochondrial function throughout the body. The brain as a high producer of energy may be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. It has been shown in peripheral immune cells that the balanced production of proteins involved in regulation of the reactive oxygen species in mitochondria is disturbed in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Fluctuations in the chronic low level neuroinflammation during the ongoing course of Long COVID as well as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome have been proposed to cause the characteristic severe relapses in patients. This review explores oxidative stress as a likely significant contributor to the pathophysiology of Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and the mechanisms by which oxidative stress could cause the symptoms seen in both syndromes. Treatments that could mitigate oxidative stress and thereby lessen the debilitating symptoms to improve the life of patients are discussed.",

Es un son no reparador, amb consequencies diurnes com la fatiga, la irritabilitat o la disminucio de l’alerta, que afecta tant la vida social com laboral de l’individu. Dels diferents trastorns primaris del son, l’etiologia dels quals no es deguda a una malaltia mental, medica o a cap substancia, l’insomni primari te una prevalenca mitjana a la poblacio del 30%. Historicament el tractament farmacologic de l’insomni ha tingut com a principal diana el receptor GABA(A). L’evolucio dels hipnotics que actuen sobre aquest receptor, ha aportat una millora en la seva eficacia i seguretat. Tot i aixi, encara tenen efectes no desitjats com l’insomni de rebot, la dependencia, l’amnesia anterograda o la tolerancia. El nostre objectiu es trobar un candidat que millori els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals. Seguint una estrategia de cribratge, seleccionar un compost amb: 1) major selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat ?1 del receptor GABA(A), implicada en el son, 2) activitat hipnotica in vivo que no alteri l’arquitectura del son i 3) una absorcio oral rapida i vida mitjana adequada. Dels 1214 compostos que es van cribrar en total, dos van presentar una elevada selectivitat in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A) major que la del zolpidem, el farmac de referencia mes selectiu que hi ha actualment al mercat. Aquesta selectivitat in vitro dels compostos, es correlaciona amb la selectivitat in vivo, de manera que els compostos mes selectius per la subunitat alfa-1 in vitro, son tambe els que indueixen sedacio in vivo sense efectes no desitjats com la relaxacio muscular associada a la subunitat alfa-2 del receptor GABA(A) Pero l’efecte in vivo no depen nomes de l’afinitat del compost pel receptor, sino tambe del nombre de receptors que el compost ocupa al teixit diana i de la seva eficacia intrinseca per activar-los i generar una resposta biologica. L’ocupacio de receptors s’ha analitzat en estudis ex-vivo i s’ha relacionat amb l’efecte observat en els assaigs de comportament in vivo. Quan es determina l’ocupacio ex-vivo del receptor GABA(A) per part dels compostos en determinades arees del cervell, on predomina una determinada subunitat del receptor, els compostos amb mes afinitat per la subunitat alfa-1 que indueixen sedacio a dosi mes baixa, tambe son els que per norma general requereixen menys dosi per assolir el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo dels receptors a cerebel (on predomina la subunitat alfa-1 implicada en sedacio). En el mateix sentit, els compostos menys afins per alfa-2 que requereixen una dosi mes alta per induir relaxacio muscular, son tambe els que per norma general assoleixen el 50% d’ocupacio ex-vivo a medul•la (on predomina la subunitat alfa-2) a una dosi mes gran. Les dades d’ocupacio ex-vivo a cerebel corroboren l’afinitat dels compostos in vitro per la subunitat alfa-1 del receptor GABA(A). En base als resultats presentats en la present Tesi Doctoral, es conclou que s’ha generat i seleccionat un candidat que podria millorar els inconvenients dels hipnotics actuals en els estudis preclinics.",

      "title": "Kronična migrena kao socioekonomski problem današnjice",
      "abstract": "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling primary headache with the prevalence in the world between 0.9 to 5.1%. It is defined by ICHD-3 criteria as headache that lasts 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months while an 8 days headache per month fulfills the criteria for migraine. CM is typically a progressive episodic migraine (EM), ranging 2.5 – 3 % per year, with a slowly increase in headache frequency and migraine associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). There are several risk factors that increase the risk of transformation in CM. One of them is the excessive use of medication, which initiated the discussion regarding the causal or consequential association with CM or with chronic daily headache (CDH). It is believed that CM is, among the four types of CDH, the most debilitating type of long duration CDH (the duration of seizures ≥4 hours), and also a most common form of CDH. Compared with episodic migraine, patients with CM have a significantly lower productivity and more frequent absences from work, school, social activities, and generally reduced quality of life. Also, compared to EM, CM patients visit physicians more often, either due to primary disease, or because of numerous comorbidities. It is estimated that the total cost is four times higher than in patients with EM. Pathophysiologically, frequent headache attacks induce pain modulation system and anatomical damage. As the frequency of headaches rises, the recovery of neurological functions between headache episodes becomes less sufficient. Unfortunately, CM is often an undiagnosed and untreated disorder. In therapy, multidisciplinary approach is essential. In addition to the mandatory prophylactic treatment for reducing migraine attacks, it is necessary to decrease risk factors and comorbidities and also to limit the intake of acute symptomatic drugs. ----- The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of socioeconomic aspect of CM through the comparison with EM, underlining the importance of risk factors in transformation into the CM. Also, this paper will present an overview of the changes in classification and nomenclature and give a review of the pathophysiological changes, diagnosis and treatment of CM, based on the most recent evidences.",

Il caso da noi riportato riguarda una donna di 21 anni che, dopo aver partorito con taglio cesareo per ipossia acuta fetale, in 7a giornata di puerperio riferisce che “c’e qualcosa che non va”: si dimostra particolarmente stanca, irritata, triste. Nei giorni successivi la sintomatologia si acuisce. Alla consulenza psichiatrica le viene diagnosticata “depressione post-partum moderata” e dopo una terapia per 6 mesi con paroxetina la prognosi e stata buona sia per la madre che per il neonato. I disturbi psichiatrici del post-partum rappresentano un importante problema di sanita pubblica, che puo anche avere conseguenze negative sullo sviluppo fisico e comportamentale, oltre che poter mettere a rischio la vita del neonato (“infanticidio”). Le varie legislazioni europee infliggono una pena minore nei casi di infanticidio, e in Italia la legge che lo regolamenta e l’art. 578 del c.p., riformulato dalla legge n. 42 del 5/8/1981: “La madre che cagiona la morte del proprio neonato immediatamente dopo il parto, o del feto durante il parto, quando il fatto e determinato da condizioni di abbandono materiale e morale connessa al parto, e punita con la reclusione da 4 a 12 anni”. Data quindi la potenziale gravita di questo disturbo, e importante diagnosticarlo in fase precoce ed attuare delle misure terapeutiche appropriate, oltre che supporto psicologico.",

      "title": "Emergencias en trastornos del movimiento hipercinéticos",
      "abstract": "Introduccion. Una emergencia en trastornos del movimiento es cualquier trastorno neurologico, de instauracion aguda o subaguda, en el cual la principal manifestacion clinica es un trastorno del movimiento primario, que persiste durante horas o dias, y en el que cualquier fallo en el diagnostico preciso o en el manejo del paciente puede dar lugar a una importante morbilidad o incluso mortalidad. Aunque son muy infrecuentes, es importante reconocer estos cuadros clinicos porque la gravedad de los sintomas y signos lleva a los pacientes a solicitar atencion medica urgente. Desarrollo. Diferenciamos dos escenarios diferentes: el debut abrupto de un trastorno del movimiento o la exacerbacion de un trastorno del movimiento ya existente. Es esencial realizar un diagnostico sindromico y etiologico precoces para poder llevar a cabo un manejo urgente adecuado. El espectro de causas posibles es muy amplio, pero es esencial recordar que la etiologia farmacologica es muy frecuente y comun a todas ellas. Conclusiones. La actitud general a seguir en un paciente que acude a urgencias por un trastorno del movimiento es indagar sobre el consumo de farmacos o drogas, preguntar sobre enfermedades neurologicas y psiquiatricas previas e intentar categorizar el trastorno del movimiento entre las diferentes entidades nosologicas. De cara al manejo en la urgencia, existen tres pilares fundamentales: tratamiento de soporte, tratamiento sintomatico y, si es posible, tratamiento especifico en funcion de la etiologia.",

CSC is one of the few eye diseases for which the relationship between the occurrence, course of the disease and patient psychosocial characteristics has been demonstrated including personality traits and the level of external stress factors.

Patients with central serous chorioretinopathy are characterized by certain personality traits i.e., type A personality, including a tendency to overachievement, competition, perfectionism, and a sthenic desire to maintain professional status.

      "title": "Cytokines as a Precipitant of Depressive Illness: Animal and Human Studies",
      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

      "abstract": "In order to improve diagnosis of schizophrenia with onset in adolescents at an early stage, we investigated in detail the clinical features of 74 patients with schizophrenia, (23 males) at adolescents psychiatric clinic. Many of the subjects had been suffering from the illness about 14 years old but had not undergone their first psychiatric examination until a few years later. A high percentage (more than 80%) of our subjects presented psychiatric symptoms such as delusional remembrance, delusional moods, delusions of persecution and hypobulia. Additionally, more than 60% of our subjects presented auditory hallucinations. In general, teenage patients with schizophrenia onset show vague symptoms such as anxiety, embarrassment and strange moods rather than obvious hallucinations. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify certain clinical features of this disorder in adolescents: many patients suffer delusional remembrance, delusional moods and delusions of persecution immediately after the onset of the illness. Gradually, problematic behaviors such as anorexia, self injury, offences against their families, voluntary vomiting, etc., develop, but patients do not always receive psychiatric examination at this stage. After socially obvious problems such as school refusal, withdrawal from social activities and lowering of school record develop over a period of time, patients may be urged to undergo psychiatric examination. Our research again underlines the difficulty of achieving diagnosis of schizophrenia at an early stage. The key to early diagnosis appears to be the accurate identification of psychiatric symptoms in the early stages of the illness at school, or at home if possible, before socially problematic behaviors arise.",

      "title": "A Case of Major Depressive Disorder and Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Responding to Escitalopram",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

The reporting of a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms by alcoholics with a history of experiencing hallucinations during withdrawal suggests that in some alcoholics, there exists a vulnerability for mood abnormalities which includes a predisposition toward other abnormal mental phenomena such as perceptual distortions.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief.

Resultados: Um total de 1590 artigos foi encontrado nas bases de dados pesquisadas, 218 foram avaliados em texto completo para elegibilidade e, por fim, cinco estudos preencheram todos os criterios de inclusao e foram incluidos na revisao sistematica. Dois dos estudos incluidos utilizaram a atomoxetina comparada ao placebo, sendo que em um deles a populacao era composta por pacientes adultos e no outro pediatrica. A desipramina foi tambem um dos medicamentos utilizados, a qual foi estudada para tratar criancas de 6 a 17 anos. Os outros dois trabalhos incluidos utilizaram o metilfenidato como tratamento farmacologico de pacientes pediatricos, porem, em um deles, a fluvoxamina foi combinada ao metilfenidato. Em relacao a qualidade metodologica, os estudos obtiveram pontuacoes de 3, 4 e 5 na escala de Jadad, sendo considerados de qualidade moderada a elevada, respectivamente. A analise do risco de vies verificou que 60% dos artigos receberam suporte da industria farmaceutica e, por isso, foram classificados com um alto risco de vies no dominio “Outros vieses”. Todos os estudos nos dominios “Cegamento dos participantes e profissionais” e “Cegamento dos avaliadores do desfecho” apresentaram baixo risco de vies. Em relacao ao dominio “Desfechos incompletos”,80% obtiveram baixo e 20% alto risco de vies. A “Geracao da sequencia aleatoria”, “Ocultacao da alocacao” e “Relato de desfecho seletivo” obtiveram as seguintes proporcoes de baixo vs incerto risco de vies: 60% vs 40%, 20% vs 80% e 60% vs 40%. Devido a alta heterogeneidade dos estudos elegiveis, nao foi possivel combinar os resultados para geracao de meta-analises. Isso ocorreu principalmente pela diversidade de medicamentos estudados e pela disparidade entre as medidas de desfecho empregadas. Conclusoes: Embora poucos estudos tenham sido encontrados, os resultados obtidos por meio desta revisao sistematica apontam para um beneficio mais expressivo da atomoxetina no tratamento do TDAH com TA, tanto por ter sido estudada em faixa etaria mais abrangente bem como por escalas mais especificas de avaliacao para ambos os transtornos terem sido utilizadas. Nao e possivel afirmar que a atomoxetina e superior as demais opcoes farmacologicas e apenas ensaios clinicos maiores poderao responder a esta questao.",

      "abstract": "Schizoaffective disorders are psychotic disorders in which the subjects exhibit symptoms of both Schizophrenia and Mood disorder.In the clinical practice it is often misdiagnosed due to the overlapping of the symptoms of these major psychiatric disorders.Life time prevalence of Schizoaffective disorder is 0.3% and the occurrence is more frequent in women than in men.It is a highly controversial topic in the psychiatric nosology and many substantial concerns were raised whether to deem it as a separate diagnosis or a subtype of these conditions.Still it is positioned as a separate entity owing to the common occurrence in the population.A 33-year-old lady presented with elevated mood, continuous irrelevant hyperverbal speech, increased self-esteem, increased anger, irritability and impulsivity.She also had occasional visual and auditory hallucinations and also delusions of grandiose type.She was exposed to continuous mental stress and the duration of the illness was recorded as 7 years.From the clinical interrogation it was evident that both the maniac and psychotic symptoms were prominent in the same episodes.The case was diagnosed as Schizoaffective disorder, Maniac type based on the diagnostic criteria mentioned in International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision.The case was diagnosed as Vatha Paittika Unmada as per the Ayurvedic clinical examination and was managed in the Inpatient department.A Sodhana based protocol was designed in a way intended to bring the vitiated doshas of Vatha, Pitta and Rajodosha into normalcy and to reduce the contributory factors of stress and anxiety.Significant improvements were noted in Young Mania Rating Scale and Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale recorded before and after the management protocol.",

      "title": "Is Favorable Outcome Possible After Prolonged Refractory Status Epilepticus?",
      "abstract": "Summary: When status epilepticus (SE) remains refractory to appropriate therapy, it is associated with high mortality and with substantial morbidity in survivors. Many outcome predictors such as age, seizure type, level of consciousness before treatment, and mostly, etiology, are well-established. A longer duration of SE is often associated with worse outcome, but duration may lose its prognostic value after several hours. Several terms and definitions have been used to describe prolonged, refractory SE, including “malignant SE,” “prolonged” SE, and more recently, “super refractory” SE, defined as “SE that has continued or recurred despite 24 hours of general anesthesia (or coma-inducing anticonvulsants).” There are few data available regarding the outcome of prolonged refractory SE, and even fewer for SE remaining refractory to anesthetic drugs. This article reviews reports of outcome after prolonged, refractory, and “super refractory” SE. Most information detailing the clinical outcome of patients surviving these severe illnesses, in which seizures can persist for days or weeks (and especially those concerning “super-refractory” SE) come from case reports and retrospective cohort studies. In many series, prolonged, refractory SE has a mortality of 30% to 50%, and several studies indicate that most survivors have a substantial decline in functional status. Nevertheless, several reports demonstrate that good functional outcome is possible even after several days of SE and coma induction. Treatment of refractory SE should not be withdrawn from younger patients without structural brain damage at presentation solely because of the duration of SE.",

      "title": "Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

      "title": "Status epilepticus: pathophysiology, epidemiology, and outcomes",
      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is the most common neurological medical emergency and continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our approach to the epilepsies in childhood has been clarified by the broad separation into benign and malignant syndromes. The factors that suggest a poorer outcome in terms of seizures, cognition, and behaviour include the presence of multiple seizure types, an additional, particularly cognitive disability, the presence of identifiable cerebral pathology, a high rate of seizures, an early age of onset, poor response to antiepileptic drugs, and the occurrence of CSE.1 \n\nConvulsive status epilepticus is not a syndrome in the same sense as febrile convulsions, benign rolandic epilepsy, and infantile polymorphic epilepsy. These latter disorders have a tight age frame, seizure semiology, and a reasonably predictable outcome. Episodes of CSE can occur in each: occasionally in febrile convulsions, rarely in benign rolandic epilepsy, and often in infantile polymorphic epilepsy. The issue of whether episodes of status epilepticus are intrinsically more dangerous in the malignant syndromes needs consideration before we accept global figures for CSE outcome, and we need to separate the immediate outcome of CSE from the eventual outcome, which may be heavily influenced by the context or syndrome in which it occurs.\n\nIn practical management we are likely to want to stop prolonged seizures as soon as possible, but in theoretical terms it may be important to know if some causes of CSE are intrinsically more dangerous. The paediatric dimension to CSE is therefore of many different causes and occurring in a patient who is less likely to have concomitant cardiovascular or respiratory disease. The hazards and outcome might be different. This paper reviews advances in the pathophysiology and consequences of CSE with special reference to age related phenomena.\n\nStatus epilepticus is a disorder in which the …",

      "abstract": "Amnesia for violent offenses is common, but little is known about underlying causes or whether memory can recover. In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

      "abstract": "Observation: We report the case of Mr. T, of Bosnian origin, in a situation of extreme social precarity, who presented with Sharp’s syndrome, discovered two years prior. He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

      "abstract": "The usual phenomena of cannabis intoxication include experiences which in a non-intoxicated state would be considered as psychiatric symptoms. These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

Depression, confusion, and thought disorders are frequently associated with the critical symptomatology, and they may suggest other psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia, mood disorder, conversion disorder) or a substance abuse. A diencephalic-hypothalamic dysfunction is suspected, even if this composite symptomatology cannot easily be linked to a simple mechanism. The aim of this article is to illustrate problems in differential diagnosis, using a case approach. History, course, and therapeutic intervention in a 21-year-old patient with KLS, associated with a clear psychiatric symptomatology and a critical affective pattern, is reported. Psychiatric correlates of KLS are discussed, including the relationship with affective disorders and the possible emotional impact of the attacks. Implications regarding a combined psychological and pharmacological treatment are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

The hallucinations accompanying acute schizophrenia more closely resembled those seen in affective disorder than in chronic schizophrenia, but no type of hallucination was diagnostic in the sense of occurring significantly more often in one illness than in another. Auditory hallucinations occurred almost as often in affective disorder as in schizophrenia; visual hallucinations were common in all five disorders; and derogatory voices, widely believed to signify depression, occurred most often in schizophrenia.",

Depressive Disorders, according to the DSM-5 Classification by the American Psychiatric Association, include, among others: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. The occurrence of Depressive Disorders causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning across various areas of life (personal, familial, social, and occupational). Therefore, depression in old age should not be analyzed without considering the individual and social aspects of an elderly person’s functioning. However, it is important to remember to consider its symptoms as a disease and not to misinterpret them as symptoms of the aging process. Bipolar and Related Disorders occur relatively rarely in old age; however, mild depression or depression with symptoms that do not form a complete syndrome is observed more frequently. Such diagnoses justify prioritizing psychotherapeutic interventions or potentially combining them with pharmacotherapy. CBT therapy is an effective way to support older people with depressive disorders in their recovery.",

Jede dieser Störungen hatte unterschiedliche psychosoziale Konsequenzen für den Patienten. Während z.B. die Frühdyskinesien den Patienten hochgradig ängstigen und ggf. psychotisch interpretiert werden, führt die Akathisie zu einer meist mehrere Tage dauernden motorischen Unruhe mit dem gleichzeitigen Gefühl der inneren Unruhe, das oft schwer von der psychotischen Agitiertheit abzugrenzen ist. Das mehrere Wochen dauernde Parkinsonoid bedeutet eine Veränderung des gesamten Erscheinungsbildes eines Menschen, in schweren Fällen eine Stigmatisierung im Sinne von masken- oder roboterartigem Aussehen.

      "abstract": "Sixteen cases of vascular headache of the migraine type are referred in whom marked neurological manifestations occurred in a unilateral distribution as part of a migraine attack (\"complicated migraine\"). The neurologic disorders observed, in order of frequency, include 10 cases of motor hemiparesis, 3 cases of unilateral cerebellar syndrome, 1 case of sensory-motor hemiparesis and 1 case showing signs of the involvement of the motor nuclei of the bulb. The recovery of the motor, sensory, cerebellar and brainstem defects was very slow (average duration: 44.25 days; mode: 14 days) in twelve cases. Two patients showed residual neurological signs respectively after 1 and 7 years from the migraine attack. The patients histories indicate classic or common migraine with a relatively high frequency (80% of the patients experienced one or more crises per month). The most of cases (75%) were female patients. The patients, at time of the attack of complicated migraine, had a mean age years of 32. In ten cases first-grade relatives suffered from classic or common migraine; in no case was there any report of associated or complicated migraine among the relatives. In 4 of the 16 cases the CT scan showed an area of hypodensity consistent to the region of the brain expected to be suffering in view of the clinical type of neurological defect. The Authors take into consideration the controversial relation between complicated migraine with slow or incomplete resolution of neurologic signs and focal brain ischemia due to atherothrombotic infarct, pointing out that the present state of knowledge prevents the reaching of final conclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The onset of the syndrome occurred either synchronously or at a later stage than the onset of the associated psychosis. The syndrome failed to remit in seven of the 20 cases, and in the others remission occurred either synchronously with or later than the remission of the basic psychosis. In all cases of depression, the syndrome cleared shortly after remission of the depressive illness. It was, however, more persistent than the accompanying psychosis in the schizophrenic patients with the Capgras variety. Relapse of the basic psychotic condition in the setting of which the syndrome had originally developed was invariably accompanied by reappearance of the syndrome.",

      "title": "Las suprarrenales en la hipoxia o anoxia",
      "abstract": "La disminución de tensión de oxígeno (hipoxia) es una situación de emergencia que somete el organismo a un esfuerzo (stress), el cual provoca múltiples modificaciones, algunas específicas o sea debidas a la disminución de oxígeno y otras generales, como ser el síndrome de adaptación. Si el animal sobrevive se observa una evolución de los fenómenos en tres fases: a) aguda o reacción de alarma; b) de adaptación o aclimatación; c ) de desadaptación o desaclimatación o descompensación. El sistema nervioso, estimulado inicialmente por la hipoxia, modifica la función de la corteza y la médula suprarrenal. La acción sobre la corteza se debe a que la acción nerviosa central provoca un aumento de la secreción de adrenocorticotrofina por la pars distalis de la hipófisis. La acción sobre la médula suprarrenal consiste en un estímulo sobre los centros simpáticos superiores (hipotálamo, etc.), que siguiendo la médula espinal y los nervios esplácnicos mayores y menores produce una fuerte descarga de adrenalina. Si la hipoxia es intensa o se provoca la asfixia, la descarga de adrenalina es una de las más intensas que pueden observarse y dura varios minutos. La reacción inicial sobre la corteza se produce al través de la hipófisis y por lo tanto falta en animales hipofisoprivos. La descarga de adrenocorticotrofina produce: a) disminución del ácido ascórbico, colesterol y lípidos de la corteza; b) el aumento de secreción de hormonas corticoadrenales produce disminución del timo y tejido linfático (acción linfolítica); c ) en la sangre, linfopenia y eosinofilopenia; d) aumento de los hidratos de carbono del organismo, en especial el glucógeno hepático, en animales en ayuno expuestos a la hipoxia; e) aumento de excreción de nitrógeno durante dicho ayuno; f) aumento de excreción de los 17-cetoesteroides urinarios. Durante la fase de adaptación o aclimatación vuelven a aumentar las grasas y el colesterol y sube el peso de la suprarrenal. Durante esta adaptación o aclimatación, la hipoxia es mejor soportada y produce menor disminución del ácido ascórbico suprarrenal. El peso corporal que había disminuido vuelve a recuperarse. Varios autores han comprobado que las hormonas activas sobre el metabolismo de los hidratos de carbono producen aumento de resistencia a la hipoxia. No se produjo con el extracto que empleamos y en las condiciones que experimentamos. La suprarrenal parece desempeñar un papel en la resistencia a la hipoxia. Si ésta es permanente o se repite todos los días, se ha encontrado que las ratas suprarrenoprivas no la soportan. No comprobamos esto en la anoxia aguda de 2 horas, ya sea por el corto tiempo de nuestros experimentos o por la raza de ratas empleadas. Es fácil comprender que se adicionen los síntomas de shock producidos por la hipoxia con los que produce la insuficiencia suprarrenal. Es posible producir un aumento de resistencia de las ratas normales o aún suprarrenoprivas, sometiéndolas paulatinamente una vez por día, durante períodos cortos (2 horas) a depresiones cada día mayores. En la hipoxia intensa permanente y prolongada o bien repetida diariamente durante períodos largos, se ha podido comprobar a la larga una pérdida de la adaptación. Se ha observado que reaparecen: la depleción de lípidos en la corteza, la disminución de resistencia a la hipoxia, la hipoglucemia, una tendencia a la temperatura subnormal. etc. En resumen: la hipoxia produce un aumento de actividad del sistema hipofiso-corticosuprarrenal y también, si es intensa, provoca una descarga de adrenalina de la médula suprarrenal por intermedio del mecanismo simpático-méduloadrenal. La presencia de la función suprarrenal favorece la resistencia del organismo durante la hipoxia, como sucede en todos los casos de emergencia. El aumento de las funciones cortical y medular puede cooperar con los demás mecanismos de resistencia del organismo, en una proporción que es difícil de precisar cuantitativamente.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "There are two kinds of flashbacks: the self-programed or intra-individual variety and pre-programed or inter-individual flashbacks re-presenting mythical and narrative event structures which contribute to the survival of the species. Both types of experiences are arousal-state bound and stage (set and setting) or culture bound. Flashbackers may be characterized by (1) their variability (large SD) on perceptual-behavioural tasks pointing to their extensive cognitive or interpretive repertoire, (2) they are minimizers (or reducers) of sensory input (particularly at the peak of a hallucinogenic drug experience), (3) as a group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and experience), (3) as group they display high resting heart rates, (4) are hypnotizable and hence (5) prefer righ cerebral hemispheric cognition, (6) displaying EEG-alpha dominance in the resting, waking state. Flashback and hypnotic recall differ only in the ways and means by which they are induced. Hypnotic induction, however, is not to be confused with the induced state that may be any ordinary or non-ordinary state of consciousness on the perception-hallucination-meditation continuum which the subject has a least once experienced before. If mind is an open system comprising the individual's mind and the minds of his total environment, i.e. his past and present sets and settings, then for many of us thoughts and actions are hypnotically induced, and memories are flashbacks of those experiences.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

Each of its features (affective instability, impulsivity, unstable relationships, and cognitive defects) reflects different diatheses. BPD differs from other Axis II disorders in its high level of symptoms, but is not a variant of an Axis I disorder and is difficult to describe through dimensional traits. This review suggests that BPD needs to be diagnosed with a narrower set of criteria that cover all of its domains. In the long run, the disorder will need to be redefined on the basis of its etiology and pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious disorder that often affects young people in their early twenties. The outcome is often poor, associated costs and burdens are extensive. Almost 15% of schizophrenics end up with frequent admission and require long-term residential care (1). Recently, the idea of early detection and intervention has been launched as a new and promising approach. The starting point for consideration regarding early intervention strategies is the observation that most patients who develop schizophrenia have had a period with non-specific, non-psychotic prodormal symptoms before the onset of psychosis (2,3). The prodormal period has been reported to last, on average, 1 – 2 years. Another finding across studies in that the period from onset of a manifest psychosis to onset of adequate treatment (duration of untreated psychosis DUP) is long. The mean duration of DUP is 1-2 years with a median of approximately 26 weeks. The majority of studies show a statistically significant correlation between long DUP and poor outcome (4,5), although others have not found the correlation (6,7).",

Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

      "title": "A Case of Forgotten Poisoning in a Patient Presenting with Speech Disorder",
      "abstract": "Anticholinergic poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the emergency department. Beautiful hawthorn (atropa belladonna), which is found in our country, is one of the plants that can cause anticholinergic syndrome. It is important in the differential diagnosis in cases progressing with general status disorder and loss of consciousness and psychotic findings. The onset of anticholinergic intoxication varies depending on the toxin and occurs within one to two hours following oral ingestion. The diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning is based on clinical findings. Anticholinergic poisoning is easily diagnosed when a history of exposure to an anticholinergic substance is obtained and the patient shows altered mental status, delirium or hallucinations. However, in cases with no history and unknown exposure, the diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication is considered when clinical signs and symptoms caused by mental status disorder and anticholinergic effects are detected on physical examination. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of slurred speech, altered consciousness and facial shifting that started about 2 hours ago. On physical examination, the patient was incoopere and disoriented, GCS:12 eyes were spontaneously open, obeying orders but making unintelligible sounds, nuchal rigidity was suspiciously positive, bilateral babinski reflex was positive. On admission vital signs were blood pressure 144/72 mmHg, pulse 98/min, temperature 37 °C, SO2 94%, fingerstick blood glucose 104 mg/dl and ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. There were no acute pathologic findings on both brain CT and brain MR imaging. In the control physical examination, both pupils were mydriatic, IR -/- and the patient had dry mouth. According to the anamnesis obtained from another relative of the patient, it was learned that they ate spinach in the evening and speech disorder started afterwards. The patient was diagnosed with anticholinergic intoxication considering that the spinach eaten by the patient with clinical findings might have been mixed with the beautiful hawthorn weed. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the importance of detailing the anamnesis and the necessity of a complete systemic examination in patients presenting with confusion and speech disorder.",

Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie.

However, prolonged delirium can occur in people with brain damage. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that occurs when the entire brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. HIE results in neurological injury and long term dysfunction. Outcome of HIE ranges from significant changes in personality, impairment in memory, cognition and attention, to coma and vegetative states. Only a quarter of patients survive to be discharged from hospital. There are very few case reports of prolonged delirium secondary to HIE following hanging.\r\nCase description: A 27 year old Asian man with alcohol dependence syndrome developed prolonged delirium (more than two months) following HIE subsequent to hanging.\r\nDiscussion: Prolonged delirium has been reported in 1/3rd cases of delirium. Risk factors for prolonged delirium are increasing age, severe delirium, increasing number of medical conditions. Prolonged delirium was found to be associated with poor functional outcome and increased mortality.\r\nConclusion: Our case report highlights the importance of early detection and management of prolonged delirium.",

Ces crises sont en rapport avec des processus psychogènes complexes et non avec une décharge neuronale excessive. Les CPNE sont une pathologie fréquente, coûteuse et grave dont l’incidence équivaut à celle de la sclérose en plaques. Pourtant, cette pathologie reste peu et mal connue des psychiatres. Beaucoup d’entre nous pensent que ces crises ont disparu après Charcot. En effet, actuellement, ces patients sont adressés aux neurologues. Un quart des patients vus par un épileptologue souffrent de CPNE. L’étiopathogénie est multifactorielle, comprenant des facteurs pédisposants, des facteurs déclenchants et des facteurs de maintien. Deux mécanismes principaux apparaissent : une prédisposition neurobiologique et des facteurs traumatiques inducteurs de processus dissociatif. Les modèles récents placent la dysrégulation émotionnelle au centre de la problématique. L’imagerie fonctionnelle a mis en évidence des anomalies fonctionnelles entre les aires cérébrales impliquées dans les émotions et les aires motrices. Il existe aussi des perturbations des 3 composantes émotionnelles : sur le plan cognitif avec une alexithymie chez 85 % des patients et des biais attentionnels pour les stimuli négatifs ; sur le plan comportemental avec une réponse d’évitement et sur le plan physiologique avec des taux de cortisol basal augmentés et une diminution de l’arythmie sinusale. Nous exposerons les résultats de notre étude comparative prospective inédite qui compare la réponse électrodermale à des stimuli visuels entre un groupe de patientes CPNE et de témoins sains appariés. Nous avons mis en évidence des perturbations de la réponse neuro-végétative avec une hyporéceptivité aux stimuli plaisants et une corrélation négative entre la propension à la dissociation et l’amplitude de la réponse électrodermale. Ces résultats ouvrent des perspectives en termes de compréhension des mécanismes mais aussi en termes diagnostique et thérapeutique pour développer des outils psychothérapiques de rééducation émotionnelle chez les patients souffrant de CPNE.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Thorough and interdisciplinary diagnostics including extensive allergological testing procedures (provocative tests) revealed both somatic diagnoses (contact allergy, pseudo-allergic reactions, sicca syndrome, liver steatosis, porokeratosis superficialis disseminata actinica) as well as psychiatric diagnoses (predisposition to depression).

      "title": "Status Epilepticus in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) can take various forms in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), some of which forms also occur in symptomatic or focal epilepsies. Although the clinical semiology of the SE episodes may be similar in these different epilepsies, the frequency, response to treatment and prognosis differ. (a) Convulsive SE is surprisingly uncommon in IGE and much less common than in the secondarily generalized or partial epilepsies. Also, when it does occur, it usually responds rapidly to treatment. (b) Typical absence SE occurs only in patients with IGE (the subcategories with typical absence seizures) and also in the syndrome of de novo absence SE of late onset. This form of nonconvulsive SE should be differentiated from atypical absence SE, which occurs in the secondarily generalized epilepsy encephalopathies, and from complex partial SE which occurs in focal epilepsy. The clinical symptoms of these three types overlap but the prognosis and response to treatment are different. The mechanisms underlying absence SE are uncertain and may include both genetic and environmental factors. The termination of absence seizures has been hypothesized to be due to persistent activation of a depolarizing current in thalamocortical neurons that inactivates T-type calcium channels. SE could thus result from dysfunction of this channel or mechanisms that hyperpolarize thalamocortical neurons-these include decreased cortical inhibition, increased reticular thalamic neuronal activity or increased thalamocortical neuron GABA(B)-receptor activation. (c) Generalized electrographic SE is encountered in IGE in the syndrome of phantom absence with GTCS. It also occurs in ESES and in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome. The seizure phenomenology overlaps with the focal SE of temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. (d) Myoclonic SE is also uncommon in IGE but occurs in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. It is more commonly encountered in progressive myoclonic epilepsies, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and in the Dravet syndrome. (e) Autonomic status occurs largely in the Panayiotopoulos syndrome. It is included here under the rubric of IGE, although the epilepsy has focal as well as generalized features and its nosological position is controversial. Fifty percent of seizures in this syndrome could be classified as status epilepticus. There is no doubt that convulsive SE can result in cerebral damage. In animal models of focal SE, nonconvulsive forms can also result in cerebral damage, but cerebral damage is not observed in animal models of absence SE. Similarly, cerebral damage seems not to occur in the forms of nonconvulsive SE in human IGE.",

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

Néanmoins, peu d’études visant à comprendre la nature et le rôle du ralentissement psychomoteur ont été réalisées dans cette maladie. Si le ralentissement psychomoteur fait partie des critères diagnostiques du trouble dépressif caractérisé, il n’est pas actuellement considéré comme un élément central au diagnostic de schizophrénie. La catatonie est longtemps restée comme un sous-type de schizophrénie mais l’évolution du DSM dans sa 5 e version la considère comme une spécification pouvant être associée à d’autres troubles mentaux (trouble dépressif caractérisé, trouble bipolaire, trouble psychotique bref…). Pourtant le ralentissement psychomoteur est observé dès le début de la maladie et a un impact sur les capacités cognitives et le fonctionnement des patients schizophrènes. Le ralentissement de la performance sur les différentes mesures psychomotrices est associé, indépendamment du traitement, à la présence de symptômes négatifs et, dans une moindre mesure, à la présence de symptômes positifs et dépressifs [1]. Les études comparant les patients souffrant d’un trouble dépressif caractérisé avec des patients schizophrènes ont retrouvé un ralentissement global chez les patients déprimés alors qu’il était plus marqué au niveau cognitif pour les patients schizophrènes [2]. D’autres paramètres extrinsèques peuvent cependant influencer les symptômes psychomoteurs comme l’âge des patients ou les traitements antipsychotiques de première génération. La spécificité et l’impact pronostique du ralentissement psychomoteur chez les patients souffrant de schizophrénie nécessitent pour certains auteurs [3] de considérer les perturbations psychomotrices comme un critère diagnostique de schizophrénie.",

There is, in a considerable proportion of the cases coming under my observation, retrospective evidence that there was conscious fear at the time of the occurrence.\" Delayed inhibition\" in the Pavlovian sense does not seem to have been the process responsible in them for the subsequent psycho- neurosis.3. It is possible that some stupors are essentially states of extreme preoccupation with the frightening experiences (cf.Hoch's (1921) Benign Stupors and the preoccupation with death).4. Other stupors are presumably hysterical (avoidance) methods of dealing with the same kind of experience.5. The long persistence of conditioned responses after traurna, up to two years ln some R.A.F.cases, and probably indefinitely longer, has its parallel (Anderson and Parmenter, 1941) in sheep with experimental neuroses.6.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a serious psychiatric disorder of unknown etiology, with an acute or subacute onset, and is a leading cause of disability in young adults. The disease is often manifested as perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Positive symptoms refer to abnormal or hyperactive mental functions, including abnormal sensations (visual and auditory hallucinations), delusions, confused thoughts, disorganized speech and behavior, etc. Negative symptoms refer to reduced or absent mental functions, including lack of motivation, lack of pleasure, social withdrawal, reduced willpower, etc. Cognitive deficits include impaired attention, decline in executive function and working memory, etc. Although the use of chlorpromazine in 1950 cured or alleviated the psychiatric symptoms of most SCZ patients, there were still 20% of the patients who were drug-resistant or dissatisfied with psychotropic treatments. So far, SCZ treatment mainly includes medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychotherapy, and rTMS treatment.",

      "title": "Comparison of auditory hallucinations across different disorders and syndromes",
      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

Aux obstacles à la détection présents tant chez le patient que chez les soignants, s’ajoute une certaine difficulté pour le diagnostic. Cette difficulté est liée à la possible confusion entre des symptômes de dépression et les symptômes de la maladie somatique. Pour la surmonter le clinicien doit prêter une attention particulière aux symptômes émotionnels. Le diagnostic différentiel portera principalement sur des réactions psychologiques transitoires et les états de delirium. Le dépistage et le diagnostic sont importants parce qu’il existe des traitements efficaces. L’abord psychologique est toujours fondamental. Il pourra suffire dans des dépressions modérées si le patient peut recevoir une psychothérapie structurée par un thérapeute bien formé. Dans l’abord psychologique doivent être prises en compte des questions spécifiques en rapport avec la culture, les liens familiaux ou la spiritualité du patient. Le traitement pharmacologique sera souvent indispensable. Il s’appuiera essentiellement sur les antidépresseurs en privilégiant les inhibiteurs sélectifs pour leur bonne tolérance et, en cas de douleurs, plus spécifiquement, les doubles inhibiteurs de la recapture de la sérotonine et de la noradrénaline. Les psychostimulants sont souvent insuffisamment utilisés. Au final, il n’y a pas de raison de ne pas faire bénéficier du traitement de leur dépression ces patients avec maladie fatale.",

      "abstract": "With a lifetime prevalence of 30%, alcohol use disorders (AUDs)--which in DSM-IV-TR include alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence--are among the most common psychiatric disorders. (1) Depressive disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia, frequently co-occur with AUDs. (2-4) This pattern of comorbidity adversely affects the prognosis, course, and treatment of both MDD and AUDs. (5) High severity in 1 of these disorders is associated with high severity in the other. (2), (6) Alcohol dependence appears to prolong the course of depressio. (7), (8) and increases the risk of suicidal symptoms and behaviors. (9), (10) Patients with depression and AUDs are at increased risk of relapse to heavy drinking. (7), (11) Whether the high comorbidity rate of depressive disorders and AUDs is a result of 1 disorder causing the other (ie, AUDs leading to depression or vice versa) or can be attributed to shared etiology is unknown. Clinicians need to consider this question when treating patients with this pattern of comorbidity because distinguishing primary depression from secondary depression influences treatment decisions. (12) There is a great need for pharmacologic interventions that can concurrently treat both depression and AUDs. This article reviews the evidence for current treatments for dually diagnosed patients and highlights novel agents that are worthy of further study for this complex patient population. Current treatment options Pharmacotherapy for MDD and alcohol dependence is common when these conditions occur alone. FDA-approved medications for treating depression include monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. SSRIs are the most widely used class of antidepressants. They gained FDA approval based on studies conducted in noncomorbid patients because patients with comorbid conditions usually are excluded from research studies. (13) Few trials have evaluated patients with depression and AUDs; TCAs and SSRIs are best studied in these patients.

During the acute phase, patients demonstrate active symptoms of schizophrenia. The goal of treatment during this phase is to reduce the most severe symptoms of the illness, particularly positive symptoms. Nearly all acute episodes should be treated with an antipsychotic medication. Moreover, drug treatment should occur as early in this phase as possible. Certain treatment principles should guide management: an antipsychotic drug and dose should be used that appropriately balances side effects and efficacy. Trial of the selected drug(s) should last at least 4-6 weeks before the medication is changed. Newer antipsychotics have clear advantages over older drugs in terms of side effects and efficacy. Greater use of these agents may improve the outcome in acute schizophrenia.",

Es necesario llamar la atencion sobre este hecho, ya que muchas veces se cre que la dependencia supone en todas los casos una dependencia fisica unida a la necesidad de aumentar la dosis de la droga. Por el contrario, a veces se descarta erroneamente la existencia de dependencia cuando no se observa un incremento en la dosificacion. \nSe ha descrito ademas una serie de trastornos que aumentan la necesidad de administrarse el medicamento o la droga independientemente del tiempo de evolucion de la dependencia.

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "title": "Bilateral Anterior Capsulotomy for the Treatment of Refractory Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a form of mental illness that causes one or more distressing somatic symptoms leading to a significant disruption to everyday life, characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. While SSD is characterized by significant discomfort in some parts of the body, these symptoms are not related to any known medical condition and therefore it cannot be diagnosed using any medical instrument examination. Currently available treatments for SSD, including drug therapy and psychotherapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy), usually improve psychiatric symptoms, but the results are often disappointing. Furthermore, SSD is often comorbid with anxiety and depression (75.1 and 65.7%, respectively). Importantly, interventions targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC; e.g., deep brain stimulation and thermal ablation) can effectively treat various mental disorders, such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and eating disorders, suggesting that it may also be effective for treating the depressive symptoms associated with SSD comorbidity. In this report, a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with SSD accompanied with depression and anxiety underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy. The patient complained of nausea and vomiting, swelling of the hilum of the liver for 14 years, weakness of the limbs for 13 years, and burning pain in the esophagus for 1 year. Psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments were conducted to record the severity of the patients' symptoms and the progression of postoperative symptoms. The patient's somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms as well as quality of life improved significantly and steadily; thus, anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication were stopped. However, the patient developed new somatization symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and sternal pain, 10 months after the operation. Therefore, the patient resumed taking flupentixol and melitracen in order to control the new symptoms. This study shows that bilateral anterior capsulotomy appears to be a complementary treatment for refractory SSD with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, postoperative use of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications may be useful for controlling future somatization symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

About 14% of epilepsy patients are under 15 years old and 24% are over 64, with 62% being between those ages. There is an increased risk of death due to accidents, suicide and other medical conditions. There are also cases where the death appears to be directly related to epilepsy itself, usually referred to as Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). This information is not always passed from doctor to patient, for various reasons. Epilepsy share is an uncontrolled electrical discharge from nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. This is the part of the brain that integrates higher mental functions, general movement, and the functions of the internal organs in the abdominal cavity, perception, and behavioral reactions. The early warning system will be based on three factors: 1. Detection of abnormal electrical activity of brain. 2. Detection of abnormal breathing (too fast or too slow) that almost always accompanies the onset of an attack. 3. Unusual sensations or movements of parts of body such as muscles relaxation and tightening.",

Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized.

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome.

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

There are also\r\nseveral other conditions in childhood that can manifest with periodically occurring paroxysmal\r\nevents2-4. It is important to distinguish these non-epileptic paroxysmal events from epileptic\r\nseizures. This can be challenging as they may partially share the same clinical manifestations.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect. Keywords: chronic dizziness; chronic instability; ototoxicity; vestibulotoxicity; dynamic posturography.

In addition to other somatic symptoms, withdrawal-emergent dyskinesias may be observed. \"Covert dyskinesia\" refers to a masked form of tardive dyskinesia that becomes clinically detectable only after antipsychotic drugs are withdrawn or their dosage is reduced. Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes. The principal value of the concept of covert dyskinesia is in the secondary and tertiary prevention of tardive dyskinesia through early discovery and treatment.",

If the child endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child’s symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the duration required by DSM. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "title": "How to Stabilize an Acutely Psychotic Patient: In Psychiatric Emergencies, Use a Stepwise Approach to Provide Safe, Effective Treatment",
      "abstract": "Acute psychosis is a symptom that can be caused by many psychiatric and medical conditions. Psychotic patients might be unable to provide a history or participate in treatment if they are agitated, hostile, or violent. An appropriate workup may reveal the etiology of the psychosis; secondary causes, such as medical illness and substance use, are prevalent in the emergency room (ER) setting. If the patient has an underlying primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia or mania, illness-specific intervention will help acutely and long-term. With agitated and uncooperative psychotic patients, clinicians often have to intervene quickly to ensure the safety of the patient and those nearby. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This article focuses on the initial evaluation and treatment of psychotic patients in the ER, either by a psychiatric emergency service or a psychiatric consultant. This process can be broken down into: * triage or initial clinical assessment * initial psychiatric stabilization, including pharmacologic interventions and agitation management * diagnostic workup to evaluate medical and psychiatric conditions * further psychiatric evaluation * determining safe disposition. (1) Triage determines the next step Initial clinical assessment and triage are necessary to select the appropriate immediate intervention. When a patient arrives in the ER, determine if he or she requires urgent medical attention. Basic initial screening should include: * vital signs * finger stick blood glucose * medical history * signs or symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal * signs of trauma (eg, neck ligature marks, gunshot wounds, lacerations) * asking the patient to give a brief history leading up to the current presentation. A review of medical records may reveal patients' medical and psychiatric history and allergies. Collateral documentation--such as ambulance run sheets or police reports--may provide additional information. If no immediate medical intervention is warranted, determine if the patient can wait in an open, unlocked waiting area or if he or she needs to be in an unlocked area with a sitter, a locked open area, or a secluded room with access to restraints. In general, psychotic patients who pose a threat of harm to themselves or others or cannot care for themselves because of their psychosis need locked areas or observation. Initial psychiatric stabilization Agitation is diagnostically unspecific but can occur in patients with psychosis. Psychotic patients can become unpredictably and impulsively aggressive and assaultive. Rapid intervention is necessary to minimize risk of bodily harm to the patient and those around the patient. Physicians often must make quick interventions based on limited clinical information. It is important to recognize early signs and symptoms of agitation, including: * restlessness (pacing, fidgeting, hand wringing, fist clenching, posturing) * irritability * decreased attention * inappropriate or hostile behaviors. (2) Pharmacologic interventions. The initial goals of pharmacologic treatment are to calm the patient without oversedation, thereby allowing the patient to take part in his or her care and begin treatment for the primary psychotic illness.3*4 Offering oral medications first and a choice of medications may help a patient feel more in control of the situation. If a patient has to be physically restrained, pharmacotherapy may limit the amount of time spent in restraints. Medication choice depends on several factors, including onset of action, available formulation (eg, IM, liquid, rapidly dissolving), the patient's previous medication response, side effect profile, allergies or adverse reactions to medications, and medical comorbidities. (3) If a patient has a known psychotic illness, it may be helpful to administer the patient's regular antipsychotic or anxiolytic medication. …",

      "title": "Evaluación de la regulación emocional cognitiva en fibromialgia mediante el instrumento cognitive emotion regulation (cerq)",
      "abstract": "Las emociones son parte de la vida cotidiana. Con el objetivo de alcanzar aquello nos proponemos (incluido mantener el bienestar), las personas utilizamos diferentes estrategias de regulacion emocional. La regulacion emocional es el proceso por el que tratamos de modificar la expresion de una emocion ante una determinada situacion. Existe un creciente interes en la investigacion de la regulacion de la emocion debido a sus implicaciones para la salud fisica y mental. Las personas con fibromialgia sufren dolor cronico generalizado que suele ir acompanado de una gran variedad de sintomas, entre los que destacan la fatiga persistente, rigidez muscular, sueno no reparador y dificultades cognitivas (fibrofog) en la atencion, la memoria o la concentracion. Sintomas de alta intensidad afectiva y de ansiedad son muy frecuentes en la fibromialgia, y los deficits en la regulacion de la emocion en pacientes con este sindrome son bien conocidos. Con una prevalencia mundial de 2 a 4% y en ausencia de un tratamiento curativo, esta constelacion de sintomas mencionada afecta gravemente la vida diaria de los pacientes. El impacto en el area personal, economica y social es dramatico. El Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) mide la regulacion de la emocion con base cognitiva (aquello que pensamos cuando surge una emocion ante una situacion en la vida). El CERQ captura nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion: Autoculparse, Aceptacion, Rumiacion, Centrarse en lo positivo, Focalizacion en planes, Reevaluacion positiva, Poner en perspectiva, Catastrofizacion y Culpar a otros. Estas estrategias de pueden ayudar a las personas a regular sus emociones, de una manera Adaptativa o Menos adaptativa, facilitando u obstaculizando el manejo de la situacion. En este sentido, el uso de estrategias regulatorias Menos adaptativas se concibe como un factor transdiagnostico de vulnerabilidad psicopatologica. En esta tesis doctoral, examinamos las propiedades psicometricas de la version en espanol del CERQ, cuyo formato fue adaptado (items agrupados por dimension) considerando los sintomas de la fibromialgia. Con este fin, recopilamos datos clinicos y de CERQ de 231 pacientes con fibromialgia que participaron en un ensayo aleatorizado y controlado realizado en el Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Espana). Los analisis de datos apoyaron las propiedades psicometricas del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia y confirmaron la estructura de nueve factores, una consistencia interna adecuada y una superposicion minima entre las subescalas, coincidiendo con estudios previos realizados con muestras clinicas y no clinicas. Ademas, los analisis de correlacion y regresion apoyaron la validez de construccion del instrumento CERQ. En resumen, en este trabajo llegamos a la conclusion de que la version adaptada del CERQ es un instrumento solido y util para evaluar la regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en la fibromialgia. Como resultado principal de esta tesis doctoral, tenemos una medida validada empiricamente para evaluar la frecuencia de uso de nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en pacientes con fibromialgia, que generalmente se caracterizan por dificultades de regulacion de la emocion. Los estudios futuros que utilicen un diseno longitudinal podran abordar algunos aspectos psicometricos pendientes del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia, como la estabilidad en el tiempo (fiabilidad test-retest) y la sensibilidad al cambio.",

This will help determine whether the medical condition is the main cause of the psychosis, or an exacerbating factor. Acute psychotic symptoms can be managed with antipsychotics or benzodiazepines depending on the degree of distress and disruption to the patient, but the mainstay of treatment involves treating the underlying medical condition. Patients may also require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization for acute stabilization and to minimize the risk of harm to self or others.",

      "title": "Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Pathogenetic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications",
      "abstract": "The co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that presents significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by the following: (1) Social communication difficulties: challenges in understanding and responding to social cues, initiating and maintaining conversations, and developing and maintaining relationships. (2) Repetitive behaviors: engaging in repetitive actions, such as hand-flapping, rocking, or lining up objects. (3) Restricted interests: focusing intensely on specific topics or activities, often to the exclusion of other interests. (4) Sensory sensitivities: over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, such as sounds, touch, tastes, smells, or sights. These challenges can significantly impact individuals' daily lives and require specialized support and interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked (≥2) seizures that occur >24 h apart. Single seizures are not considered epileptic seizures. Epilepsy is often idiopathic, but various brain disorders, such as malformations, strokes, and tumors, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. While these two conditions were once considered distinct, growing evidence suggests a substantial overlap in their underlying neurobiology. The prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with ASD is significantly higher than in the general population. This review will explore the epidemiology of this comorbidity, delve into the potential mechanisms linking ASD and epilepsy, and discuss the implications for diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

In this latter group, patients have episodes of anxiety, psychosis, or impaired impulse control.

Two types of asthenia (extensive and limited) have been identified as a result. With regard to clinical peculiarities these manifestations can be collated respectively with \"pseudoneurasthenia\" and \"autochtonous asthenia\". The author has analyzed the dynamics of these variants of the asthenic symptom complex to which, with the progression of the process, disturbances of the non-delirious hypochondria type are added. The author has established the relationship between clinical features of asthenia and the degree of progression of the process and a differing structure of negative changes formed at late stages of the disease. The first type (extensive asthenia) is observed in the framework of slowly progressive neurosis-like schizophrenia with manifestations of a moderate asthenic defect. The second type (limited asthenia) is noted in psychopathy-like slowly progressive schizophrenia associated with signs of greater progression and psychopathy-like changes of the \"verschoben-type\" with intellectual reduction.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

Además, una mayoría de las personas que intentan suicidarse tiene más de un diagnóstico. Esto es especialmente cierto si se tienen en cuenta los trastornos subumbral del Eje II o el Eje I. La existencia de un trastorno explica en gran parte la asociación entre la mayoría de las variables socioeconómicas (sexo, matrimonio, nivel educativo) y la suicidalidad. Los trastornos depresivos son el factor de riesgo principal, riesgo asociado probablemente a un episodio actual justo antes del intento. La asociación con episodios depresivos de un trastorno de ansiedad o la existencia de rasgos impulsivos (trastorno de la personalidad del grupo B, abuso de drogas o ambos) aumenta el riesgo de actuación. La ideación suicida y los intentos de suicidio muestran curvas de comienzo paralelas con picos entre los 14-20 años de edad, con la existencia de un diagnóstico previo del DSM-III-R como un predictor poderoso. El número de trastornos asociados aumenta linealmente la probabilidad de intentar el suicidio y es el único predictor significativo de la mortalidad. Un tratamiento adecuado de los trastornos mentales podría reducir sustancialmente la suicidalidad.",

Intellectual and mnemic disturbances are regarded as nonspecific psychoorganic ones, and they are directly associated with the volume of alcohol consumed and the severity of intoxication. Similar relations were revealed between alcohol addiction and the alcohol abstinence syndrome: alcohol addiction is combined with nosologically neutral post-intoxication disturbances and imparts the nosological specificity to the entire symptom-complex.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are schizophrenia-like disorders which are not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but which are sharing symptoms, causes and risk factors with schizophrenia. The concept emerges from the recognition that the clinical syndrome of schizophrenia is too restrictive to tap the whole variation of symptoms and features induced by causes underlying schizophrenia. The specific criterion for schizophrenia spectrum disorders is that they are aetiologically related to schizophrenia; and particularly that they are driven by the same familial–genetic factors. Along this line, two types of syndromes were proposed as components of the schizophrenic spectrum: (a) personality features and disorders – sometimes the spectrum concept is restricted to personality traits, and (b) psychotic symptoms and disorders, often with an episodic course, which are sharing clinical features with chronic schizophrenia without meeting the full diagnosis.",

The mentioned symptoms should be present for a minimum period of two weeks for the diagnosis of major depression to be established. Left untreated, major depressive disorder may interfere with daily life activities and eventually leads to suicide, which is one of the leading cause of death in the United States. In this report, the referred case study for major depressive disorder will be the scenario of a 30 year old woman who attempted suicide by consuming 8 bodrex pills.

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

State behavior refers to behaviors that come and go, such as a mood state and many DSM axis I conditions.

The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria.

Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

While DSM-IV defines mixed states as manic episodes combined with full syndromal major depressive illness, mixed states can be predominately depressive or manic. Predominately manic or depressive mixed states share similar characteristics with respect to course of illness, and clinical presentation, and these characteristics emerge at subsyndromal levels of mixed symptoms. Therefore, there appears to be a continuum of mixed states across depression, and mania. Mixed episodes combine depression and activation, leading to susceptibility to suicidal behavior and other severe behavioral disturbances. Patients with mixed states have a severe course of illness, including early onset, frequent episodes, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and suicidal behavior. Mixed states can be difficult to treat and are likely to require more pharmacological agents than non-mixed states. Successful treatment, based on agents with mood-stabilizing properties, requires a vigorous approach to the severe underlying illness.",

Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona. En el presente caso clínico resaltamos la importancia de la cianocobalamina en la evaluación de los pacientes con síntomas catatónicos.",

      "title": "First seizure definitions and worldwide incidence and mortality",
      "abstract": "Summary While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Seizures may be acute symptomatic or unprovoked. Acute symptomatic seizures are seizures occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Unprovoked seizures are seizures occurring in the absence of precipitating factors and may be caused by a static injury (remote symptomatic seizures) or a progressing injury (progressive symptomatic seizures). Unprovoked seizures may be single or recurrent (epilepsy). The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is 29–39 per 100,000 per year. These predominate in men, in the youngest age class, and in the elderly. Traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, infarction, and metabolic insults are the commonest causes. The incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23–61 per 100,000 person‐years. As with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures predominate in men and in patients less than 12 months and older than 65 years. Studies on the mortality of acute symptomatic seizures are lacking. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.3 has been reported in patients experiencing a single unprovoked seizure. The SMR in patients with a newly diagnosed unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 according to the study population and design. The SMR is highest in the youngest patients and in those with symptomatic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "Is there really a Schizophrenia? The Long-term Course of Psychotic Phenomena∗",
      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face (although sometimes pallor is more marked than cyanosis); then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

Bei letzterer dominieren schwere depressive Episoden mit einer oder mehreren Hypomanien. Aber auch weitere, mildere Verlaufsformen wie beispielsweise die Zyklothymia können durchaus behandlungsrelevant sein. Die Lebenszeitprävalenz der Bipolar-I-Störung schätzt man heute um die 1% und für das traditionelle Spektrum bipolarer Störungen, Bipolar I und II, etwa um 2% (). Von klinischer Relevanz sind jedoch auch Verläufe, die diese Kriterien nicht restlos erfüllen, z.B. durch eine Dauer der Hypomanien von weniger als vier Tagen oder die Entwicklung von Hypomanien nur in unmittelbarem Zusammenhang mit Antidepressiva-Gabe (einen sogenannten medikamentinduzierten Switch). Auch diese Patienten sollten nicht wie rezidivierende Depressionen, sondern wie bipolare Patienten behandelt werden ().",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting.

The signs of hypoactive delirium are lethargy, confusion, apathy, hypersomnia, muttering, difficulty in maintaining attention, and difficulty in understanding and performing commands. Valproate is commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorders. It is also used for the management of alcohol withdrawal delirium and agitative-aggressive deliriums. However, few reports are available about the valproate-induced delirium. In this report, we present a 46 years-old woman with bipolar disorder for 14 years. During her last two hospital admissions, she had been diagnosed with manic episode with psychotic features and she had received valproate. She experienced three hypoactive delirium episodes lasting 2-3 days throughout the treatment period of first week. The patient predominantly had the following signs; vomiting, hypersalivation, confusion, drowsiness, dysphasia, and hypoactivity. At the first day of delirium episode, serum valproate level was found to be within the therapeutic range (98.4, 117.1, and 65.6 mug/ml; respectively). In addition, she had normal results of cranial MRI, complete blood count, urine analysis, electrocardiogram, ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine and electrolytes. The serum ammonia level of the patient could not been measured due to limitations of laboratory facilities. The patient's consciousness improved dramatically 2-3 days after cessation of valproate. In conclusion, valproate can induce delirium at therapeutic blood levels in some patients via various mechanisms and this side effect has to be considered during valproate use.",

Integrative model of depression assumes a negative feedback mechanism in which diencephalon is a place where processes are crossed.",

      "title": "Difficulties in the diagnosis of depression in somatic and neurological practice: clinical observation",
      "abstract": "Depression often develops on a background of somatic and neurological conditions, but the relationship and mutual influence of these disorders can be different. Depression can be exogenous-organic in the context of somatic and neurological diseases; it can be a nosogenic reaction to the disease. In somatic and neurological patients, endogenous depression can be observed as a comorbid depressive episode of a recurrent depressive disorder or a bipolar affective disorder. However, patients' somatic complaints often mask the psychopathological picture of the depression and make its diagnosis more difficult. Conversely, depression can trigger or aggravate somatic condition via psychosomatic mechanisms, which is of great importance for the care providers of these patients. To illustrate the above, we present a clinical observation in which a patient with a history of two traumatic brain injuries with subsequent hospitalizations, long-term alcohol abuse, hepatitis B and C, accompanied by antiviral therapy, was diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder (current episode – depressive hypochondriacal). Difficulties in the diagnosis of depression, aetiopathogenetic and therapeutic aspects are discussed.",

Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

(1)In this article, we describe the management of depression in primary care.This follows earlier articles that discussed the diagnosis of major depression and the important differentials to consider when a patient presents with low mood, (2) and the assessment of suicide risk. (3) HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?By applying the criteria described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), as well as using screening tools in at-risk patients, (1) the primary care physician can establish the diagnosis of major depression.Despite this, it has been shown that more than two-thirds of persons with mental health disorders do not seek help. (4)Barriers to obtaining care include lack of financial means (e.g.having no Medisave accounts), stigma and lack of primary care involvement in the care of persons with mental disorders. (5)As primary care practitioners are accessible and can provide continuity of care and foster long-term relationships with the patient, they are in a unique position to manage depression and should be familiar with the principles and modalities of treatment. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Be familiar with the principles and modalities of depression managementManagement aims to achieve and maintain remission of symptoms as well as full functional recovery. (6)Treatment should be holistic, based on the biopsychosocial and lifestyle model; (7) this can include medication, psychological treatment (e.g.legitimising the illness and facilitating acceptance of the diagnosis), social treatment (e.g.helping the patient to deal with issues of stigma and discrimination, harnessing resources such as support groups and family members) and lifestyle changes (e.g.identifying and managing stressors, managing comorbidities such as substance misuse), as well as managing concomitant medical illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.(9) However, the primary care physician should also bear in mind that clinical guidelines serve as a guide and should not replace their own clinical judgment, and treatment should be individualised as much as possible to cater to the patient's best interest.The algorithm in Fig. 1 summarises the approach to the treatment of depression in primary care and the next section describes the various modalities of treatment available in primary care.",

      "title": "Moral Injury, Trance and Possession State or a Schizophrenic Illness. a Case report",
      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "abstract": "The term functional somatic syndrome (FSS) refers to several related syndromes characterized chiefly by symptoms, suffering, and disability and the absence of disease-specific, demonstrable structural or functional abnormalities. Dizziness is a common symptom of FSS. Generally, clinical examination in these cases is inconclusive. The complaints of these patients usually persist until a satisfactory treatment is administered. For the treatment of cases with FSS, first, signs of underlying psychological distress should be identified during history taking. It is essential to address the psychosocial aspect in these cases from a medical point of view. Drug therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is therefore prescribed. Next, psychotherapy should be introduced. The final strategy usually is to collaborate with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

His history included EDS with sleep attacks, hallucinations, frequent cataplexy and occasional sleep paralysis. Patient’s psychomotor development was normal and clinical history unremarkable; in particular, he denied infectious or inflammatory cerebral diseases, head trauma and exposure to toxic agents. During his NC history, the patient underwent several drug treatments (methylphenidate, modafinil, dexedrine, imipramine) with partial benefit on EDS and cataplexy. At that time, he presented the typical HLA haplotype (HLA DQB1 * 0602), undeDear Sir, Narcolepsy (NC) is a sporadic hypersomnia (prevalence 1: 2,000), characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks, typically associated with cataplexy and other REM-sleep related phenomena such as sleep paralysis and hallucinations [1] . In human NC with cataplexy, an association with specific HLA haplotype (DR DQB1 0602) and a deficiency in hypocretin (orexin) peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are almost constant findings. The pathogenesis of human NC is still unknown. Autoimmune and neurodegenerative processes of hypothalamic structures have been discussed with more solid evidence for the first theory [2–4] . Most of narcoleptic symptoms develop early after the onset of the disease and usually do not worsen with the progression of the neurodegeneration [2] . Moreover, the absence of ubiquitinated inclusions (cardinal neuropathological finding of most neurodegenerative diseases) in narcoleptic patients argues against the neurodegenerative hypothesis in NC [3] . An autoimmune process involving the hypocretin neurons of lateral hypothalamus has been postulated [4] . There are few reports in the literature showing the occurrence of NC-like symptoms in patients already affected by Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases [2, 5–7] .

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders.

      "title": "Schizophrenia and Risk of Dementia: A Literature Review.",
      "abstract": "Introduction Dementia is a clinical syndrome affecting 1-2% of the population under the age of 65, while at older ages the frequency doubles every five years. The clinical manifestations include memory loss, communication deficits, agnosia, apraxia and executive dysfunction.Schizophrenia is a complex, chronic mental disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population, presenting with disturbances in perception, thought and behavior. Objectives To investigate the relationship between schizophrenia and later-onset dementia; more specifically to explore whether schizophrenia increases the dementia risk. Methods A review of 35 articles -from 2010 to 2023- on PubMed and Google Scholar regarding patients with schizophrenia or other type of psychosis, who later presented dementia. Results Patients with a history of schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, or delusional disorder are more likely to develop dementia.The greatest risk is presented in patients showing the shortest duration of psychotic symptoms (5 years or less), while at 5-10 years the probability of developing dementia decreases.The most common types of dementia occurring in psychotic patients are alzheimer’s disease (50-70%),vascular dementia (30%) and unspecified dementia (15%).Chronic patients (10+ years of symptomatology) are less likely to develop dementia. Psychotic patients over the age of 65 are more likely to develop dementia later in life, while individuals who develop schizophrenia after their 40s are three to four times more likely to present dementia compared to patients carrying a schizophrenia diagnosis before their 40s.Females with Late-Onset Schizophrenia have an increased dementia risk compared to males carrying the same diagnosis and compared to healthy females of the same age. Physical conditions implicated in the onset of dementia in schizophrenic patients include cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, substance and alcohol use, head injuries and diabetes. Conclusions According to data, there is a strong correlation between schizophrenia and dementia.However, the related studies are limited in number, while their results require further investigation because of limitations (small sample sizes, co-morbidities, selection of chronic elderly patients).Furthermore, most of these studies were conducted in Western countries, highlighting the necessity of pursuing additional research.

      "abstract": "Episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik merupakan bentuk dari depresi berat yang disertai gejala psikotik yang khas seperti waham atau delusi non-bizarre nihilistik, somatik, kemiskinan, ketidakberhargaan, atau adanya keyakinan-keyakinan delusional tentang perasaan bersalah dan sedang dihukum, serta kadang-kadang muncul halusinasi. Keyakinan-keyakinan delusional pada penderita episode depresif dengan gejala psikotik merupakan suatu distorsi kognitif, sebuah pola berpikir yang rancu dan menimbulkan kesalahan secara negatif yang meningkatkan kerentanan terhadap depresi. Studi kasus ini mengkaji klien yang didiagnosis episode depresif berat dengan gejala psikotik dari sudut pandang psikologi dengan pendekatan Teori Kognitif Beck. Seorang laki-laki bernama G, berusia 45 tahun mengurung diri dan tidak mau bertemu dengan saudara-saudaranya. Klien tidak mau mandi serta tidak shalat. Klien merasa ia tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagi. Menurut kakak, adik ipar, dan istri klien, klien pernah mengalami kecelakaan ketika bekerja di pabrik dan saat mengendarai sepeda motor sehingga kondisi fisiknya menurun. Klien lalu mendapatkan pemutusan hubungan kerja. Kondisi kejiwaannya terganggu. Hasil integrasi tes psikologi menunjukkan bahwa klien memiliki depresi dan kecemasan berlebihan. Teori kognitif Beck mengenai depresi mencantumkan tiga aktivitas kognitif yang mendasari munculnya sebuah gangguan, yaitu: a) negative triad (pandangan pesimistik terhadap diri sendiri, dunia, dan masa depan); b) skema atau keyakinan negatif yang dipicu oleh peristiwa/ situasi kehidupan negatif; dan c) distorsi kognitif. Negative triad berupa pandangan klien bahwa ia telah gagal, sedang dihukum, dan tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa di masa depan. Skema atau keyakinan negatif klien, yaitu meyakini bahwa karena sakitnya yang dialaminya tersebut membuatnya tidak berdaya. Distorsi Kognitif dalam bentuk overgeneralisasi, yaitu â€œSaya tidak bisa melakukan apa-apa lagiâ€. Â  Kata Kunci: depresi, gejala psikotik, keyakinan delusional, Teori Kognitif Beck, negative triad Â  Severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a form of major depression accompanied by typical psychotic symptoms such as delusions or nihilistic, non-bizarre delusions, somatic, poverty, worthlessness, or delusional beliefs about guilt and being punished, and sometimes appear hallucination. Delusional beliefs in people with depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms are a cognitive distortion, a pattern of thinking that is ambiguous and negatively causes errors that increase susceptibility to depression. This case study discusses clients diagnosed with severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms from a psychological perspective with Beckâ€™s Cognitive Theory approach. A 45-year-old man named G locked himself in and didn't want to see his brothers and sisters. Clients did not want to shower and did not pray. The client feels he could not do anything According to the brother, sister-in-law, and client's wife, the client had an accident while working in a factory and while riding a motorcycle so that his physical condition declined. The client then gets terminated in work. His mental condition is disturbed. The results of the integration of psychological tests show that the client has depression and excessive anxiety. Beck's cognitive theory of depression lists three cognitive activities that underlie the emergence of a disorder, namely: a) negative triads (pessimistic views of yourself, the world, and the future); b) negative schemes or beliefs triggered by negative life events/ situations; and c) cognitive distortion. Negative triad is the client's view that he has failed, is being punished, and cannot do anything in the future. The client's negative schema or belief, which is to believe that because of the pain he is experiencing makes him helpless. Cognitive Distortion in the form of overgeneralization, which is I can't do anything else.

      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders are conventionally divided into 2 major categories: 1) Hyperkinetic movement disorders (also called dyskinesias) refers to excessive, often repetitive, involuntary movements that intrude into the normal flow of motor activity. This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. 2) Hypokinetic movement disorders refers to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the primary hypokinetic movement disorder. Movement disorders may be further categorized into primary and secondary disorders. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, a broader structural, toxic, metabolic, or inherited etiologic factor is responsible for the symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is an abnormal emotion which resembles fear subjectively but differs from it in its persistence when the cause of the emotion is no longer apparent to the patient or appears inadequate to account for the symp- toms experienced.It is abnormal by the criteria we apply to illness generally-namely, that the patient is called to bear an unreasonable amount of discomfort and is disabled to a varying degree in his work and in his capacity to maintain satisfactory social relationships.Thus the definition of the term excludes the normal or physiological response to the buffets of everyday life, and in practice there is no difficulty in distinguishing the two.A distinction must also be made between anxiety the symptom, which may colour a number of syndromes, and the anxiety state, which is a fairly clearly demarcated syndrome with anxiety as its principal symptom.When anxiety is very severe it overflows into the muscular system, with the production of gross motor",

The clinical course of Alzheimer's disease begins with a long preclinical state during which individuals have no symptoms, although biological markers may reveal the presence of the disease. Behavioral manifestations are common throughout the course of Alzheimer's disease, including changes in personality, depression, anxiety, paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, and aggressive behavior. Emotional and behavioral symptoms are common throughout the course of the disease and may appear early. Depression and depressive symptoms are common, especially early in the course of the disease. Alzheimer's disease presents as a slow, insidious deterioration in cognitive functioning. Patients with Alzheimer's disease experience an unrelenting, progressive deterioration over years.",

For this reason some physicians prefer the term of addiction to drug. Unlike the benign addiction, by conditioning, drugs addiction initiates very fast (after 1 or 2 intakes), had a big resistance at treatment and show the phenomena of sever disturbance in withdrawal. In this paper we refer mainly at this kind of dependency. Nervous disturbances that are produced during drugs and even alcohol intakes refer to psychical affective and cognitive processes.

The criteria for a diagnosis of it is a duration of at least one week, elated or irritable mood, and at least two of the following: hyperactivity, \"push of speech\", flight of ideas, gradiosity, decreased sleep, distractibility, and lack of judgement. Depressive state is often observed in infarction, infection, neoplasm, head injury and degenerative disease.

Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

Psychological and behavioral hindrances in these patients affect concentration, perception, and ideation to the extent that social and occupational functioning is impaired (30). Symptoms range from hallucinations, disorganized thinking, distorted perception of reality, severe anxiety, difficulty performing work, and many others. This complex mental health disorder afflicts 1.1% (2.4 million) of U.S. population, which constitutes approximately 10% of the disabled (24, 28). Although schizophrenia affects men and women equally, the age of onset is typically between 18 to 24 in males and 24 to 34 in females (28, 30). Patients are usually treated with first- or second-generation antipsychotic medications (24). Long-term use of these medications is often required, in addition to continuous support of the caregivers and/or family members as about half of all people with schizophrenia have significant impairments in self-care skills.",

      "title": "Cytochrome p4502D6 and Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism in Patient with Bipolar Disorder Type II",
      "abstract": "IntroductionBipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psychiatric entity, which represents a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. The very definition and classification of BD is determined by a range of possible clinical presentations, which are sometimes difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric entities by means of a differential diagnosis, for example acute schizophrenic episode, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. Furthermore, BD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse disorders, but also personality disorders or eating disorders, [1-4] which complicate the diagnosis and treatment further.BD can manifest itself for years with recurring depressive episodes before the first manic, hypomanic or mixed episode occurs. The depressive episode of the BD thus frequently remains unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a major depressive disorder (MDD), and therefore inadequately treated with antidepressant monotherapy. According to the current psychiatric classification DSM-V, BD is not diagnosed before an occurrence of a manic or hypomanic episode, while ICD-10 describes, besides a manic and hypomanic episode, a mixed episode in BD as well. [5,6] However, a clinician can consider bipolar depression based on clinical characteristic of depressive episodes. Disease onset before the age of 20, recurrent depressive episodes, which cause the person to be ill most of the time, failure to respond to antidepressants, severe psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia, increased appetite, presence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideations are frequently present in patients with bipolar depression. [7,8]Data on prevalence of mood disorders is significantly changing in the last decade. According to past epidemiological data, BD I is responsible for about 2% of prevalence among mood disorders, in the same percentage as BD II. MDD has been diagnosed in 86% of all patients with mood disorders, and non-specific mood disorder in 10% of the patients. Today, we believe that MDD represents 50 % of all mood disorders, BD I about 2%, BD II 15%, while 33% of mood disorders belong to a heterogeneous group of disorders from the bipolar spectrum. [9] Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the pharmaco-therapeutic approach and introduce mood stabilizers to the treatment if BD or a disorder from the bipolar spectrum is suspected. Special attention should be paid to symptoms of the depressive episode, and all medical history data on patients with depression should be carefully analyzed for evidence of possible episodes of elevated mood in the past.Clinical research has shown that the individual therapeutic response to psychotropic drugs considerably varies, from tendency to develop side effects to therapeutic resistance. In the treatment of a depressive episode, about one third of the patients show no therapeutic response after an adequate therapeutic trial. [8] It is a well known fact the therapeutic response can be affected by different factors, such as the age of the patient, liver or kidney dysfunction, diet, smoking or excessive alcohol use. Recent research shows the lack of response to antidepressant treatment is associated with bipolar disorder, [10] and the association of other psychopathological phenomena with the lack of therapeutic response is also being investigated. However, it is believed that the genetic basis is of key importance for the variability of response to antidepressants. [11,12] Pharmacogenetics studies the influence of specific gene polymorphisms, which are responsible for the function of enzymes important in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.Biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs in the liver occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) superfamily, which consists of more than 50 different enzymes. CYP2D6 has an important role in biotransformation of a large number of antidepressants. [13,14] The gene that encodes the CYP2D6 is located at the locus 22q13. …",

Pueden jugar un papel en estos sindromes, algunas anormalidades cromosomicas. Las soluciones ni son simples ni uniformes en los diferentes sindromes, que algunas veces se asocian con patologias conocidas como el sindrome de Down, rubeola congenita, sindromes de Rett o de la X fragil, embriopatia por valproato, etc. Para hacer un diagnostico de autismo, el DSM-IV –de la Asociacion Americana de Psiquiatria- indica que es necesario encontrar las siguientes caracteristicas: A. Un total de seis o mas manifestaciones de (1), (2) y (3), con l menos dos de (1), al menos una de (2), y al menos una de (3). 1. Trastorno cualitativo de la relacion, expresado como minimo en dos de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Trastorno importante en muchas conductas de relacion no verbal, como la mirada a los ojos, la expresion facial, las posturas corporales y los gestos para regular la interaccion social. b. Incapacidad para desarrollar relaciones con iguales adecuadas al nivel de desarrollo. c. Ausencia de conductas espontaneas encaminadas a compartir placeres, intereses o logros con otras personas (por ejemplo, de conductas de senalar o mostrar objetos de interes). d. Falta de reciprocidad social o emocional.  2. Trastornos cualitativos de la comunicacion, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Retraso o ausencia completa de desarrollo del lenguaje oral (que no se intenta compensar con medios alternativos de comunicacion, como los gestos o mimica). b. En personas con habla adecuada, trastorno importante en la capacidad de iniciar o mantener conversaciones. c. Empleo estereotipado o repetitivo del lenguaje, o uso de un lenguaje idiosincrasico. d. Falta de juego de ficcion espontaneo y variado, o de juego de imitacion social adecuado al nivel de desarrollo. 3. Patrones de conducta, interes o actividad restrictivos, repetitivos y estereotipados, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Preocupacion excesiva por un foco de interes (o varios) restringido y estereotipado, anormal por  su intensidad o contenido. b. Adhesion aparentemente inflexible a rutinas o rituales especificos y no funcionales. c. Estereotipias motoras repetitivas (por ejemplo, sacudidas de manos, retorcer los dedos, movimientos complejos de todo el cuerpo, etc.). d. Preocupacion persistente por partes de objetos. B. Antes de los tres anos, deben producirse retrasos o alteraciones en una de estas tres areas: (1) Interaccion social, (2) Empleo comunicativo del lenguaje o (3) Juego simbolico.  C.

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Uncertainty in illness is a condition that accompanies the patient from the moment of appearance of the first somatic symptoms of the disease and could be strengthened or weakened thanks to many psychosocial factors. The level of uncertainty is related to the level of stress, emotional disadaptation, affective states, coping strategies, mechanisms of psychological defense, etc. Uncertainty can perform destructive functions, acting as a trigger for stressful conditions and launching negative emotional experiences. As a positive function of uncertainty, one can note a possible positive interpretation of the patient's disease.

      "abstract": "La schizophrenie atteint 1% de la population mondiale et est responsable de nombreuses depenses de sante. La schizophrenie recouvre une importante heterogeneite clinique. Aucun symptome n’est caracteristique de ce trouble. Il n’existe a ce jour aucun examen biologique ou radiologique pathognomonique de cette affection. Le diagnostic repose donc sur un faisceau d’arguments cliniques et, en particulier, sur l’association de trois grandes dimensions de symptomes : positifs, negatifs et desorganises. Leur presence doit etre observee pendant une duree suffisante et induire un impact fonctionnel majeur. Il existe une 4e dimension dite neurocognitive. En effet, 70 a 80% des patients schizophrenes souffrent de troubles cognitifs en particulier de l’attention, de la memoire et des fonctions executives. La stabilite des symptomes dans le temps permet de distinguer la schizophrenie des pathologies mentales cycliques. De meme l’association de symptomes positifs a des symptomes negatifs et/ou a une desorganisation permet de distinguer la schizophrenie d’un trouble delirant. Enfin, il est important de savoir rechercher un diagnostic differentiel organique devant une suspicion clinique de schizophrenie. La schizophrenie est associee a une morbi-mortalite medicale importante avec une esperance de vie diminuee de 10 a 15 ans. Le traitement de la schizophrenie est necessaire pour eviter les rechutes et minimiser les consequences sociales de la maladie. Le traitement du premier episode schizophrenique est essentiel pour limiter le handicap a long terme. Les neuroleptiques (NL) sont le principal traitement de la schizophrenie. Les NL de premiere generation (NLPG) ou typiques et de facon plus recente les NL de deuxieme generation (NLDG) ou atypiques sont efficaces sur les symptomes positifs. Neanmoins les NLPG sont responsables plus frequemment d’effets indesirables, notamment de syndromes extra-pyramidaux et de dyskinesies tardives, que les NLDG tandis que ces derniers entrainent une prise de poids plus importante. Les syndromes parkinsoniens iatrogenes (ou drug induced parkinsonism « DIP ») sont frequemment decrits chez des patients traites par neuroleptique et se developpent lors de l’exposition aux NL. Apres arret des drogues, la majorite des patients voit leurs symptomes regresser en quelques mois. Mais dans certains cas, les patients ne recuperent pas suggerant un possible developpement d’une veritable maladie de Parkinson (MP). Plusieurs questions se posent devant ces observations. Comment distinguer les syndromes parkinsoniens iatrogenes des veritables MP ? Les schizophrenes developpent-ils une MP ou ont-ils un stade preclinique parkinsonien revele par les NL ? Les NL sont-ils toxiques a long terme sur la voie nigrostriee ? Si oui, est-ce que certaines classes sont plus toxiques que d’autres ? Chez des schizophrenes avec syndrome parkinsonien et des anomalies au DAT scan, peut-on envisager une DOPA therapie au risque de les aggraver sur le plan psychiatrique? Quelles hypotheses pouvons-nous faire ? Premierement, certaines caracteristiques cliniques permettent de diagnostiquer un DIP plutot qu’une MP : syndrome parkinsonien bilateral, presence de dyskinesies bucco-linguo-masticatoires. Deuxiemement, meme si apres arret des NL, la majorite des patients voit leur DIP s’ameliorer en quelques mois, une minorite d’entre eux voit leurs symptomes parkinsoniens persister voir s’aggraver suggerant l’hypothese d’une degenerescence de la voie nigrostriee . Cette hypothese est confortee par la realisation d’etudes qui ont montre des anomalies a la scintigraphie cerebrale utilisant des radioligands agonistes dopaminergiques ou du transporteur presynaptique (DAT scan) chez des patients schizophrenes exposes a des agents bloqueurs des recepteurs dopaminergiques ayant developpe un syndrome parkinsonien suggerant l’hypothese d’une denervation dopaminergique presynaptique en dehors d’un bl! ocage des recepteurs post synaptiques D2 induit par les NL. Troisiemement, des etudes suggerent une possible neurotoxicite des NL sur les neurones dopaminergiques aboutissant a la mort neuronale. Pour aller plus loin cette neurotoxicite s’exprimerait chez des patients avec une susceptibilite genetique. Ceci pouvant expliquer le haut pourcentage de patients developpant un syndrome parkinsonien apres exposition aux NL parmi ceux avec DIP mais aussi le developpement d’une MP chez des patients traites auparavant par des NL mais n’ayant pas developpe de syndrome parkinsonien sous NL. Les deux objectifs de notre etude sont, dans un premier temps, de faire la synthese de la litterature sur les mouvements anormaux chez des patients schizophrenes, notamment le syndrome parkinsonien iatrogene, et, dans un second temps, d’analyser les donnees de patients schizophrenes suivis dans les differents Centres de Reference francais de la schizophrenie.",

From an anatomical standpoint dysphagia may result from oropharyngeal or esophageal dysfunction and from other structure-related or functional causes from a pathophysiological viewpoint. The prevalence of oropharyngeal functional dysphagia is very high in patients with neurological disease: it includes more than 30% of patients having had a CVA; its prevalence in Parkinson’s disease is 52-82%; it is the first symptom for 60% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); it affects 40% of patients with myasthenia gravis, up to 44% of patients with multiple sclerosis; up to 84% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and more than 60% of elderly institutionalized patients (1-5). The severity of oropharyngeal dysphagia may vary from moderate difficulty to complete inability to swallow. Oropharyngeal dysphagia may give rise to two groups of clinically relevant complications: 1. When a decrease in deglutition efficacy occurs, patients present with malnutrition and/or dehydration. 2. When a decrease in deglutition safety occurs, choking and airway obstruction develop, most commonly as a tracheobronchial aspiration that may result in pneumonia in 50% of cases, with an associated mortality up to 50% (1).",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "Pendahuluan: Penyakit Parkinson (PP) memiliki dimensi gejala sangat luas yang secara langsung dan tidak langsung mempengaruhi kualitas hidup penderita maupun keluarga. Gejala non motorik PP diantaranya adalah gangguan neuropsikiatri seperti depresi, psikosis, ansietas. Kami melaporkan sebuah kasus PP dengan gejala psikotik berupa halusinasi yang jarang dijumpai. Laporan Kasus: Pasien perempuan berusia 74 tahun terdiagnosis Parkinson sejak lebih dari 20 tahun, dibawa ke rumah sakit dengan bicara tidak nyambung, adanya halusinasi visual, dan emosi yang tidak stabil sejak 1 bulan. Keluarga pasien juga merasa sejak 6 bulan terakhir pasien menjadi sering lupa. Pasien dengan riwayat PP tidak rutin mengkonsumsi obat parkinson di bawah supervisi dokter. Keluhan halusinasi pernah dirasakan 2 tahun lalu namun membaik setelah perawatan. Diskusi: Gejala non motorik dapat dijumpai seiring perkembangan penyakit Parkinson dandapat diidentifikasi sebelum sindrom motor muncul. Adanya gejala psikosis berupa halusinasi dalam kasus yang dipaparkan terhadi setelah 18 tahun sejak pasien terdiagnosis, dimana berdasarkan hasil studi terdahulu dilaporkan 60% penderita PP berkembang adanya halusinasi atau delusi setelah 12 tahun perawatan dan pada usia lebih tua saat onset PP. Gangguan kognitif pada PP juga dicurigai dalam kasus walau belum sepenuhnya dapat ditegakan serta adanya gangguan tidur pada PP dengan prevalensi 40-90% dijumpai pada kasus yang kami laporkan. Kesimpulan: Manifestasi non motorik PP yang mencakup gejala neuropsikiatri sangat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pasien maupun keluarga dan perawat pasien. Klinisi harus meningkatkan kewaspadaan terhadap gejala non motorik PP dan pemberian tatalaksana farmakologi dan non farmakologi harus dilakukan secara terintegratif bersama dengan bidang-bidang terkait sesuai dengan kondisi pasien.

People who have BD comprise more than 1% of the world’s population from all nationalities, ethnic origins, and socioeconomic statuses. There are four different types of bipolar-related disorders: bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II, cyclothymic disorder, and unspecified BD, which are classified by different patterns of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes. Where manic and hypomanic episodes are both states of increased activity, energy, or agitation, hypomanic episodes only last around four consecutive days and are less severe compared to manic episodes, which last around one week. Depressive episodes are characterised by feelings of despair and a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. Like many other psychological disorders, BD is often difficult to diagnose accurately in clinical practice due to large variations in individual symptoms, symptom overlap, or lack of approved biomarkers. Additionally, because many patients with BD only seek treatment for depressive episodes, many BD patients are initially misdiagnosed. Two studies conducted in 1999 and 2000 found that nearly 40% of patients with BD are initially diagnosed with unipolar depression. Previous diagnosis criteria for the types of BD were also overly restrictive. For example, according to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-4) criteria, bipolar disorder II requires an episode of mania or hypomania lasting four days, even though many experts believe that the average duration of the hypomanic state ranges between one to three days. Moreover, it is often difficult to elicit a past history of hypomanic episodes from patients because of its milder presentation. For many patients, the increased energy and activity experienced during hypomanic episodes may not even be considered negative, and thus will go unreported. Currently, the DSM-5 contains the most widely acknowledged diagnostic classifications for bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells. Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.",

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

      "abstract": "Women are about twice more likely than men to suffer from depression. it has been hypothesized that reproductive events (i.e., premenstrual, pre and postpartum, menopausal transition) may represent vulnerability periods for depression, in part because of a heightened sensitivity to intense hormonal fl uctuations. 1) Most women report physical or emotional symptoms premenstrually, some being severe enough to be diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); some recent studies suggest that PMDD is biologically different from major depression; 2) While pregnancy does not increase the risk for depression, women with a past history of depression are at risk for recurrent episodes or relapse if antidepressant medications are discontinued; 3) Hormonal changes during the postpartum period may trigger symptoms of postpartum depression; 4) Almost half of perimenopausal women are clinically depressed, and over a third experience their fi rst episode of depression in the perimenopausal period.The increase in major depressive episodes during this period has been linked to erratic gonadal hormonal changes.",

      "title": "Cognitive disorders in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Currently, there is evidence that schizophrenia is associated with impairment of many cognitive functions (Green M.F. et al., 2004). They are found in healthy relatives of the first degree of kinship, in patients - already in childhood, in the premorbid condition of the disease, most clearly manifested in high-risk states - psychopathological diathesis (Sheinina N.S., Kotsyubinsky A.P., Skorik A.I., Chumachenko A.A., 2008; Sofronov A.G., Spikina A.A., Savelyev A.P., Pashkovsky V.E., 2011). In the prodromal period of schizophrenia, there is an increase in cognitive deficit associated with morphological and functional changes in the brain, which leads to the development of psychosis (Yanushko M.G. et al., 2014; Welham J. et al., 2009), during which cognitive disorders persist (Lesh TA et al., 2011). Patients with endogenous psychosis, already at the first hospitalization, have impaired cognitive functioning, and in patients with schizophrenia they are most pronounced (Reichenberg A. et al., 2009). While in the ICD-10 cognitive impairments are noted only sporadically as diagnostic criteria (for example, speech impoverishment in schizophrenia), the DSM-V emphasizes the clinical importance of cognitive dysfunctions for verifying psychiatric diagnoses (APA, 2013). The possibility of including cognitive impairments in the number of diagnostic signs of schizophrenia was considered, which was rejected due to the lack of sufficient data to differentiate cognitive function in schizophrenia and other disorders. Cognitive deficits, for which effective remedies are currently lacking (Vingerhoets WA et al., 2013), are associated with the problems of social functioning of patients and functional outcome (Sofronov A.G. et al., 2012; Milev P. et al., 2005) ; Prouteau A. et al., 2005; Torrey EF, 2006), prognosis of schizophrenia (Kahn and Keefe, 2013).",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Delusional infestation (DI), also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom syndrome, is a rare disorder, characterised by fixed belief that the skin, body or immediate environment is infested by small pathogens, despite the lack of any medical evidence for it. Objectives To describe and discuss two clinical cases of DI, in order to show two different ways of presenting in this entity. Methods Two case report and non-systematic review. Results We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, without psychiatric history, with an DI with 5 years of evolution, referred to a psychiatric consultation by a dermatologist. The second case, is a 41-year-old woman with a history of multiple substance use disorder, with an DI with a month of evolution, who resorted to the emergency department. DI is not a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, as represented in the first case,is a primary form, which develops without any known cause or underlying disease, corresponding to a persistent delusional disorder. However, about 60% of patients have secondary forms of DI, in the context of substance misuse, some medications or in the course of physical or psychiatric diseases (e.g. stroke, delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia). Conclusions DI can occur as a primary delusional disorder or secondary to several other medical conditions. An in-depth clinical history is essential in order to make the correct diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach is also important, to exclude any possible organic etiology, not forgetting that many patients may turn to other medical specialities first.

      "abstract": "Every illness represents in some way a threat and increases the sense of vulnerability. The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "INTISARI Latar Belakang: Schizophrenia merupakan suatu penyakit otak persisten dan serius yang mengakibatkan perilaku psikotik, pemikiran konkret, dan kesulitan dalam memproses informasi, hubungan interpersonal, serta memecahkan masalah.Schizophrenia biasanya dimulai pada akhir masa remaja atau dewasa awal dan mempengaruhi lebih dari 21 juta orang di seluruh dunia.Prevalensi gangguan jiwa berat di Indonesia menunjukkan bahwa gangguan jiwa berat tertinggi adalah di DIY dan Aceh dengan persentase 2,7%. Pada pasien dengan  schizophreniakemandirian Activity Daily Living (ADL) dan kualitas hidup akan terpengaruh. Kemandirian klien gangguan jiwa adalah suatu kemampuan klien gangguan jiwa dalam memenuhi kebutuhan dasar atau tugas pokok sehari-hari tanpa bantuan orang lain. Selain kemandirian Activity Daily Living (ADL) kualitas hidup juga mempengaruhi pasien schizophrenia dalam menjalani kehidupannya.Kualitas hidup merupakan pandangan atau pendapat subjektif pasien dalam memberikan penghargaan diri terhadap kepuasan pribadinya.Kualitas hidup pasien, dapat menjadi acuan keberhasilan dari suatu tindakan, intervensi, treatment atau terapi yang dilakukan. Tujuan: Mengetahui hubungan kemandirian Activity Daily Living (ADL) dengan kualitas hidup pada pasien schizophrenia di PoliKlinik Jiwa RSJ Grhasia DIY. Metode Penelitian: Jenispenelitian ini adalah deskriptif analitik dengan  pendekatancross sectional. Sampel pada penelitian ini berjumlah 91 pasien dengan diagnosa schizophreniadi PoliKlinik Jiwa RSJ Grhasia DIY.Teknik sampling yang digunakan adalah nonprobability sampling, metode yang digunakan adalah accidental sampling  dengan teknik analisa data menggunakan Spearman rank.Alat pengumpulan data menggunakan kuesioner. Hasil: Kemandirian Activity Daily Living (ADL) pasien schizophrenia, sebagian besar dalam kategori sedang yaitu 59,3%. Kualitas hidup pada pasien schizophrenia, sebagian besar dalam kategori tinggi yaitu sebesar 54,9%. Hasil uji statistik dengan Spearman rank diperoleh nilai dengan p-value = 0,000, keeratan hubungan yaitu lemah dengan arah positif (r = 0,390). Kesimpulan: Ada hubungan kemandirian Activity Daily Living (ADL) dengan kualitas hidup pada pasien schizophrenia di PoliKlinik Jiwa RSJ Grhasia DIY.

Anxiety-related disorders include generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias; they are characterised by the presence of clinically significant degrees of chronic anxiety in response to perceived threatening stimuli. Psychotic disorders are characterised by loss of contact with reality and include symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganised speech and/or behaviour. The main class of psychiatric disorders is substance use disorders (SUDs), typified by compulsive and impulsive drug-seeking and taking behaviours. Patients with these psychiatric disorders have been found to demonstrate common symptomatologies, including impairments in cognitive functioning that make them good candidates for neuropsychological rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Mental illnesses are common. They occur in people of all ages, and can be found in every culture and racial group. Even though the form in which disorders manifest may be different across cultures and social–cultural differences may affect outcomes significantly, there is a general consensus that the major categories of mental disorders are present among humans wherever they happen to reside. These disorders include unipolar depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol and drug use disorders, post-traumatic disorder, panic disorder, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and primary insomnia. The prevalence of mental disorders is generally higher than that of any other class of chronic condition. However, the burden attributable to mental disorders results not only from their high prevalence, but also from the relatively early age of the onset of the more common types, and the tendency of many mental disorders to be chronic or recurrent. For example, the median age of onset for anxiety disorders is early teenage, and many affected individuals will go on to develop other types of mental disorder in adulthood.",

      "title": "Burnout Syndrome in Professional Workers Who Deal with Treated Alcoholics",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONProfessional stress1 represents an imbalance of workplace requirements and surroundings with our abilities, wishes and expectations concerning fulfilling these requirements. The long-term exposure to professional stress results in the burnout syndrome, the most unfavorable outcome, which affects particularly the helping professions (psychiatrists, social workers, nurses...).2 One of the definitions states that the burnout syndrome is a gradual process in which once a productive and responsible worker loses all interest in his/her work or profession.3 It is a cumulative process that comes with small warning signs. Years can go by till symptoms are manifested as psychological or emotional problems as these signs are often diminutive. The burnout syndrome consists of four stages. The first stage, beginners enthusiasm is characterized by unreal expectations and self-investing of helper followed by high level of energy and good achievements. Second one is a stagnation stage in which helper starts to understand that work isn't as imagined, which is followed by the first appearance of physical and psychological exhaustion, pessimism and a lack of satisfaction with work. Isolation stage is the third stage, characterized by emotional withdrawal, avoiding contacts with colleagues, depression, negativism, angriness and hostility. Syndrome progression continues, sped by physical difficulties (chronic exhaustion, insomnia, headache, allergies etc.). Apathy and a lack of life interests, as a final stage, are the results of chronic frustration and complete lack of interest. Characteristics symptoms are loss of self-confidence, cynicism, serious emotional difficulties, not being able to communicate and work with colleagues and diminished interpersonal relations.4The burnout syndrome can be stopped before the helper arrives at the last stage. The whole process can be turned the other way around by changing the working goals, attitudes and behaviors in the work surroundings,5 as the cause of professional stress can be internal and external.The mental help of professional workers is at risk because of their everyday need to communicate with treated alcoholics, listen to the life problems, traumatic events, losses and similar issues.6 They are mostly unaware of how this line of work affects them and they avoid asking for help. Not recognizing the burnout syndrome, professional workers are themselves at risk of developing a negative attitude towards the treated alcoholics and provide ineffective and inadequate help.Aim of this study was to investigate if professional workers recognized the burnout syndrome in working with treated alcoholics; if professional workers who work with treated alcoholics suffered from burnout syndrome; which profession is the most affected by the burnout syndrome and if there were any differences in social-demographic features and to see used strategies of self-help.METHODS AND SAMPLEThe questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into two parts. The first part referred to professional workers' perception of the burnout syndrome and its causes, and the second part was The Burnout Syndrome Questionnaire1 (appendix).The study included 40 professional workers (doctors, social workers, nurses, psychologist, special teachers),8,9 mainly from the city of Zagreb (Table 1). 40% of them work with treated alcoholics in Departments of Psychiatry in three Zagreb University Hospitals, 37.5% work only in clubs for treated alcoholics and 22.5% work in both. The structure of professional workers in relation to the working place was expected. In hospitals, representation of nurses and doctors was highest, but in clubs for treated alcoholics there were more social workers (Table 2). The mean age of professional workers was 45 years (min. - 24, max - 68), while the mean duration of working with treated alcoholics was 15 years (min. - 1, max. - 40), which means 22 hours per week (min. …",

Hypochondriasis is distinguished from other somatic delusional disorders because this disorder is associated with the experience of physical symptoms experienced by the sufferer, whereas other somatoform disorders do not show physical symptoms in themselves. Symptoms that arise may be an exaggerated statement of physical symptoms, which will actually exacerbate physical symptoms caused by the belief that the patient is sick and in a worse condition than the actual situation. Treatment of hypochondriasis includes recording symptoms, psychosocial review, and psychotherapy. Good prognosis is associated with high socioeconomic status, sudden onset, absence of personality disorders and absence of concomitant non-psychiatric medical conditions.",

Patients suffering primarily from migraine or headache caused by tension are susceptible to this affect due to their massive consumption of medication. The frequent or daily intake of painkillers or migraine medication over periods of weeks or months may lead to a new type of headache characterised by dull, pressure-like and diffuse permanent pain. The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

      "abstract": "Bhutavidya (Ayurvedic psychiatry) is one among the eight specialties of Ayurveda (an ancient Indian system of medicine). Bhutavidya deals with the diseases (psychiatric or neuropsychiatric) caused by \"bhuta\" or \"graha\" (idiopathic factors) and their management. Unmada (broad term which includes various psychiatric conditions) is a disease characterized by deranged mental functions. \"Bhutonmada\" (psychiatric conditions caused by idiopathic factors) is a type of unmada caused by affliction of \"bhuta\" or \"graha.\" Eighteen types of bhutonmada are explained in samhita's (ancient Ayurvedic texts). Previous works have explored these 18 grahonmadas and compared them with various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions. Vishesha or Upa grahonmadas are the subtypes of these 18 grahonmadas, and their description is found only in \"Ashtanga sangraha\" (Ayurvedic textbook of medicine written by Vriddha Vagbhata). Description of 16 \"Vishesha\" or \"Upa grahonmadas\" is available in \"Ashtanga sangraha.\" Till date, no studies have been conducted on Vishesha grahonmadas, and the present study aims at exploring Vishesha grahonmadas with contemporary psychiatric conditions. Ayurvedic literature related to \"Vishesha grahonmadas\" has been collected from major classical Ayurvedic texts and from their commentaries. Electronic databases \"Google\" and \"Google Scholar\" have been searched to find out the relevant studies using appropriate keywords. Sixteen Vishesha grahonmadas explained in Ashtanga sangraha have shown resemblance with various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions such as mood disorders, schizophrenia, frontotemporal dementia, Tourette's syndrome, extra pyramidal movement disorders, temporal lobe epilepsy, autism, personality disorders, Parkinson's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The contemporary perspective of ancient psychiatric concepts as demonstrated in the present article provides new insights and paves way further studies.",

Herein we present 2 patients that had manic episodes induced by gradual cessation of antidepressant drugs. Common features of both cases were as follows: patients were female; a major depressive episode was the reason for starting treatment; familial loading for unipolar depressive disorder; venlafaxine was administered for treatment of the episode; mood elevation symptoms while gradually decreasing the medication dose; absence of physical symptoms related to withdrawal; antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs were required for the treatment of the episode. In both cases 1) a hypomanic/manic episode induced by the use of antidepressants, 2) agitated depression, 3) physical withdrawal syndrome, and 4) spontaneous episodes in the natural course of the illness were the 4 different states that were taken into consideration for differential diagnosis. Hypomanic/manic episodes induced by cessation of antidepressant drugs are thought to shed light on the etiology of bipolar disorder, which this report discusses with reference to the case reports.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "A subject is conscious when he is awake and with an adequate awareness of him and the environment. The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Allostatic Overload Syndrome in Patients with Chronic Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "Allostasis, the ability to maintain stability through change, is a fundamental process through which organisms actively adjust to both predictable and unpredictable events. When allostatic systems are turned on and turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not otherwise survive. However, in a number of circumstances allostatic systems may either be overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has been termed 'allostatic load', or the price of adaptation [1]. Findings from several studies suggest that it is associated with worse health conditions and plays a significant role in the susceptibility, course, and outcome of cardiovascular (CV) diseases [2]. Recently, Fava et al. [3] introduced clinimetric criteria for assessing allostatic overload syndrome (AOS) based on: (a) current identifiable sources of distress in the form of acute or chronic stress (the stressor is judged to tax or exceed the individual's coping skills when its full nature and circumstances are evaluated), and (b) psychiatric symptoms (DSM-IV) or psychosomatic symptoms (DCPR) or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or in psychological well-being occurring within 6 months after the onset of the stressor.This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the AOS of Fava et al. [3] in patients with chronic CV disease and its relationships with psychosomatic syndromes (Structured Interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research; DCPR [4]), psychopathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; SCID [5]), illness representations (Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised; IPQ-R [6]), and psychosocial functioning (12-item Short Form Health Survey; SF-12 [7]). To evaluate AOS, recent and chronic stress, environmental mastery, sleep, somatization, and psychological distress were carefully evaluated in the clinical interview.Consecutive outpatients with essential hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled between January and December 2011. Patients with severe CV comorbidity, psychosis, oncology and autoimmune diseases, cognitive impairment, and current alcohol or any other substance abuse were excluded. For all patients, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure were recorded at the entry. All patients gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Because of refusal to participate, clinical problems, and other difficulties, 116 of 138 patients (84%) entered the study (84 with essential hypertension and 32 with CHD). The clinical characteristics and scale scores of patients with and without AOS are shown in table 1.No differences in CV and sociodemographic variables were found between the two groups, except for younger age in the AOS patients. Patients with AOS showed significant poorer mental functioning (SF-12 MCS), higher scores on the IPQ-R consequences (perception of severity and effects of the illness on individual life) and emotional representations (emotional reactivity to the illness) subscales, and a higher prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses. Furthermore, a 2-fold significant higher prevalence of DCPR clusters of abnormal illness behavior, irritability, and somatization (though the latter was near to statistical significance) was found in the AOS group compared to the comparison group. It is noteworthy that DCPR demoralization was more than 5-fold higher in AOS patients than in those without AOS. Also, the DCPR syndrome of illness denial was diagnosed 3 times more frequently in the AOS (31%) group than in the comparison (10%) group [χ2(1) = 4.82, p = 0.03]. Logistic regression analysis was used with AOS as the dependent variable and DSM and DCPR syndrome illness representation, psychosocial functioning, and sociodemographic characteristics as independent variables. The final model was statistically significant (χ2 = 31.46, p < 0.001; Cox and Snell R2 = 0.24) and AOS was found to be independently predicted by DCPR demoralization [B = 1.807 (SE 0.849); Wald statistic 4.530 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.03; Exp (B) = 6.090 (95% CI 1.154–32.153)] and SF-12 MCS [B = –0.099 (SE 0.040); Wald statistic 5.978 (d.f. = 1), p = 0.01; Exp (B) = 0.906 (95% CI 0.837–0.981)].In this exploratory study we showed for the first time, to our knowledge, the prevalence of AOS in outpatients with chronic CV illness. Within this sample, AOS is characterized by poorer psychosocial functioning, higher rates of psychopathology, and a higher disease-related emotional burden (perception of the impact of the illness on individual life) with associated correlates of abnormal illness behavior, somatization symptoms, and irritability. It is of interest that AOS partially and independently overlapped with demoralization, a feeling state characterized by an inability to cope with problems, hopelessness, and helplessness [8] which may dramatically increase the subjective perception of being overloaded by stressful demands, as shown by the association with the mental component score of SF-12. Recently, Offidani and Ruini [9] found a much higher prevalence of AOS (41%) compared to our results (11%). The marked difference with the report of Offidani and Ruini [9] might be likely due to a number of reasons including sampling (they recruited blood donors on a voluntary basis vs. consecutive CV outpatients), procedure (they recruited healthy volunteers who might be more interested in participating in a psychological evaluation because of experienced distress), age (they recruited younger subjects aged an average of 37 years while our patients had a mean age of 66), work status (more than half of their subjects were employed while two third of our subjects were retired, with a consequent different weight of work-related stress), and assessment instruments (they did not use SCID and DCPR but cut off criteria to self-report scales).Our study includes obvious limitations dues to its preliminary nature such as a limited sample size, cross-sectional design, lack of assessment of biological (e.g. erythrocites, leukocytes, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin), metabolic (waist-hip ratio), and behavioral (smoking status, diet, alcohol, and coffee consumption) data that are relevant for both CV illness and allostatic load. Nonetheless, our findings show that a reliable evaluation of allostatic overload may help to identify those conditions that, by exceeding individual resources, may constitute a danger to health such as demoralization. The relevance of diagnosing AOS is particularly important in cardiology because of the established association of chronic stress with negative prognostic factors. Furthermore, diagnosing AOS may help target treatment to psychological functions enhancing well-being outcomes [10].",

      "title": "Transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "title": "The Grand Mai épilepsies and the Sleeping‐Waking Cycle",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Side by side with the usual classification of minor fits into cortical Jacksonian seizures, rhinencephalic psychomotor fits and centrencephalic fits of the petit mal triad we find another classification of major seizures which is governed by their dependence on or independence of the sleep‐waking cycle. Under this aspect three types of course may be described: (1) grand mal épilepsies with attacks predominantly following waking and during the period of relaxation following work (“Feierabend”), the so‐called awakening epilepsies; (2) grand mal épilepsies with attacks mainly after falling asleep or before waking, the so‐called sleep epilepsies; (3) grand mal épilepsies with irregular dispersed attacks, the so‐called diffuse epilepsies. As a rule these types remain constant even in cases of considerable duration. Transitions occur from awakening epilepsy to sleep epilepsy or to diffuse epilepsy and from sleep epilepsy to diffuse epilepsy, but not vice versa . The described types differ in the following clinical features: 90% of awakening epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 12.5%, and generally start first between the ages of 10 and 25; where they are found in combination they are mostly linked with the petit mal triad; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are in most cases precipitated by lack of sleep and consumption of alcohol. Seventy‐seven percent of sleep epilepsies are cryptogenetic, have a ratio of heredity of 7.7%, and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits; the intervals between fits are to a large extent regular; the fits themselves are but rarely caused by external circumstances. Diffuse epilepsies are mainly symptomatic (53%), have a ratio of heredity of 3.8% and there is no predilection for a particular age; where combined they are mostly linked with psychomotor fits or Jacksonian seizures; the intervals between fits are to a large extent irregular; the fits themselves are precipitated by a variety of factors whose common denominator is found by acute disturbances of the cerebral circulation. Clinical and electroencephalographical investigations have revealed fundamental differences in the sleep behaviour of patients suffering from awakening or from sleep epilepsies, whereas patients suffering from diffuse epilepsies show no special characteristic in this respect. The differences in sleep patterns apply to the quality – insofar as both achieve their deep sleep maxima at different times in the course of the sleep – as well as to the quantity, since patients with sleep epilepsy sleep too much, i.e ., have too much deep sleep whilst patients with epilepsy on awakening sleep too little, i.e ., have too much shallow sleep. To this corresponds a different behaviour during consciousness, which is correlated electroencephalographically in the case of sleep épilepsies – excepting abnormalities peculiar to the disease – with a regular basic rhythm of a constant frequency; in the case of awakening epilepsies, however, it is correlated with a variable EEG, i.e ., unstable in frequency and disturbed in rhythm. Patients with sleep and patients with awakening epilepsy further differ in their psychical behaviour, in their somatic condition, in their vegetative functions, in their development during puberty and in their instinctive behaviour. The author reported in detail on the investigations by Christian and Ganshirt dealing with their EEG‐findings on pure and combined grand mal epilepsies in waking as well as in sleep. They have shown that sleep epilepsies have generally a normal standard EEG with few general abnormalities and hardly react to hyperventilation, whereas in natural sleep they show considerable increase of specific attack potentials, which never consist of spike‐wave‐complexes, but almost exclusively of bilaterally symmetrical or synchronised steep outbursts or temporal peaks. In the case of awakening epilepsies however we discern very frequently general abnormalities already in the standard EEG, as well as diffuse or paroxysmal dysrhythmia or specific attack potentials, which are yet increased during hyperventilation and represent almost exclusively only 3–4/sec spikes and waves or multi‐spikes‐waves. The increase of specific attack findings between the EEG during waking and the sleep EEG amounts to 1: 1.2 in the case of awakening epilepsies and 1: 10 in the case of sleep epilepsies. Diffuse epilepsies are closer to sleep epilepsies as regards their little reaction to hyperventilation, but closer to awakening epilepsies as regards their low rate of increase in specific attack potentials during sleep (1: 1.5). As for the question of the cerebral localisation, which was investigated on the basis of 141 patients with grand mal epilepsies following circumscribed brain injuries and locatable brain tumours, a relationship was found to be probable insofar as frontal brain injuries lead mainly to sleep epilepsy but parietal brain injuries mainly to diffuse epilepsy. No correlations could be established where awakening epilepsies and other localisations are concerned. The biological antagonism between awakening epilepsy and sleep epilepsy is reflected in a different response to antiepileptic drugs. Sleep epilepsies respond well to hydantoins and badly to phenobarbitone, awakening epilepsies respond well to phenobarbitone and only poorly to hydantoins. No particular differences in the effectiveness of mysoline have been shown when adminstered to either type. For diffuse epilepsies there is no medicament of outstanding effectiveness. RÉSUMÉ A côté de la classification usuelle des crises mineures en brusques crises corticales Jacksonniennes, crises psychomotrices rhinencéphaliques et crises centrencéphaliques de la triade du petit mal, nous trouvons une autre classification de crises majeures que gouverne leur indépendance ou leur dépendance du cycle de l'épilepsie sommeil‐vigile. Ainsi présentés on peut décrire trois types de cours de la maladie: (1) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises surviennent en prédominance après le réveil et pendant la période de relaxation qui fait suite au travail (Feierabend“), ces épilepsies sont dites épilepsies du réveil; (2) épilepsies de grand mal dont les crises se produisent principalement apres que le patient se soit endormi ou avant son réveil: épilepsies dites en sommeil; (3) épilepsies de grand mal avec crises se dispersant irrégulièrement, épilepsies dites épilepsies diffuses. Selon la règle, ces types restent constants même dans les cas de très longue durée. II survient des transitions de l'épilepsie du réveil à l'épilepsie en sommeil ou à l'épilepsie diffuse, et de l'épilepsie en sommeil à l'épilepsie diffuse, mais non vice versa . Les types décrits différent selon les traits cliniques suivants: 90% des épilepsies à l'état du réveil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en une proportion de 12.5% et débutent généralement entre 10 et 25 ans; quand on les trouve en combinaison, elles sont le plus souvent en rapport avec la triade du petit mal; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont, dans la plupart des cas, précipitées par un besoin de sommeil ou une consommation d'alcool. Soixantedix‐sept pour cent d'épilepsies à l'état de sommeil sont cryptogénétiques, elles sont héréditaires en 7.7% des cas et ne montrent aucune prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont le plus souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices; les intervalles entre les crises sont en forte mesure réguliers; les crises mêmes ne sont que rarement causées par des circonstances externes. Les épilepsies diffuses sont principalement symptomatiques (53%), leur pourcentage d'hérédité est de 3.8% et elles ne montrent point de prédilection pour un âge quelconque; quand elles sont combinées, elles sont souvent unies à des crises psychomotrices ou des crises Jacksonniennes; les intervalles entre les crises sont fortement irréguliers; les crises mêmes sont précipitées par des facteurs variés dont le dénominateur commun est situé dans un trouble aigu de la circulation cérébrale. Des recherches cljniques et encéphalographiques ont révélé des différences fondamentales dans le comportement du sommeil des malades souffrant d'épilepsies du réveil ou à l'état de sommeil tandis que les épilepsies diffuses ne présentent aucune caractéristique spéciale sous ce rapport. Les différences entre les types du sommeil s'appliquent à la qualité– pour autant que les deux genres achèvent leurs maximums de profond sommeil à différents moments du cours du sommeil – tout aussi bien qu'à la quantité puisque les épileptiques en sommeil dorment trop, c'est‐à‐dire dorment trop d'un sommeil profond, tandis que les épileptiques dont les crises surviennent pendant le réveil dorment trop peu, c'est‐à‐dire qu'ils ont trop de sommeil léger. II correspond à ceci un comportement différent durent l'état conscient, ce qui est en correlation avec l'encéphalogramme en cas d'épilepsie en sommeil – exception faite des anomalies propres à la maladie – avec un rythme de base régulier de fréquence constante; toutefois, en cas d'épilepsie du réveil ce rapport s'établit avec un E.E.G. variable, c'est‐à‐dire de fréquence instable et de rythme troublé. Les malades avec épilepsie en sommeil et ceux avec épilepsie à l'état de veille diffèrent de plus dans leur comportement psychique, dans leur condition somatique, dans leurs fonctions végétatives, dans leur développement au cours de la puberté et dans leur comportement instinctif. L'auteur rapporte en détail les recherches de Christian et Gänshirt qui communiquent leurs découvertes faites dans l'E.E.G. sur les épilepsies pures et combinées de grand mal en épilepsies en vigile tout comme en sommeil. Ils ont démontré que les épilepsies en sommeil ont le plus souvent un standard normal d'E.E.G. avec peu d'anomalies et qu'elles réagissent à peine à l'hyperventilation tandis que, lors de sommeil naturel, elles présentent une augmentation considérable de potentiels de crises spécifiques lesquels ne consistent jamais en des complexes de pointes ondes, mais presque exclusivement en fortes bouffées bilatéralement symétriques ou synchronisées, ou en pointes temporales. Dans les cas d'épilepsie du réveil, toutefois, nous pouvons discerner déjà, très fréquemment, dans l'E.E.G. standard des anomalies générates et aussi des dysrythmies diffuses ou paroxysmales ou des potentiels spécifiques de crises, lesquels sont encore augmentés par l'hyperventilation et ne représented presque exclusivement que des pointes‐ondes de 3–4/sec ou des ondes multi‐pointes. L'augmentation des constatations de crise spécifique qui se produit entre l'E.E.G. à l'état de veille et l'E.E.G. du sommeil comprend 1:1.2 dans les cas d'épilepsies à l'état de veille et 1:10 dans les cas d'épilepsie en sommeil. Les épilepsies diffuses se rapprochent plus des épilepsies en sommeil en ce qui concerne leur légère réaction à l'hyperventilation mais elles sont plus rapprochées de l'épilepsie en vigile en ce qui regarde le peu d'élevation de leur taux d'augmentation en potentiels spécifiques de crises durant le sommeil (1:1.5). Quant a la question de la localisation cérébrale, que nous avons étudiée sur une base de 141 malades ayant des épilepsies de grand mal provenant de lésions cérébrales circonscrites et de tumeurs cérébrates susceptibles de localisation, nous avons trouvé la probabilité d'un rapport pour autant qu'un traumatisme du cerveau frontal conduit principalement à l'épilepsie en sommeil, mais qu'un traumatisme pariétal provoque principalement une épilepsie diffuse. II n'a pu etre établi de corrélation quand il s'agit d'épilepsie en vigile ou de localisations autres. L'antagonisme biologique entre l'épilepsie en vigile et l'épilepsie en sommeil est démontré par différentes réactions à des médicaments antiépileptiques. L'épilepsie pendant le sommeil réagit favorablement à des hydantoines et mal au phénobarbitone; en vigile, l'épilepsie réagit bien au phénobarbitone et mal aux médicaments à l'hydantoine. Des différences particulières dans l'efficacité de la mysoline n'ont pas été observées dans l'administration à l'un ou l'autre type. Quant aux épilepsies diffuses, il n'y a pas de médicaments d'efficacité spéciale. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Der geläufigen Einteilung der kleinen Anfälle in kortikale Jackson‐Anfälle, rhinence‐phale psychomotorische Anfälle und centrencephale Anfälle der Petit‐mal‐Trias wird eine Einteilung der grossen Anfälle zur Seite gestellt, die sich nach der Abhängigkeit oder Unabhängigkeit der grossen Anfälle vom Schlaf‐Wachrhytmus richtet. Unter diesem Aspekt lassen sich 3 Verlaufsformen beschreiben: (1) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Erwachen und während der Entspannungssituation nach der Arbeit (“urn Feierabend”), sog. Aufwachepilepsien; (2) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit Anfällen vorwiegend nach dem Einschlafen und vor dem Aufwachen, sog. Schlafepilepsien; (3) Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien mit unregelmässiger Anfallsverteilung, sog. diffuse Epilepsien. In der Regel bleiben diese Formen auch bei längerem Krankheitsverlauf konstant. Überg̈ange können erfolgen von Aufwach‐ in Schlafoder in diffuse Epilepsien und von Schlaf‐ in diffuse Epilepsien, jedoch nicht in umgekehrter Richtung. Die beschriebenen Formen unterscheiden sich in folgenden klinischen Eigenschaften: Aufwach‐Epilepsien sind zu 90% kryptogen, haben eine Hereditätsquote von 12.5% und beginnen meist zwischen dem 10. und 25. Jahr; in Kombination sind sie meist mit Anfällen der Petit‐mal‐Trias verknüpft; die Anfälle selbst werden vorwiegend durch Schlafdefizit und Alkohol ausgelöst. Schlafepilepsien sind zu 77% kryptogen und zu 23% symptomatisch mit einer Hereditätsquote von 7.7%,; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination sind sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen verknüpft; die Anfallsintervalle sind weitgehend regelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden nur selten durch exogene Umstände ausgelöst. Diffuse Epilepsien sind vorwiegend symptomatisch (53%) mit einer Hereditätsquote von 3,8%; sie haben kein Prädilektionsalter; in Kombination treten sie meist mit psychomotorischen Anfällen oder mit Jackson‐Anfällen auf; die Anfallsintervalle sind unregelmässig; die Anfälle selbst werden durch verschiedenartige Faktoren ausgelöst, deren gemeinsamer Nenner in akuten Regulationsstörungen der Gehirndurchblutung zu suchen ist. Klinische und elektroencephalographische Untersuchungen lassen fundamentale Unterschiede im Schlafverhalten bei Aufwach‐ und bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern erkennen, während Kranke mit einer diffusen Epilepsie in dieser Hinsicht keine charakteristischen Abweichungen bieten. Die Unterschiede betreffen sowohl die Qualität des Schlafs – insofern als beide ihre Tiefschlaf‐Maxima zu verschiedenen Zeiten während des Schlafverlaufs erreichen –, als auch die Quantität, da Patienten mit einer Schlaf‐epilepsie zu viel schlafen, d.h. zu lange tief und Patienten mit einer Aufwachepilepsie zu wenig, d.h. zu lange flach schlafen. Dem entspricht ein verschiedenes Wachverhalten, das elektroencephalographisch bei Schlaf‐Epileptikern – abgesehen von anfallsspezifischen Veränderungen – mit einem regelmässigen, frequenzkonstanten Grundrhythmus und bei Aufwach‐Epileptikern mit einem frequenzlabilen, dysrhythmi‐schen EEG korreliert ist. Kranke mit Aufwach‐ und Kranke mit Schlaf‐Epilepsien unterscheiden sich ferner in ihrem psychischen Verhalten, in ihrer körperlichen Konstitution, ihren vegetativen Funktionen, ihrer Pubertätsentwicklung und ihrem Triebverhalten. Ausführlich referiert werden die EEG‐Untersuchungen von Christian und Gänshirt bei reinen und kombinierten Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien im Wachen wie im Schlaf, die zeigen, dass Schlaf‐Epilepsien meist ein unauffälliges Standard‐EEG mit wenig Allgemeinveränderungen bieten, auf Hyperventilation kaum, im natürlichen Schlaf dagegen mit einer erheblichen Zunahme anfalls‐spezifischer Potentiale reagieren, bei denen es sich nie um spike‐wave‐Komplexe, sondern fast nur um bilateral‐symmetrische oder synchronisierte steile Ausbrüche oder steile Spitzen handelt. Aufwach‐Epilepsien bieten dagegen sehr häufig schon im Standard‐EEG Allgemeinveränderungen, diffuse oder paroxysmale Dysrhythmien oder spezifische Anfallspotentiale, die auf Hyperventilation noch zunehmen und fast ausschliesslich nur 3–4/sec spike‐waves und multi‐spike‐waves darstellen. Der Zuwachs anfallsspezifischer Befunde vom Wach‐zum‐Schlaf‐EEG beträgt bei Aufwach‐Epilepsien 1: 1.2 und bei Schlaf‐Epilepsien 1: 10. Diffuse Epilepsien stehen hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Reaktion auf Hyperventilation den Schlaf‐Epilepsien näher und hinsichtlich ihrer geringen Zuwachsrate anfallsspezifischer Befunde im Schlaf (1: 1.5) den Aufwach‐Epilepsien. Eine hirnlokalisatorische Beziehung liess sich auf Grund von Untersuchungen an 141 Grand‐mal‐Epilepsien nach lokalisierten Hirnverletzungen und ‐Tumoren insofern wahrscheinlich machen, als Stirnhirnschädigungen vorwiegend zu Schlaf‐Epilepsien und Parietalhirnverletzungen vorwiegend zu diffusen Epilepsien führen. Für Aufwach‐Epilepsien und für andere Lokalisationen liessen sich keine Korrelationen ermitteln. Der biologische Antagonismus zwischen Aufwach‐ und Schlaf‐Epilepsien spiegelt sich in einer unterschiedlichen Ansprechbarkeit auf Antiepileptika wieder. Schlaf‐Epilepsien sprechen gut auf Hydantoine und schlecht auf Luminal, Aufwach‐Epilepsien gut auf Luminal und nur mässig auf Hydantoine an. Für Mylepsin ergibt sich keine signifikante Wirkungsdifferenz. Bei diffusen Epilepsien ist kein Medikament optimal indiziert.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with disorganization progressive and important affecting several spheres: thought, affectivity, cognition and social life of the subject. It is a serious mental disorder with a prevalence of nearly 1%. Men would present more premorbid difficulties, but the overall prevalence of symptoms of schizophrenia is similar in both sexes. When it comes to comorbidity, men and women are vulnerable to somewhat different health issues. Anxiety symptoms are one of the main symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but the effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. About 40% have persistent anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and whether they are accompanied depressive symptoms, the symptoms may have a greater impact on the patients. We need to help patients avoid suicide when the symptoms depression appear. Hallucinations auditory, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms may exist simultaneously in patients with schizophrenia. Most studies focus on studying the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and anxiety symptoms, or the relationship between anxiety symptoms and symptoms depressive Objectives The objective of this study is to resolve important questions concerning the interaction of anxiety and schizophrenia in patients followed in psychiatry at Arrazi Hospital . Methods Descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, conducted over a period from May 2022 to October 2022 in patients consulted in Arrazi de Salé, using a questionnaire grouping together the sociodemographic characteristics, the risks and the advantages of antipsychotics, medical comorbidities and the mobilization of psychosocial support, and thus the BPRS Anxiety Rating Scale. Results Of the 42 patients who completed the study, 18 were female and 24 were male 60% were single. The average age was 36.63 years, 60% have secondary education, 25% primary, and 15% university level, 30% have a family history of schizophrenia. 32 were taking an atypical antipsychotic, 10 were taking classic neuroleptics. Most schizophrenics encountered in psychiatry are stabilized on antipsychotic treatment, and those who have an anxious comorbidity are still too often underestimated , put on the account of the positive symptoms and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, it is insufficiently diagnosed and treated. The effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. It should be kept in mind that anxiety in schizophrenia requires special attention when discussing and prescribing antipsychotic medications. Conclusions Optimal interventions for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and anxiety differ by quality of life. At all consultations, preventive strategies should consider mindful interviews and the risks and benefits of treatment for schizophrenia and comorbidities. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "ICU Pain, Anxiety, Agitation, Delirium: In Search of the Holy Grail",
      "abstract": "Pain, anxiety, agitation, and delirium occur in 15-60% of elderly hospitalized patients. The prevalence of anxiety and delirium in the mechanically ventilated ICU patients ranges from 7-80%, with the highest rates seen in those aged 65 years or older.1-4 Despite the availability of a few quickly administered bedside tests, the multifactorial causes of anxiety and delirium, many of which are preventable, are underrecognized by many caregivers (Table 1). Anxiety and delirium are associated with significant hospital morbidity and post-discharge morbidity and mortality (Figure 1). Definitions of key terms for the purposes of this article include the following:Agitation - an excessive motor activity associated with internal tension. This motor activity is usually nonpurposeful but may be irrationally purposeful and counterproductive.Anxiety - a sustained state of apprehension with accompanying autonomic arousal in response to a real or perceived threat.Delirium - an acute, potentially reversible impairment of consciousness and cognitive function that fluctuates in severity. Manifestations include apprehension, agitation, cognitive distortion, abnormal thought processes, hallucinations, and impairment of short-term memory, arousal and attention.Psychosis - active hallucination; however, in the literature, there are misnomers such as ICU psychosis, toxic confusional state, critical illness encephalopathy, and septic encephalopathy.Subsyndromal delirium - the presence of some, but not all, of the criteria for delirium.Stupor - a sustained state of spontaneous unarousability interruptible only by vigorous, direct external stimulation.Coma - a state of unarousability and unresponsiveness to all stimuli.Given the range of manifestations, the continuum/spectrum of acute brain dysfunction is shown in Figure 2.To assess the presence of delirium, one may use various bedside tools, such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU), which Ely et al.7 modified from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IIIR).8 This is shown in Figure 3.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

The emergency department (ED) management of a patient with a seizure is commonly determined by the cause, type, severity, and frequency of the seizure. Status epilepticus (SE) can be nonconvulsive or convulsive. Convulsive SE is a medical emergency requiring prompt and focused treatment. A benzodiazepine is the first class of drug to be administered in treating SE. Alcohol withdrawal seizures are generalized tonic-clonic convulsions that usually occur within 48 hours after cessation of ethanol ingestion, with a peak incidence between 13 and 24 hours. It is important that the emergency physician knows the state's law regarding restriction of driving privileges for patients who have experienced a seizure.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system. There is no (noticeable) loss of consciousness, enabling the patient's full recall (at times with suicidal attempts) (Pontius, 1981, 1984, 1987).

Massive alcohol abuse is a symptom of the main psychopath-like state limited in time by the period of an attack and disappears with the outcome of the attack.

A personality disorder is “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time and leads to distress of impairment” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Dangerous behaviors (i.e., violence or suicide attempts) are mostly found among individuals with personality disorders included in Cluster B Category: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic Personality Disorders. Individuals with Cluster B Personality Disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, and/or erratic. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which is in Cluster A, talk about violence but are usually not violent (Tardiff, 1998). The other personality disorders in Cluster A, Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders, and those in Cluster C (Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders) are not dangerous although occasionally violent or suicidal behaviors may occur if they feel angry or depressed or have an accompanying Axis I disorder, which is linked to violent or suicidal behavior. Some individuals with mental retardation are violent as a consequence of frustration and an inability to express themselves verbally.This chapter will focus on personality disorders in Cluster B and Paranoid Personality Disorder, since these are the most frequent and challenging cases where the clinician must decide whether the patient is a short-term risk for violence or suicidal behavior.",

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic.

      "title": "BELL'S MANIA",
      "abstract": "(1) There are cases of acute excitement that are classified under several headings with apparently no recognition as to the uniformity of symptomatology. These cases have been diagnosed as Bell's Mania, typhomania, acute delirious mania (manic-depressive psychosis), delirium grave, acute delirium, specific febrile delirium, and collapse delirium. (2) Luther Bell described these cases in 1849 and the description is slightly modified as follows: There is a sudden onset; exceedingly great overactivity; marked sleeplessness; great push of speech with statements that are disconnected at times by reason of the rapidity of flow; disconnected and poorly systematized delusions; transient hallucinations that border on illusions; appearance of confusion, but when one insists that the patient answer the questions, the patient can \"suspend the intellectual wanderings\" long enough to answer correctly as to orientation. The course of the illness is from three to six weeks, with a fatal termination in a large percentage of cases, apparently from cardio-vascular failure due to overactivity. The cases that recover have no after symptoms. No pathological evidence of note has been found by later workers. (3) Treatment is recommended in the form of sufficient sedative, regardless of the dosage, to enable the patient to get some rest. In our case ordinary sedatives failed and though over 125 grains of sodium amytal were given in three days the patient slept comparatively little. However, the overexcitement was quelled. (4) For the sake of clarity in the studying of this group, and until more definite findfngs are brought forth, it is suggested that these cases be called Bell's Mania, after the original observer.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter describes schizophrenia and its symptoms in more detail. Schizophrenia is a disease of the brain that affects about one percent of the population, usually occurring between adolescence and young adulthood. Its symptoms vary, but they are by nature disruptive to brain functions, and can include such issues as delusions, slow or confused thinking and movements, hallucinations, and so on. These symptoms can be classified into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive. Positive symptoms are the presence of sensations, beliefs, and behaviors that would not normally occur. Negative symptoms are characterized by a lack of important abilities, usually those dealing with motivation and socialization. Finally, cognitive symptoms refer to difficulties with concentration and memory.",

Lack of mutual consent is present in all sexual assaults. Post-traumatic symptoms occur immediately and for a large percentage of victims this trauma is not integrated for many years. Symptoms include the classic triad of post-traumatic stress symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus and lowered threshold of anxious arousal subsequent to experiencing intense fear, terror and loss of control. Long term effects include anxiety, depression, phobic reactions to situations reminiscent of the sexual assault, sexual dysfunction, impaired social adjustment and diminished capacity to enjoy life.

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome consists in the association of an aphasia acquired during childhood or adolescence after a period of normal development, accompanied by epileptic fits and, sometimes, psychological disturbances. The appearance of the symptoms may not be simultaneous. The nature of this syndrome has been widely discussed and even the possibility of being a non-unitary syndrome has been considered. It may be possibly due to diverse etiologies, genetic or acquired (infectious). The relation between the aphasic, the psychologic and the convulsive symptoms has also raised controversies. A case of a female is described in which the psychological symptomatology was so severe, she had to be admitted in a psychiatric unit. The symptoms consisted in agitation during the night and severe persistent insomnia so as difficulties for relationship during day. No abnormalities were detected in a TAC nor in a RM but electroencephalographic and neuropsychological abnormalities were detected. The epileptic fits disappeared with a carbamacepine treatment but the rest of symptoms remained even more accentuated. After her admission, a treatment with valproate achieved to control her fits and the aphasic symptoms and neuropsychological deficits were compensated in the course of several months. After a year of treatment the patient's life was normalized, she resumed her studies, the EEG abnormalities disappeared so as the psychological disturbances and the behavior problems with the exception of phobic symptoms, similar to the ones of other family members. The patient has a history of epilepsy on its mother's side. The evolution and treatment response suggests that at least in some cases of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, the etiology of the aphasia and other neuropsychological deficits and of the behavior disorders are related with some subclinical epileptic discharges and with a \"functional inhibition\" of some areas of the nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Cotard syndrome (CS) is a rare neuropsychiatric condition characterized by nihilistic delusions, which may range from negation of existence of parts of the body to delusion of being dead or negation of self-existence, and it requires an urgent and appropriate therapy. Objectives Our objective is to highlight the importance of CS, reinforcing that medical professionals should be aware of this pathology to prompt clinical description, diagnostic and treatment. Aims The aim of this presentation is to alert psychiatrists to this remaining syndrome. Methods Review of phenomenological and theoretical issues regarding SC. Results CS can be found in numerous psychiatric or neurologic pathologies but it is most seen in patients with severe depression. It is typically divided in three subtypes: psychotic depression, Cotard type I, with nihilistic delusions without mood symptoms, and Cotard type II, with mood symptoms and auditory hallucinations. There are numerous etiological hypothesis mechanisms, including unusual perceptual experiences, which can similarly be involved in Capgras delusion, disconnection from emotional or limbic processes, an impaired belief evaluation or a tendency to excessive self-attribution. Frontotemporoparietal circuitry also seems to have an important role in its pathology. Treatment usually involves electroconvulsive therapy, antidepressants and anti-psychotics and the prognosis depends on the underlying disorders. Conclusions CS is a rare pathology with self-defeating risk and its clinical recognition and proper treatment are essential to improve the prognosis of these patients. Diagnostic criteria or clinical instruments for assessment of this syndrome should be encouraged, since its lack is a limitation for systematic studies and consequent management advances.

Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next.

Although their form of clinical presentation may be similar, their evolution and prognosis are very different. It is very important to detect the possible factors of chronicity in order to make an early intervention and thus to diminish the negative consequences of the disease.We conducted a 2 year prospective study in 48 patients diagnosed with acute psychosis in their first admission. Data was collected on the evolution and follow-up of the patient in the Mental Health Unit and the sociodemographic and clinical factors of the psychotic index episode that could predict a change in the diagnosis during the two years follow-up were analyzed.None of the sociodemographic or clinical variables studied could predict a change in the diagnosis, except for the presence of a control delusion during the index episode. The diagnosis of schizophreniform or not otherwise specified psychotic disorders predicts an evolution towards schizophrenia or affective psychosis while a brief or substance-induced psychotic episode has a better prognosis, with a tendency to maintain the same diagnosis in the 2 years of follow-up.After 2 years of follow-up, an significant number of the patients initially diagnosed of acute psychosis evolved towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia or affective psychosis in a difficult-to-predict way.",

The patients are distracted, inattentive, tired, dull, do not take pleasure in work, their mind wanders, they lose the connection, they ‘cannot keep the thought in mind‘…” ( Kraepelin, 1898 ) Cognitive dysfunction has long been recognised as a cardinal feature of schizophrenia, dating back to Kraepelin's description of dementia praecox (1919). Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is seen early in the illness and is initially mild, increasing in severity in some chronic patients. It is recognised as a primary and pervasive deficit that is independent of positive symptoms in that it persists after resolution of acute symptoms. It is not restricted to a subgroup and is seen to a greater or lesser extent in almost all patients suffering from schizophrenia (Goldberg et al, 1990).",

      "abstract": "Seasonal affective disorder is a mood disorder that is a subtype or qualifier of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is characterized by depressive symptoms that occur at a specific time of year (typically fall or winter) with full remission at other times of year (typically spring or summer). Possible risk factors include family history, female sex, living at a more northern latitude, and young adulthood (18 to 30 years of age). With the temporal nature of the mood episodes, diagnosis requires full remission when the specified season ends and two consecutive years of episodes in the same season. First-line therapy for seasonal affective disorder includes light therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. Commercial devices are available for administering light therapy or dawn simulation. The light intensity and duration of treatment depend on the device and the patient's initial response, but 2,500 to 10,000 lux for 30 to 60 minutes at the same time every day is typically effective. Lifestyle interventions, such as increasing exercise and exposure to natural light, are also recommended. If seasonal affective disorder recurs, long-term treatment or preventive intervention is typically indicated, and bupropion appears to have the strongest evidence supporting long-term use. Continuing light therapy or other antidepressants is likely beneficial, although evidence is inconclusive. Evidence is also inconclusive for psychotherapy and vitamin D supplementation.",

Daher werden Betroffene nicht nur wegen akuter Anfälle, sondern häufig auch im Kontext von Operationen oder anderen Erkrankungen intensivmedizinisch behandelt. Fieberkrämpfe treten bei 3 % im Kleinkindalter auf und haben eine gute Prognose. Ein febriler Status epilepticus ist ein Notfall. Akute symptomatische Anfälle erfordern ebenfalls keine Dauertherapie, jedoch eine Behandlung der Ursache. Bei Frühanfällen nach Schädel-Hirn-Trauma ist eine kurzfristige antiepileptische Therapie indiziert. Der Status epilepticus ist der häufigste neuropädiatrische Notfall und erfordert ein rasches und konsequentes therapeutisches Handeln. Nach Ausschluss akut behandlungsbedürftiger symptomatischer Ursachen hat die Therapie klar Vorrang vor der weitergehenden Diagnostik. Benzodiazepine sind zur Anfallsunterbrechung Mittel der ersten Wahl. Nach 2 erfolglosen Applikationen wird eine andere Substanzgruppe (Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, andere) gewählt. Nach Versagen dieses zweiten Schritts ist in der Regel eine Intubationsnarkose indiziert. Eine antiepileptische Dauertherapie sollte man während der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung möglichst unverändert fortführen. Einige Medikamente können intravenös verabreicht werden. Bei anderen überbrückt man Nüchternzeiten mit intermittierenden Benzodiazepingaben. Viele Antiepileptika haben ein hohes Wechselwirkungspotenzial, das man unbedingt beachten muss.",

They showed electroencephalographically SWC patterns either in clinical or subclinical ways.2) The type of the occurrence of the SWC in the waking state was divided into the following 3 types.Type I: Its occurrence closely related with the patient's arousal level, and was influenced by external circumstances. In other words, the SWC appearred to be occurred in the relaxation or the state of sleepy tendency of the patient, and its occurrence was often interrupted by the stimuli from the outside.Type II: The SWC patterns occurred rhythmically at a certain intervals, and sometimes concentrated at a certain time of the day. In this type, the occurrence was seemed to be ocrrelated with the daily rhythms of the living body.Type III: No characteristics were seemed in the occurrence of the SWC patterns, in addition its frequency was very high and irregular.Type I mainly correlated with petit mal epilepsy, Type II mainly grand malepilepsy, and Type III patients in whom were seemed the sign of severe organic lesions of the brain.Type II patients had 1-2 peaks of the SWC's occurrence in the morning (within 2-3 hours after awake) or in the evening.And so metimes immediately after this peak, clinical grand mal seizures were observed.3) During the sleep the SWC patterns transformed itself, as reported on petit mal epilepsies by many investigators.The SWC patterns which showed regular rhythmicity in the waking state brake out its regular rhythmicity and shortened its duration and, moreover, its slow component dissapeared and showed only spike components according to the depth of sleep.In a whole night this cyclic change of the SWC patterns was repeated.In the stage of activated sleep the SWC patterns dissapeared, or showed the regular rhythmicity and duration as seen in the day time.Comparing the frequency of the SWC's occurrence during the sleep and the day time, the former was more frequent than the latter.Thus, petit mal and grand mal epilepsy which showed different occurrence of the SWC patterns each other in the waking state showed only this occurrence during the sleeping state4) In 5 cases re-recording were done after 6-21 months.The type of the occurrence of the SWC patterns i n the day time showed no changes if the type of the clinical seizure did not changeThis fact emphasized the correlation between the type of the SWC's occurrence in the day time and the type of clinical seizures5) From the findings mentioned above the neurophysiolosical mechanism related to the centrencephalic seizures was discussed.",

      "abstract": "The long-term prognosis for epileptics vary from an entirely normal life to early death or complete incapacity. Studies to date have not provided clear answers on the long-term sequelae of epilepsy. This is because there are many epileptic syndromes with different outcomes. Most studies include a heterogeneous group of patients who may not be representative of all the epileptics in the community. The prognosis for permanent remission of seizure varies with the seizure type. In childhood epilepsies, overall there is at least 50% chance of permanent remission. The more seizures the patient has had before anticonvulsants were started, the more difficult it is to control the seizures, the poorer the prospects for remission. Other unfavourable signs include partial seizures, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, neurological deficits and underlying brain lesion. The effect of seizures on intellectual development is controversial. Actual regression in children with epilepsy is rare except where the seizures are caused by a progressive pathology. However, in a significant proportion of children, intellectual development slows down after the onset of seizures. This is more likely to occur in children with severe seizures, and those on multiple anticonvulsants and with frequent toxic levels. Children with epilepsy have an increased likelihood of developing behavioural, emotional and psychiatric problems. The underlying neurological dysfunction, anxiety about losing control of oneself at any time, reaction of parents, friends and teachers to the condition and side effects of anticonvulsants all contribute to the psychopathology. In conclusion, the long-term sequelae of epilepsy are multiple and serious. Some of the causal factors are known and preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It was established that taking into account special working conditions, the personnel of the State Criminal-Executive Service of Ukraine&nbsp;&nbsp;is under the permanent influence of various stress factors, experiences negative emotions and is often in destructive psychological states, which can lead to the development of manifestations of addictive behavior. It was determined that the formation of the addictive behavior covers two stages – experiencing of an acute change in the mental state at the emotional level and the formation of a certain sequence of appeals to the means of addiction, which is common for different forms of such behavior. It has been found that among the representatives of bodies and institutions of execution of punishments the most common are socially acceptable or neutral or comparatively dangerous types of addictive behavior, in particular computer or Internet addiction, workaholism, etc. Among the more socially dangerous forms of addictive behavior, chemical addictions (the use of alcohol and other psychoactive substances – cannabinoids, opiates, psychostimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), hallucinogens of natural and synthetic origin, as well as the abuse of hypnotic-sedative drugs) and non-chemical addictions (addictions), which at this time, according to researchers, there are currently more than two hundred forms (pathological tendency to gambling; ludomania – sweepstakes, lotteries, slot machines, casinos, less often – card games) are common.

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Prolonged loss of consciousness (coma, defined as a Glasgow Coma Score of 8 or less) is seen commonly: (1) following head injury, (2) after an overdose of sedating drugs, and (3) in the situation of ‘non-traumatic coma’, where there are many possible diagnoses, but the most common are postanoxic, postischaemic, systemic infection, and metabolic derangement (e.g. hypoglycaemia). Urgent assessment is required to identify and, where possible, correct the pathological cause, and protect the brain from the development of irreversible damage. Specific treatment (if any) will depend upon the particular cause of coma, but—whatever the cause—long-term attention is required to the patient’s respiration, skin, circulation, and bladder and bowel function, seizures must be controlled, and the level of consciousness should be regularly assessed and monitored.",

      "title": "Identificación de marcadores en esquizofrenia y su tratamiento mediante proteómica comparativa en cerebro humano postmortem",
      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un sindrome complejo que se caracteriza por un trastorno notable del funcionamiento social y una desorganizacion grave de la personalidad. Se trata de una enfermedad cronica que suele manifestarse en los inicios de la adolescencia en varones e inicios de la juventud en mujeres. El curso de la enfermedad comienza con una serie de sintomas inespecificos que constituyen la fase prodromica y que presenta una duracion variable, seguida de episodios en los que se alternan los llamados sintomas positivos y negativos. La hipotesis clasica de la enfermedad se basa en una sobreactivacion del sistema dopaminergico. No obstante, estudios posteriores han implicado a otros sistemas neuroquimicos como el glutamatergico o el gabaergico. Recientemente, han surgido nuevas hipotesis distintas a las neuroquimicas y que se relacionan con alteraciones vinculadas al neurodesarrollo. Los farmacos empleados para el tratamiento de la enfermedad son los antipsicoticos. Estos farmacos son de dos tipos: 1) antipsicoticos tipicos: actuan sobre los receptores del sistema dopaminergico y presentan numerosos efectos secundarios. 2) antipsicoticos atipicos: farmacos de nueva generacion que presentan un perfil farmacologico mas amplio y menos efectos secundarios. A pesar del desarrollo de la segunda de generacion de farmacos, el tratamiento de la enfermedad no es del todo efectivo y muchos pacientes son resistentes a la medicacion. Por ello, es interesante la busqueda de nuevos mecanismos que esten alterados en la enfermedad y que pudieran ser empleados como dianas terapeuticas para el desarrollo de nuevos tratamientos futuros. Durante los ultimos anos han surgido las denominadas tecnologias -omicas que permiten el estudio a gran escala de los productos del genoma, ya sea a nivel de mRNA (Genomica) o de proteinas (Proteomica). La Proteomica se centra en el estudio de la totalidad de las proteinas expresadas en un determinado tejido y momento del desarrollo englobando una gran variedad de tecnicas entre las que se encuentra la electroforesis bidimensional. Esta tecnica consiste en una separacion de las proteinas en primer lugar por punto isoeletrico en un gradiente de pH, seguido de una separacion por peso molecular. A continuacion, las proteinas se visualizan mediante un metodo de tincion. El resultado es un mapa de proteinas o proteoma en el que cada punto representa una proteina. En este proyecto de tesis doctoral se ha realizado un estudio comparativo de los proteomas de corteza prefrontal de cerebro humano postmortem procedentes de individuos esquizofrenicos fallecidos por suicidio y de controles fallecidos por causas accidentales y sin ningun antecedente de enfermedades psiquiatricas. Las muestras con las que se trabajo proceden del banco de cerebros del grupo de Neuropsicofarmacologia del Departamento de Farmacologia de la UPV/EHU, y se obtuvieron en el transcurso de las autopsias judiciales realizadas en el Instituto Vasco de Medicina Legal, a traves de un acuerdo establecido entre ambas instituciones.",

      "title": "Sleep and Biological Clocks",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

If duration of tics is less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least 1 year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

En consecuencia comienza con aumento de clínica ansiosa hasta terminar en episodio de corte psicótico que requiere de internamiento involuntario en unidad de hospitalización iniciando tratamiento con Olanzapina 10 mg /24h con adecuada respuesta y resolución de la clínica a los pocos días del ingreso, procediéndose al alta hospitalaria.

The labile (mild, episodic) forms of AH aggravated by cerebrovascular pathology (MBS) are likely to be the constituent part of the psychovegetative syndrome (the first psychovegetative personality type). The stable forms of AH (including malignant ones) aggravated by episodes of vascular dyscirculatory disorders (MBS) are similar to the second psychovegetative personality type as regards their characterological and vegetative traits.

      "abstract": "La Epilepsia es una enfermedad que se caracteriza por una actividad cerebral anómala, que se manifiesta como una predisposición a largo plazo a generar crisis epilépticas, comportamientos inusuales y, en ocasiones, pérdida de la conciencia. Existen más de 70 millones de personas en el mundo con epilepsia, concentrándose la mayor proporción en países en vías de desarrollo. En Argentina, particularmente, se estima que 1 de cada 100 personas padece esta enfermedad. La principal estrategia para abordar su tratamiento es el uso de fármacos anticonvulsivos (FACs), y la selección de la farmacoterapia óptima se basa en la clasificación adecuada de las crisis experimentadas por cada paciente. Sin embargo, alrededor del 30% de los enfermos sufren crisis persistentes incluso con el uso de farmacoterapias adecuadas, fenómeno conocido como Farmacorresistencia o Epilepsia Farmacorresistente. Los individuos farmacorresistentes experimentan un aumento de riesgo de muerte, y pueden desarrollar trastornos de índole psiquiátrica, cognitiva o de comportamiento. La problemática resumida previamente justifica la constante búsqueda de nuevos FACs con mayor eficacia y menor toxicidad. Cabe destacar que aun en farmacoterapias que logran controlar las crisis, los compuestos administrados no están libres de efectos adversos. En algunos casos, los pacientes experimentan efectos secundarios que van desde somnolencia e irritabilidad hasta otros más graves como depresión, deterioro de las capacidades cognitivas y hepatotoxicidad. El presente trabajo de tesis doctoral tiene como objetivo general la síntesis y evaluación biológica de nuevos FACs más eficaces y mejor tolerados, mediante el uso de estrategias racionales para el diseño de fármacos multiobjetivo. La epilepsia es una enfermedad multifactorial, heterogénea y compleja. Al igual que en otras enfermedades relacionadas con el sistema nervioso central (SNC), el desafío es lograr la modulación simultánea de un número específico de blancos moleculares (targets) sin alterar la actividad cerebral normal. En esta tesis se propone como hipótesis de trabajo que es posible encontrar fármacos anticonvulsivos con mayor eficacia y menor toxicidad, mediante el empleo de estrategias racionales para la generación de compuestos multiobjetivo, que contemplen la información disponible respecto a los mecanismos de acción de los FACs, la fisiología neuronal y la generación de las crisis. Por lo tanto, se plantean los siguientes objetivos específicos: 1) Síntesis orgánica de nuevas moléculas multiobjetivo. Se obtendrán nuevos compuestos multiobjetivo mediante la unión química del ácido valproico con compuestos seleccionados de diversa actividad biológica relacionada con la patología de estudio (bloqueantes de canales de sodio voltaje operados, inhibidores de la recaptación de ácido у-aminobutírico y antiinflamatorios). 2) Síntesis de derivados de parabenos. Se prepararán las amidas derivadas de parabenos (por considerarse bioisósteros de esta familia de compuestos) para su posterior evaluación in vitro. Aquellos compuestos activos podrán ser utilizados como nuevos grupos moduladores para la síntesis de drogas multiobjetivo con ácido valproico. 3) Evaluación biológica in vivo de los candidatos sintetizados. Se testeará la capacidad anticonvulsiva de los compuestos sintetizados en modelos animales de fase preclínica.",

Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of PPS and the majority of patients identify fatigue as their most troubling symptom. The aetiology of the symptom arouses great interest, mainly due to its multifactorial character, and can be divided into two components: peripheral (muscular) fatigue and central (general) or simultaneously-occurring fatigue. Considering the importance of the symptom and the limitations that can cause in PPS patients, it is important to consider a series of variables, so that it can be better understood, thus providing a more effective and specific treatment.",

      "title": "Safety, Efficacy, and Patient Acceptability of Aripiprazole in the Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background Bipolar disorder (manic depression) is a serious, long-term mental illness that affects about 1% of adults at some time during their life. It usually develops in late adolescence or early adulthood and affects men and women from all backgrounds. People with bipolar disorder experience wild mood swings that interfere with daily life and damage relationships. They can also have psychotic symptoms: they may see or hear things that are not there. During depressive episodes, affected individuals may feel helpless, worthless, and suicidal. Treatments for bipolar disorder include drugs to stabilize mood swings (for example, lithium and anticonvulsant medications), antide-pressants to treat depressive episodes and antipsychotic drugs to treat manic episodes. The development of second-generation atypical antipsychotics (SGAs) has increased the hopes of psychiatrists. SGAs, however, cannot be considered a unique pharmacological class since each SGA has many complex pharmacologic actions, only some of which are shared with other SGAs. Even though, many antipsychotics have similar efficacy on average, prescribers may be able to achieve better than average results by considering differences in selecting a specific drug for a specific patient. Clinicians know that each patient is unique and in order to achieve best outcomes for the individual patient, the better therapy is the therapy tailored for the single patient. Objectives With this article we provide information on a relatively new antipsychotic aripiprazole released in 2002 by Bristol-Myers Squibb for the treatment of schizophrenia; for acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in 2004; as an adjunct for major depressive disorder on November 2007; and to treat irritability in children with autism on 2009. Compared with other first line atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole has a unique profile due to partial agonism at dopamine D2 and D3 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors. This paper describes the development of aripiprazole, its unique properties and its metabolically-friendly profile including its receptor binding affinities, pharmacokinetics, central nervous system activity results of clinical efficacy and relevant clinical trials, in particular safety, efficacy and patient acceptability are also examined. The available literature on aripiprazole of the last six years is reviewed.",

      "title": "Epileptic Encephalopathies: A Brief Overview",
      "abstract": "Summary Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which neurologic deterioration is attributable entirely or partly to epileptic activity. It can be due to very frequent or severe seizures and/or to subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity. The former mainly consists of Dravet syndrome, in which patients have seizures from the middle of the first year of life and repeat episodes of severe febrile status epilepticus and migrating partial epilepsy in infancy, in which from the first trimester of life, partial seizures affect various areas of the cortex randomly and in a subcontinuous fashion. In Rasmussen syndrome, also, epileptic activity contributes at least partly to the neurologic deterioration. Subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity affects newborn infants with suppression bursts, thus consisting in either Ohtahara syndrome or neonatal myoclonic encephalopathy. In infants, it is either myoclonic epilepsy of nonprogressive encephalopathy or West syndrome. In school-age children, it consists of various types of generalized seizures combined with slow spike waves of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and continuous spike waves in slow sleep combined with various motor or cognitive deficits including negative myoclonus, orofacial dyspraxia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and frontal lobe syndrome. Treatment differs for all of these syndromes. It is important to avoid potential drug-induced worsening, and valproate is preferred when a definitive diagnosis is not reached in children and especially infants.",

      "title": "La démence associée à la sclérose hippocampique : une nouvelle variété de démence frontotemporale ?",
      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Florence Mahieux La sclerose hippocampique (SH) designe une perte de neurones au niveau de l’hippocampe, accompagnee d’une proliferation de cellules gliales. Une SH est frequemment observee lors d’interventions chirurgicales pour epilepsie temporale, mais aussi apres traumatisme crânien, hypoglycemie severe ou arret cardiaque prolonge. Sa presence lors de l’examen neuropathologique de malades dements est signalee depuis de nombreuses annees, au cours de diverses maladies (maladie d’Alzheimer, demence avec corps de Lewy, ou demences dites « sans signe histopathologique distinct ») et, beaucoup plus rarement, de facon isolee (SH « pure ») [1]. Sa frequence varie, selon les series, de 0,4 % a 8 %. La notion de SH « pure » est sujette a discussion en temps qu’entite specifique et n’est pas definie par tous de la meme facon (essentiellement selon le degre de « purete » de l’atteinte). Les tableaux cliniques (succinctement) decrits peuvent etre similaires a ceux d’une maladie d’Alzheimer comme d’une demence frontotemporale. L’origine hypoxique (vasculaire) ou non de cette lesion est egalement l’objet de constatations contradictoires. Deux articles recents offrent une nouvelle piste a notre reflexion, explorant successivement, selon l’angle neurologique et neuropathologique, une serie de 19 cas de SH « pure », issus de la banque de cerveaux de l’hopital John Hopkins de Baltimore, constituee entre 1985 et 2002 [2, 3]. Il faut cependant noter que les dossiers cliniques prealables pouvaient provenir d’unites hospitalieres differentes et ont ete recueillies retrospectivement. Ces cas ont ete compares, pour les donnees cliniques, a 24 cas de demence frontotemporale (DFT) anatomiquement definie, incluant les differentes variantes connues de ce syndrome et 19 cas de maladie d’Alzheimer (MA), apparies pour l’âge, le sexe et l’âge de debut des symptomes. Globalement, la frequence et le spectre des troubles comportementaux des SH etaient similaires a ceux du groupe des DFT (plus grande frequence de l’incurie et des comportements stereotypes, alors que l’apathie, les hallucinations et l’agressivite etaient plus frequents dans la MA). Les troubles neuropsychologiques differenciaient egalement les groupes : la desorientation, les troubles du calcul et l’agnosie etant plus particulierement le fait de la MA. L’apraxie etait significativement plus rare dans la SH, mais le mutisme y etait nettement plus frequent que pour les deux autres groupes. Les troubles de memoire etaient particulierement mal decrits (probablement du fait de la provenance tres diverse des cas), ce qui represente tres clairement une des faiblesses de l’etude. L’analyse en aveugle des dossiers cliniques par un groupe de cliniciens a montre que 57 % des cas de SH etaient compatibles avec un diagnostic de DFT (repartis pour moitie en DFT pure probable et DFT / possible MA). Dans les groupes controles choisis, la sensibilite des criteres cliniques etait de 64 % et la specificite de 74 % ; 1/19 patients MA etant classe comme DFT pure probable et 5 patients du groupe des DFT etant classes comme MA probable et/ou possible.  Le deuxieme article correspondait a une analyse neuropathologique plus poussee de 18 des 19 cas de SH. Chez 11 d’entre eux ont ete retrouvees des inclusions neuronales ubiquitine-positive, generalement considerees comme caracteristiques des demences associees aux atteintes du motoneurone (en rappelant que tous les intermediaires possibles entre SLA cliniquement pure et demence sans atteinte clinique motrice ont ete decrits avec ce type de lesions [4]). La comparaison des patients ayant ces inclusions avec ceux qui en etaient depourvus n’a pas permis de mettre en evidence la moindre specificite clinique. La mesure de la proteine tau, aussi bien sous sa forme soluble (diminuee dans un certain nombre de cas de demence « sans caractere histopathologique distinct ») que sous sa forme insoluble (elevee dans la MA), n’a mis en evidence aucune difference avec les controles.  L’ensemble de ces deux articles suggere que les SH « pures » pourraient s’agglutiner au groupe grandissant des DFT, malgre l’absence de toute anomalie de la proteine tau (elles n’appartiendraient donc pas au cadre des tauopathies). Un certain nombre d’entre elles pourraient relever de la meme etiologie que les demences « associees aux atteintes du motoneurone », sans que ce sous-groupe puisse etre mieux defini. L’origine des troubles cliniques de type frontal n’est par ailleurs pas expliquee, meme si les auteurs avancent l’hypothese d’une deafferentation du cortex orbitofrontal liee a l’atteinte des projections de l’hippocampe.  Ces etudes soulignent par ailleurs la grande difficulte du diagnostic etiologique des demences sur les seules donnees cliniques, un meme syndrome pouvant relever de pathologies tres differentes ayant une meme repartition spatiale. 1.

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "title": "Disautonomia: Uma Condição Esquecida – Parte 1",
      "abstract": "Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm if <20 years) or HR ≥120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.O termo disautonomia abrange um conjunto de condições clínicas com características e prognósticos distintos. Classificam-se em síndromes reflexas, síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), síndrome da fadiga crônica, Hipotensão Ortostática Neurogênica (HON) e a Síndrome da hipersensibilidade do seio carotídeo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) não serão discutidas neste artigo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) são, na maioria das vezes, benignas, e ocorrem usualmente em pacientes sem doença intrínseca do sistema nervoso autônomo (SNA) ou do coração. Por isso, geralmente são estudadas separadamente. O termo neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) é o mais utilizado na atualidade para definir as disautonomias com comprometimento do sistema nervoso autônomo cardiovascular simpático e/ou parassimpático. Pode ser idiopática, como a atrofia multissistêmica ou a falência autonômica pura, ou secundária a patologias sistêmicas como diabetes mellitus, doenças neurodegenerativas, doença de Parkinson, síndromes demenciais, insuficiência renal crônica, amiloidose, podendo também acometer idosos. A presença de neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) implica em maior gravidade e pior prognóstico em diversas situações clínicas. A detecção de hipotensão ortostática (HO) é um sinal tardio e significa maior gravidade no contexto das disautonomias, definida como hipotensão ortostática neurogênica (HON). Deve ser diferenciada das hipotensões por hipovolemia ou medicamentosas, chamadas de hipotensão ortostática não neurogênica (HONN). A HO pode decorrer de causas benignas, como a hipovolemia aguda, crônica, ou ao uso de diversos fármacos. Esses fármacos podem, entretanto, apenas desmascarar quadros subclínicos de disautonomia. Deve-se reavaliar todos os fármacos de pacientes com quadros disautonômicos. O diagnóstico preciso de NAC e a investigação do envolvimento de outros órgãos ou sistemas é de extrema importância na suspeita clínica de uma pandisautonomia. No diabético, além da idade e do tempo de doença, outros fatores estão associados a maior ocorrência de NAC, como descontrole glicêmico, hipertensão, dislipidemia e obesidade. Entre os pacientes diabéticos, 38–44% podem evoluir com disautonomia, com implicações prognósticas e maior mortalidade cardiovascular. Nas etapas iniciais da DM, a disfunção autonômica envolve o sistema parassimpático, posteriormente o simpático e mais tardiamente manifesta-se com hipotensão ortostática. Os testes de Valsalva, respiratório e ortostático (30:15) são os métodos de padrão ouro para o diagnóstico de NAC. Eles podem ser associados aos testes de variabilidade RR no domínio do tempo, e principalmente da frequência, para aumento da sensibilidade (protocolo dos 7 testes). Esses testes podem detectar alterações iniciais ou subclínicas e avaliar a gravidade e o prognóstico. O teste de inclinação (tilt test) não deve ser o exame de escolha para investigação de NAC em fase inicial, pois detecta casos em fases mais avançadas. A resposta no tilt com padrão disautonômico (queda gradativa da pressão arterial sem aumento da frequência cardíaca) pode sugerir NAC. O tratamento dos pacientes em fases moderadas a avançadas das disautonomias é bastante complexo e muitas vezes refratário, necessitando de avaliação especializada e multidisciplinar. Não há cura para a maioria das disautonomias em fase tardia. Os pacientes com HON podem evoluir com hipertensão supina em mais de 50% dos casos, representando um grande desafio terapêutico. O risco imediato e as consequências da HO devem ter preferência sobre os riscos mais tardios da hipertensão supina e valores maiores que 160/90 mmHg são toleráveis. Medidas como dormir com a cabeceira elevada (20–30 cm), não levantar à noite, uso de anti-hipertensivo de ação curta noturna para casos mais severos, como a losartana, captopril, clonidina ou adesivos de nitratos, podem ser necessários e efetivos em alguns casos. As medidas preventivas como cuidados posturais, boa hidratação, maior ingesta de sal, uso de meias e cintas abdominais compressoras, refeições fracionadas, atividade física supervisionada principalmente sentada, deitada ou exercícios na água são etapas importantes no tratamento. Diversos fármacos podem ser usados para HON sintomática, principalmente a fludrocortisona, a midodrina e a droxidopa. Esses últimas não estão disponíveis no Brasil. O risco de exacerbação ou desencadeamento de hipertensão supina deve ser considerado. A síndrome da fadiga crônica representa uma forma de disautonomia e tem sido renomeada como doença sistêmica de intolerância ao exercício, com novos critérios diagnósticos: 1 - Fadiga inexplicada, levando a incapacidade para o trabalho por mais que 6 meses; 2 - Mal-estar após exercício; 3 - Sono não reparador; 4 - Mais um dos seguintes achados: comprometimento cognitivo ou intolerância ortostática. Várias patologias na atualidade têm evoluído com fadiga crônica, sendo denominadas de doenças crônicas associadas a fadiga crônica. A síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), outra forma de apresentação das síndromes disautonômicas, é caracterizada por elevação sustentada da frequência cardíaca (FC) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm se <20 anos) ou FC ≥120 bpm, nos primeiros 10 minutos em posição ortostática ou durante o tilt test, sem hipotensão ortostática clássica associada. Pode ocorrer leve redução na pressão arterial. Os sintomas manifestam-se ou pioram em posição ortostática, sendo comuns a tontura, fraqueza, pré-síncope, palpitações, além de outros sintomas sistêmicos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Panic disorder refers to recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about their recurrence and their consequences or a significant maladaptive change in behavior consequent to the attacks. Highly comorbid with panic disorder, agoraphobia refers to marked fear or avoidance of specific situations from which escape is perceived to be difficult or in which help may be unavailable in the event of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. This chapter focuses on the assessment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in adults. It begins with a review of the nature of the disorders, which is followed by a review of clinical assessment instruments designed for the assessment purposes of (a) diagnosis, (b) case conceptualization and treatment planning, and (c) treatment monitoring and evaluation. Recommendations are included for instruments with the greatest scientific support and for assessing these anxiety disorders in a clinically sensitive manner.",

The interviewer should inquire whether the child experiences repeated, severe anger or temper outbursts that are either verbal (verbal rages) or involve physical aggression towards other people or things and for no good reason. The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

Depression is a particularly common and worrisome comorbidity, especially because suicidality seems to be increased significantly in the context of epilepsy. Although psychosocial stressors commonly are associated, intrinsic characteristics of seizure disorders may contribute to the expression of depressive symptoms. Depression and epilepsy may exacerbate each other. Epilepsy with seizure foci in the temporal lobe may represent a higher risk of developing depression, especially if the seizures do not generalize. Treatment of depression is multifaceted and includes psychotherapy and sophisticated regimens of anticonvulsants. Most antidepressants may be used safely and effectively in the context of depression, although high-quality evidence is lacking. Ultimately, treatment of comorbid mood disorder has important implications for outcome and quality of life, perhaps even more than treatment of epilepsy itself.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

Partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night and phase-advance of the sleep-wake cycle induce temporary clinical remission: these experiments indicate that abnormally advanced rhythms are not merely an epiphenomenon but play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. They lead to the hypothesis that depression occurs in susceptible individuals when a sleep-sensitive phase of the circadian system becomes advanced from the first hours of waking into the last hours of sleep and interacts with sleep to cause depression.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tics that start in childhood, persist for at least 1 year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications/drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

      "title": "Organic mood disorder: Sequelae of small vessel disease",
      "abstract": "Sir, Bipolar disorder predominantly begins in young adults, with evidence of bimodal presentation with a second peak in late life, i.e., beyond 50 years, wherein diagnosis is difficult.[1] Cerebrovascular lesions, ischemic variety, may be one of the etiological causes for such neuropsychiatric complication, and small vessel involvement may not present with typical stroke syndrome. 2 We present here a mood disorder, manic type secondary to small vessel disease. A 64-year-old female was brought with complaints of memory disturbances and irritable behavior for 1 year. Onset was noted with giddiness and one episode with fall associated with loss of consciousness. She was managed conservatively for this. During the last 1 month, she developed agitation in the form of singing and dancing, at times noticed to be muttering to self with inadequate sleep. She would claim that she is as good as “Lata Mangeshkar” in singing. Hence, she was referred to our unit. Other symptoms were overtalkativeness, jocularity, and irritable mood. She would make inappropriate comments (about her increased sexual urges) in front of relatives and accuse the husband of infidelity. Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. No history of psychiatric illness in the patient (prior to this episode) or her first-degree family relatives was elicited. No history of convulsions/seizures was elicited. On mental status examination, she had increased psychomotor activity, appeared overfamiliar, and overdressed. She was distractible with pressure of speech. She had delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity claiming to have superpowers and having the most melodious voice in all over India. She also claimed God, and various actors were speaking to her directly, inferred as auditory hallucinations. Her mood was elated and irritable, but her affect was stable. Her judgment was impaired. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Neurological evaluation was normal. Clinical testing for the frontal lobe showed impaired alternate hand sequence and a lack of concern, suggesting dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal area dysfunction. She performed well on clinical parietal lobe testing. Her mini-mental status score was 16 out of 30. Since the patient was inattentive, these findings are to be interpreted with caution. Neuropsychological evaluation and neurological intervention could not be done due to the patient's uncooperativeness. Computerized tomography of the brain showed scattered ischemic foci in the bilateral frontal periventricular and left posterior parietal subcortical white matter and bilateral posterior capsule-ganglionic white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain also showed multiple small ischemic foci scattered in the bilateral subcortical and periventricular deep white matter in the frontoparietal regions and associated mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. She was started on tablet sodium valproate 200 mg BD in view of irritability and impulsivity. Tablet aripiprazole 2.5 mg per day was added in view of mood-congruent psychotic symptoms, behavioral problems, and safer cardiac profile.[3] On increasing to 5 mg over a week, improvement of almost 50% was reported with decreased irritability although the delusion of infidelity and delusion of grandiosity persisted but with lesser intensity. The patient tolerated valproate well, and levels were not estimated. Cerebral small vascular disease, of the gray and white matter, is a group of pathological process with myriad etiology.[4] Classical strokes such as hemiplegia may not be seen in lacunar and white matter lesions.[56] Although responsible for ischemic strokes in 25% of cases, the manifestations vary, such as the disorders of sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance, and coordination depending on the location of the lesion.[78] We diagnosed her as an organic mood disorder secondary to the small vessel disease. This was considered due to the temporal relationship of the disinhibition, talkativeness, grandiosity with long-standing history of hypertension, history of falls as probable presentation of the lacunar infarcts, absence of past or family history of mood disorder, consistent features of behavioral change due injury to the frontal lobe and impaired functioning on clinical testing, and radiological findings justifying the deficits. Late-onset mood disorder in the elderly is less reported and devoid of guidelines for its management.[9] A small vessel disease with such a presentation may be missed, as it may be devoid of a classical stroke-like presentation with neurological deficits. Further volume of data is necessary for understanding the relationship between such vascular lesions, consequential loss of function, and the ensuing presentations of mood episodes in the elderly. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form, the patient has given her consent for her images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patient understands that name and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Kvaliteta života osoba s bipolarnim afektivnim poremećajem",
      "abstract": "Bipolarni afektivni poremecaj je psihicka bolest koja spada u kategoriju poremecaja raspoloženja. Manija i depresija su suprotni polovi ovog poremecaja. Ova bolest je karakteristicna izmjenjivim fazama sniženog raspoloženja (depresija) i povisenog raspoloženja (manija). S obzirom da je tijek bolesti izrazito promjenjiv i klinicka slika sarolika, bolest se vrlo cesto dijagnosticira kasno i krivo. Bolest se najcesce dijagnosticira kao depresivni poremecaj jer se u fazi manije bolesnici ne javljaju na lijecenje. Iz nepoznatog razloga se depresija povecava od 1910. godine i to najvise u industrijaliziranim zemljama svijeta. Depresija zauzima prvo mjesto među težim psihijatrijskim poremecajima. Osim sto broj oboljelih raste, dobna granica se pomice prema sve mlađom populacijom. Bolest najcesce pocinje nekim drugim psihickim poremecajima kao sto su: anksiozni poremecaji, ovisnosti i poremecaji hranjenja. Klinicki tijek bolesti može biti isprepleten remisijama gdje se ne upotrebljavaju lijekovi. Primarni poremecaj raspoloženja se pojavljuje kod osoba koje prethodno nisu bolovale od nekih drugih psihijatrijskih bolesti, osim od depresije ili hipomanije i prva dijagnoza im je dijagnoza bipolarnog poremecaja. Sekundarni poremecaj raspoloženja je poremecaj gdje su bolesnici prethodno bolovali od neke druge psihijatrijske bolesti osim manije i depresije i bipolarni afektivni poremecaj im nije prva primarna dijagnoza. Kvaliteta života je vrsta vrednovanja kvalitete u kojoj pojedinac živi i ovisi o mnogim faktorima kao sto su: opce psihofizicko zdravlje, primanja, uvjeti na radnom mjestu, okolina, sloboda, vjera i kultura. Jedan segment jako utjece na kvalitetu života, a taj segment je bolest. Kod bolesti ne dolazi samo do fizickih ili psihickih ostecenja, nego i do promjene samostalnosti, radne sposobnosti i može dovesti do stvaranja losih navika. Zbog svega toga se može javiti osjecaj bespomocnosti, smanjene samoefikasnosti, frustracije i smanjeno samopostovanje. Veliku ulogu kod oboljelih od bipolarnog poremecaja ima obitelj oboljelog te medicinske sestre/tehnicari. Obitelj je najbliža s oboljelima te zna sve pojedinosti o njemu i upoznata je s raznim metodama koje bi mogle olaksati stanje oboljelog, a da pritom te metode nisu primjena psihofarmaka. Medicinske sestre/tehnicari su također jako bitni u edukaciji i trajnom pracenju bolesnika. Medicinska sestra najveci dio vremena provodi pored pacijenta dok je on hospitaliziran te prati sve njegove promjene u vidu ponasanja ili poboljsanja/pogorsanja zdravstvenog stanja. Zdravstvena njega bolesnika koji boluju od bipolarnog poremecaja mora biti individualizirana i temeljena na holistickom pristupu. Svaki bolesnik je individua za sebe i ima razlicite potrebe i nacin ispunjavanja potreba od drugih i to najvise ovisi o jacini simptoma kod bolesnika. Bolesnici s jace izraženim simptomima ce imati sniženu moc i volju obavljati svoje fizioloske potrebe sami i na to treba pridodati posebnu pažnju. Bipolarni afektivni poremecaj je bolest koja vidno narusava kvalitetu života bolesnika, njegovu socijalnu i drustvenu funkciju, vodi u tesko kognitivno ostecenje i zbog svega toga je život ovakvih bolesnika otežan i skracen.",

      "title": "The clinical and therapeutic characteristics of the cyclic vomiting syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definition: The cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) belongs to the group of functional gastrointestinal diseases, however, there may be motility disturbances in the background. The syndrome is characterised by several, on average 3–4, recurrent vomiting episodes annually, which may last from hours to days, and is followed by symptom-free intervals. The CVS is not directly caused by metabolic or anatomic or other organic diseases. It begins with a characteristic prodromal phase followed by emesis with symptoms similar to encephalopathy. The syndrome mainly affecting children and is triggered by physical or emotional stress. Often, a disturbance in the mother-child relationship can be observed. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess our long term observations of patients suffering from CVS. Patients and methods: 14 patients were follow-up on. The average age of the 12 girls and 2 boys is at present time 19.2 years (7–29), their symptoms started at the typical age, on average at the age of 5.1 years (2–9). The vomiting episodes showed the typical choreography of the disease. During their hospitalisation (after pre-treatment at home) they underwent an EGG (electrogastrography) investigation (EGG-Medtronic 6.4 Digitrapper, ESPGHAN's 1999 working group criteria). Results: Number of patients/EGG results: 1 patient: tachygastria, 5 patients: dysrhytmia, 4 patients: slight dysrhytmia, 4 patients: negative results, 8 patients: failed running spectrum total power increase. Therapy: the treatment was limited to infusion, sedative, antiemetic, prokinetic and in some children ondansetron therapy, in the case of collaboration, the patients participated in psychotherapy. Their follow-up showed gradual spontaneous remission. Conclusion: the exact cause and appropriate treatment of CVS is still unknown. Current research supposes multicentric receptor dysfunction. One factor of the complex motility disorder is the myoelectric disturbance of the stomach, which needs further research.",

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

The onset of dementia can be abrupt, maximal, and static, e.g., following cardiac arrest or severe head trauma, or progressive such as occurs in the degenerative diseases of aging. Of the two forms the progressive types of dementia create by far the more frequent problem and, reflecting the increased longevity of the population, have become one of the major public health concerns of the Western world. Over 6% of adults aged over 65 years and 20% over the age of 80 are estimated to suffer from a medically or socially disabling degree of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Although rolandic epilepsy is the only epileptic syndrome that, at present, fully meets all the criteria of benignity and is widely recognized as such, there are also other forms of partial epilepsy that are benign. These are also genetically determined and age-dependent, occurring in neurologically intact children older than 18 months of age. As a rule, the seizures are brief and infrequent, usually responding well to antiepileptic drugs and remitting spontaneously before adulthood. The EEG background is normal, the morphology of the spikes is typical, and they are activated by sleep; generalized spike-wave discharges may occur. During the past decade, there have been reports of a number of additional syndromes of benign partial epilepsy. These include benign occipital epilepsy (the most common in this group), benign frontal epilepsy, benign epilepsy with affective symptomatology (or benign psychomotor epilepsy), benign epilepsy with extreme somatosensory evoked potentials, benign partial epilepsy of adolescence, and benign epilepsy associated with multiple spike foci. The Landau-Kleffner syndrome is often included among the benign epilepsies. These nonrolandic benign epilepsies are described in detail, and the relevant literature is reviewed.",

      "title": "Recognition and Differential Diagnosis of Psychosis in Primary Care.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Estudos de validação têm investigado várias linhas de corte dos estados mistos maníacos, dependendo do número de sintomas depressivos presentes no episódio maníaco. Paralelamente, crescem evidências acerca da existência de estados mistos depressivos, anteriormente descritos por Kraepelin, caracterizados por episódios depressivos com pelo menos três sintomas maníacos. O conhecimento sobre a terapêutica é limitado, pois deriva de ensaios clínicos de pacientes em mania que incluíram sujeitos em estados mistos. A ciclagem rápida é um tipo de curso do transtorno bipolar, definida pela presença de pelo menos quatro episódios distintos de mania, hipomania, depressão ou misto durante um ano. O tratamento é difícil e inclui a identificação de fatores de risco, como hipotireoidismo e transtornos relacionados ao uso de substâncias. Tanto nos estados mistos como na ciclagem rápida, preconiza-se evitar antidepressivos, quando possível. Neste trabalho são apresentadas formas clínicas dos estados mistos e algoritmos para o tratamento seqüencial de estados mistos maníacos e da ciclagem rápida baseadas nas evidências disponíveis na literatura.",

The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance.

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

      "abstract": "The frequency, differential diagnosis, and implications of depression occurring in the course of schizophrenia are considered in light of recently reported findings from a follow-up and family study of 500 psychiatric outpatients (the St. Louis 500 Study). Problems in diagnosis are illustrated in an interview of a schizophrenic patient with a history of depression. Nearly 60% of the schizophrenics studied had suffered a depressive syndrome during the course of their schizophrenic illness, supporting the observations of others. The majority of patients with a history of depression who were otherwise diagnosable as schizophrenic had a course of illness consistent with schizophrenia during follow-up. The pattern of illness among first-degree relatives suggested that intercurrent depression did not represent a biologic unity with primary affective disorder. Intercurrent depression should not be overinterpreted in excluding a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

Fordi depresjonssymptomene hos epilepsipasienter ofte er svingende og noe atypiske sammenliknet med symptomene hos pasienter med depresjon uten epilepsi, kan diagnostikken være vanskelig. Depresjoner kan ha en tidsmessig relasjon til anfallene (iktalt eller periiktalt), men vanligere er depresjoner som opptrer uavhengig av anfallene, dvs. interiktalt. Depresjonene kan ha nevrobiologiske, psykososiale og iatrogene årsaker. Særlig utsatte er de med temporolimbisk epilepsi, fokus i venstre hemisfære og/eller som får GABAerge medikamenter.

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

Es necesario identificar los mecanismos biologicos y psicologicos que subyacen en el desarrollo y persistencia delos trastornos emocionales tras un ictus; como la historia psiquiatrica previa, la localizacion y tipo de lesion, el tiempo desde el ictus, el grado de incapacidad fisica y cognitiva acompanante. Los estudios cientificos acerca del procesamiento emocional en estos pacientes se encuentran en su primera etapa.\nMETODO\n Estudio longitudinal, observacional. Inclusion: Pacientes (40-90 anos) con IC menor 10 dias de evolucion. Exclusion: AIT o ictus hemorragico; depresion previa; demencia, analfabetismo, deficit sensorial o afasia: GCS menor 14.

      "title": "Management of Recurrent Depression in Primary Care",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a major depressive episode of recent onset. She had 2 previous episodes 1 and 3 years earlier, which had been treated by her primary care physician with fluoxetine for 6 months each time. There is no evidence of bipolar illness. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent condition in the general population. Its chronic and recurrent nature is getting increasing attention [1]. Approximately 8 of 10 people experiencing a major depressive disorder will have 1 or more episodes during their lifetime, i.e., a recurrent major depressive disorder [2]. In some patients, the episodes are separated by many symptom-free years of normal functioning. For others, the episodes become increasingly frequent [3]. This latter course appears to be the more prevalent, both in psychiatric and primary care settings [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].Partial remission between episodes, not full recovery, appears to be the rule and is associated with residual disability [7]. At least 1 patient out of 3 is likely to relapse within a year [4, 5, 6]. Two major risk factors associated with relapse appear to be persistence of subthreshold or subclinical symptoms and number of episodes of major depression [4, 5, 6, 7]. As a result, for most people, depression is a life-long episodic disorder with multiple recurrences (averaging 1 episode in every 5-year period) [8].The adverse economic, interpersonal and medical consequences (e.g. work impairment, and family dysfunction) of the course of unipolar depression are considerable [1]. The case vignette thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or specialty settings. As our patient meets the criteria for recurrent depression developed by Frank et al. [10](≥3 episodes of unipolar depression, with the immediately preceding episode being no more than 2.5 years before the onset of the present episode), there is an 80–90% chance of relapse within 2 years from remission of depression and discontinuation of antidepressant treatment [10, 11].Since the chances of relapse are so high, the primary care physician would think of referral to a psychiatric specialist as the next logical step, relying on his/her clinical judgment for further therapeutic strategies. There is very little empirical support, however, that this choice, per se, entails substantial benefits for the patient. An impressive series of studies point to this conclusion.Simon et al. [12]compared the 6-month outcome in depressed patients receiving antidepressant prescriptions either from psychiatrists or primary care physicians. The proportion receiving antidepressant medication at an adequate dose for 90 days or more was similar in both cases (about 50%). The two groups showed similar rates of improvement in all measures of symptom severity and functioning [12]. Even collaboration between primary care physicians and mental health consultants [13]or implementation of clinical-practice guidelines and practice-based education [14]did not yield any significant advantage over usual care in long-term outcome.Three hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia who had recovered after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment by their primary care physicians were randomized to a relapse prevention program (involving a depression specialist) or usual primary care [15]. There were no significant differences in the relapse rate over a 12-month follow-up period.What emerges from these studies is the failure of the mental health specialist to improve the outcome of major depression in the primary care setting [16]. The introduction of more tolerable and easy-to-use antidepressant drugs, compared with the traditional tricyclics (which required dosages that nonpsychiatric physicians were reluctant to use), has blurred the difference among physicians in prescribing antidepressant drugs. At the same time, an impressive amount of pharmaceutical propaganda has clouded the evidence which underlies clinical decisions [17]. The main therapeutic strategies are now described, taking into consideration the most reliable findings available.Maintenance pharmacotherapy has been advocated as an effective tool for reducing relapses and recurrences in major depression [18, 19, 20]. A number of studies have demonstrated the superiority of antidepressant drugs (mostly tricyclics) against placebo in protecting the patient from relapsing [18, 19, 20]. Their average duration was 17 months [21]and only one small trial of imipramine reached 5 years [22]. Viguera et al. [23]analyzed 27 studies with variable length of antidepressant treatment which reported follow-up on drug discontinuation. Duration of drug treatment did not seem to affect long-term prognosis once the drug was discontinued. In clinical terms, this means that it does not matter whether you have treated a depressed patient for 3 months or 3 years, when you stop the drug. Indeed, there was a statistical trend which suggested that the longer the drug treatment, the higher was the likelihood of relapse [23]. An observational study on 236 unipolar patients, who had received antidepressants during recovery and were followed for an affective recurrence for up to 5 years, showed that the rate of recurrence for patients with fewer than 5 previous episodes was not affected by medication after the initial 8 months [24]. While benefits of long-term drug treatment have been clearly shown only in outpatients with major depression, we cannot assume that these can be achieved in the milder, heterogeneous forms of depression in primary care [19, 25].If we then consider the case vignette in light of the evidence we have summarized, we reach the following conclusions. One might judge the time of treatment with an antidepressant used by the primary care physician (6 months) in the previous 2 episodes as being too short and expect a more favorable outcome with a longer course of treatment (1 or 2 years). Certainly, during that time, the patient would be more protected from relapse than being drug free, but this would not affect the outcome after discontinuation of the antidepressant drug [23]. The problem would simply be postponed (table 1). One might expect this strategy to be valuable at a time when the patient is particularly exposed to stressful life circumstances. In a controlled study [26], however, maintenance pharmacotherapy was not found to be protective against life stress.Another option would be lifelong pharmacotherapy with antidepressant drugs. This, however, is not easy to communicate to the patient. Not infrequently, the physician starts with a gradual approach (telling the patient it will be for 1 or 2 years, while meaning indefinitely). Andrews [27]raised the issue of being more honest with people with recurrent depression and the need of long-term pharmacotherapy. However, if 'people have a right to the truth' [27], they are also entitled to the full story [28].Even though lifelong pharmacotherapy is chosen (table 2), there is the common and vexing problem of relapse during pharmacotherapy [29]. The return of depressive symptoms during long-term antidepressant treatment was found to occur in 9–57% of patients in published trials [30]. Possible explanations include pharmacological tolerance, loss of placebo effect, increase in disease severity, change in disease pathogenesis, accumulation of a detrimental metabolite, unrecognized rapid cycling, and prophylactic inefficacy [30]. A number of pharmacological strategies have been suggested in uncontrolled and often small trials for addressing this loss of efficacy (increase or decrease in dose, augmentation, change to a different drug), but specific guidelines do not exist [30]. In the first and only large-scale controlled trial [31], about 1 patient out of 3 relapsed during a 3.5-month maintenance treatment with fluoxetine. Two of the 3 patients relapsing while on fluoxetine responded to a blindly determined double dose of fluoxetine. However, part of these patients (11% of the initial ones) relapsed again while on doubled fluoxetine, despite the relatively short follow-up [31]. The patient should thus be warned that loss of clinical effects during long-term pharmacotherapy does occur, despite adequate compliance. Increasing the dose could be effective (at least temporarily), but depression can also become treatment resistant. Results from one study [32]suggest that full doses are superior to lower doses in the maintenance phase. Lower doses, however, are less likely to produce side effects [32]and more likely to allow a successful response by increasing the dosage when there is a loss of clinical effect [29]. The occurrence of side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunctions [21]may undermine compliance and quality of life.Lithium has been found to reduce relapses in unipolar depression [33]. However, also with lithium, progressive loss of clinical effect has been reported [34, 35]. Certainly reemergence of depressive symptoms in allegedly unipolar depressed patient treated with antidepressants calls for reconsideration of differential diagnosis, with particular reference to milder forms of bipolar disorder [29].Recurrence of depression in the case vignette can also be managed by treatment of the new episode with the same or other antidepressant and discontinuation when remission ensues [36]. The appearance of prodromal symptoms generally precedes the full syndrome by weeks or months [36]. An early intervention upon relapse was found to significantly shorten the length of the depressive episode [37]. As a result, relatively frequent follow-up visits and education of patients and their family members to recognize the patient's characteristic prodromal symptoms (which appear to be similar across episodes of the same patient) may potentially increase the efficacy of this approach [36]. This treatment, which is in line with approaches to recurrent disorders in clinical medicine, requires the establishment of a good patient-doctor relationship and a lower degree of compliance compared with the long-term pharmacotherapy. It should also be observed that a substantial proportion of patients discontinue antidepressant therapy after responding to the initial acute phase of treatment, regardless of the physician's advise [38, 39, 40, 41].Two main disadvantages may, however, be present (table 1). One is given by the phenomenon of resistance [29]: the likelihood that a drug treatment may be associated with a diminished chance of response in those patients who successfully responded to it but discontinued it. This phenomenon was considered to be relatively rare. In a naturalistic 6-year follow-up of depressed patients where the intermittent pharmacotherapy was used and patients were treated with the same antidepressant of the initial episode, it was found to take place only in 4% of instances [42]. However, the first study which assessed the efficacy prospectively of reinitiating exactly the same treatment (fluoxetine) in patients who had a depressive relapse upon drug discontinuation [43], provided a different picture. Thirty-eight percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after reinitiation of fluoxetine. The second disadvantage has to do with discontinuation syndromes which may occur, particularly with SSRI, despite tapering [44, 45].The presence of residual symptoms, despite drug or psychotherapeutic treatment, has been strongly correlated with poor long-term outcome [7]. Further, some residual symptoms of major depression may progress to become prodromal symptoms of relapse [7]. This has led to the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive behavioral therapy in its residual phase [46]. In randomized controlled trials [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50], the various applications of this model have been found to yield a lower relapse rate in recurrent depression. Preliminary studies have suggested its usefulness also in atypical depression [51], bipolar disorder [52], and when loss of clinical effects occurs during long-term antidepressant treatment [53]. Its preventive effects appeared to be related to abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being and coping skills. The practical steps for implementing this approach are described in table 2 and detailed elsewhere [46]. It may include discontinuation of antidepressant drug treatment, as outlined in table 2, or its maintenance. It may offer the advantage of yielding enduring effects while limiting the exposure to and costs of drug therapy. There are two main disadvantages (table 1). One is given by the fact that patients should be motivated to undergo a short-term (10–20 sessions) psychotherapeutic treatment while they are apparently well. The other is the fact that, while the other strategies may be pursued by a nonspecialist physician, implementation of the sequential approach requires referral to a specialized psychotherapist.Information is needed about several clinical issues surrounding recurrent depression.Attention has been called to the arbitrary nature of the distinction between treatment response associated with residual symptomatology and refractory depression [54]. At present, we do not know whether different antidepressant drugs may entail different rates of residual symptoms. What we know is that there may be differential remission rates, as was found to be the case for amitriptyline [55]and venlafaxine [56]. The question would be crucial in view of the role of residual symptoms in recurrent depression [54]. Similarly, we do not know whether combinations of antidepressant drugs, as they are used in treatment resistant depression [57], may yield a more pervasive recovery than a single antidepressant.Whether different antidepressant drugs or different dosages of the same antidepressant drug may engender different rates of loss of clinical effects is another crucial, unanswered clinical question [29]. At present, we have only one, large-scale, controlled study [31]on the effects of increasing the dosage of antidepressants. Other strategies, such as switching to a different type of antidepressant, have not been investigated in controlled studies [30]. We also need to know more about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying tolerance to antidepressant drugs [58].Similarly, we do not know whether lack of response to an antidepressant which is reinstituted after a drug-free period in the same patient and which was found to be effective, may differ among drugs [54]. We also need to compare intermittent and continuation pharmacotherapy in controlled studies.Adding cognitive behavioral psychotherapy to the treatment package of recurrent depression was found to yield long-term benefits in terms of relapse rate [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Both discontinuation and maintenance of pharmacotherapy have been used in the sequential approach, but have not been directly compared in controlled studies. Is there an advantage in keeping drug treatment after psychotherapy?Guidelines for the treatment of depression are available to clinicians. Both those developed by the American Psychiatric Association [59]and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Practice Guidelines [60], while providing evidence-based data on the management of the acute phase of depression, do not provide adequate discussion of the different strategies that recurrent depression entails. Evidence indicates that both antidepressant pharmacotherapy and time-limited depression-targeted psychotherapies are efficacious in primary care settings [59]. The Primary Care Guideline Panel recommended maintenance pharmacotherapy for patients with histories of 3 or more depressive episodes and vulnerability to future recurrences because of associated risk factors [60]. Guidelines for treating depression in primary care were developed also in Australia and New Zealand [61]. They suggested at least 2 years of continuation of pharmacotherapy for repeated episodes or where there were other risk factors for relapse [61].Hollon and Shelton [62]show how treatment guidelines for major depressive disorders understate the case for the empirically supported psychosocial interventions. Another important aspect in the development of guidelines is the issue of conflict of interest of those involved in them [63, 64, 65], which disclosure fails to correct [66].The World Health Organization ranked major depression as the fourth most disabling medical disorder by disability-adjusted life years, a measure of burden [67]. By 2010, World Health Organization projected, major depression will be ranked second unless meaningful improvements occur in prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The case illustrated in the vignette outlines the difficulties that prevention of depressive recurrences entails. On the basis of evidence available, the following approach is outlined.First, the patient should be offered adequate information about the prognosis of her depressive illness. It is unlikely that a new course of treatment with the same or similar antidepressant will favorably affect her condition. Andrews [27]remarks that many doctors are concerned that telling people the true prognosis will cause their depression to worsen. However, this very much depends on the content and modalities of the communication. In our Affective Disorders Program, we share with our patients that depression is likely to recur [28]. In the case vignette, we would tell her that depression is very likely to ensue again once antidepressant drugs are stopped. So, one option would be to continue with an antidepressant drug indefinitely. We would tell her, however, that also this option is not completely risk free, since loss of clinical effect may occur. The other option would be to start working on prevention of the next episode. For doing this, we would need to view depression not as something coming 'out of a clear sky', but as a result of a maladaptive lifestyle. Depressed patients are often unaware of the consequences of long-term minor life stresses, interpersonal friction, prolonged anxiety, excessive work, and inadequate rest [11]. It is ironic that, while psychiatrists tend to view prevention of relapse of depression purely in pharmacological terms, as if it were a disease such as diabetes [27], diabetologists, as other medical specialists, emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological strategies [68]. This second option is more difficult to pursue, but is likely to yield enduring effects. We would also explain to the patient that a longer course of treatment with an antidepressant drug this time would be unlikely to yield a better prognosis once the drug is discontinued [23]. In our clinical experience, patients generally look favorably to pursuing a treatment strategy that may provide long-term effects.If the patient described in the vignette accepted to try to pursue a sequential approach, we would treat her with the same drug that was used in the previous 2 episodes. If resistance occurs, we would switch her to a different type of antidepressant (a drug affecting both serotonin and noradrenaline, such as a tricyclic). After 3 months of treatment, we would reassess the patient carefully (table 2). Is she well or simply better? What is the level of residual symptomatology? Such an assessment may require both structured interviews and self-observation (diary). A helpful example which we make is the following. 'When we first saw you, you were very depressed. Driving the way you did, you went off the road. With antidepressant drugs, we did put you back on the road. Things are much better now. However, if you keep on driving the way you used to, you may end up off the road again, sooner or later' [46]. The example outlines the need for lifestyle modification and introduces a sense of control in the patient as to his or her depressive illness. This psychological preparation paves the way for subsequent psychotherapeutic approaches.The clinician could then refer the patient for a short-term (10–20 sessions) course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. This would be the psychotherapeutic approach of choice, since it has been specifically studied for its preventive effects [46]. We would be inclined to taper antidepressant drugs during the course of psychotherapeutic treatment (table 2). Tapering should be performed at the slowest possible pace, to minimize the risk of antidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes [21, 59]. There are no significant differences in relapse rates off medication between studies involving rapid discontinuation and those in which tapering was more gradual [23]. Slow tapering, however, may allow the detection of emerging symptoms in their prodromal phases, which may become the target of psychotherapeutic strategy [54]. Interventions that bring the person out of a negative functioning are one form of success, but facilitating progression toward psychological well-being is quite another [69]. This is an emerging area for psychotherapeutic research and practice [46, 69]. The advantages of maintaining the patient on antidepressant drugs are not clear, unless one aims to keep pharmacotherapy indefinitely and to use the addition of a psychotherapy only as a boosting strategy.A final aspect of the sequential approach lies in a careful assessment of the patient once both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been terminated. If improvement appears to have occurred, the patient can be seen at regular follow-up visits, geared not only to verify the presence of depressive relapses, but also to assess the subclinical symptomatology [7]. If substantial residual symptomatology persists despite clinical response or minimal or no benefits have been achieved by psychotherapeutic approach, then indefinite drug treatment can be discussed with the patient. In our clinical experience, however, the patient has gained a better psychological acceptance of a pharmacological approach. Whether this should be indefinite or intermittent (table 1), very much depends on the patient's preferences and the patient-doctor relationship (with ensuing opportunities for monitoring the patient). Clinical indicators for indefinite, instead of intermittent, drug therapy could be rapid onset of depression with suicidal ideations and the likelihood of severe discontinuation syndromes in a specific patient.Prevention of recurrence in major depression cannot simply be based on prolongation of ongoing pharmacological treatment. The evidence available suggests that the active collaboration of the patient (in choosing a treatment option, in lifestyle modification, in seeking treatment again when needed) is a crucial, and yet neglected variable. This can lead to a more rational use of antidepressant drugs and to therapeutic efforts of more enduring quality than those prevailing today [70].This paper was supported in part by grants from the Ministero dell' Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (MURST, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F. and N.S. and by a grant from the 'Mental Health Evaluation Project' (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F.

No absolute correlation was found between stability of agoraphobia and severity of panic disorder (frequency and intensity of panic attacks). It was established that APD with manifestations of agoraphobia had been, perhaps, conditioned by the presence of comorbid disturbances in their structure which had determined peculiarities of the patients' behavior. Two types of prolonged APD with agoraphobic phenomena were recognized. Retention of agoraphobic disturbances in conditions of the first type was related to symptoms of generalized somatic disorder (generalized somatic anxiety) in clinical pattern of APD. Manifestations similar to panphobias prevailed, agoraphobic avoidance included all the situations in which the patient could find himself without help. In the states of the second type retention of agoraphobic disorders was conditioned by comorbidity of APD with asthenohypochondriac manifestations with somato-psychic fragility in their structure. Anxiety of expectation was formed in situations with emotional or physical tension. Agoraphobic avoidance in conditions of this type had displayed the character of preventive measures and one of manifestations of hypochondriac development of personality. The presence of pronounced anxiety (intensive panic attacks, generalized anxiety) in clinical pattern of prolonged agoraphobic conditions can serve a predictor of a favourable development of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Some clinical observations lead us to study the possible consequences of the olfaction drive in three quite different domains. First, in the erotic experience in general, where smell is typically considered as objet petit a, triggering the affective charge of the phantasy. Then, in “normal” mournings or even pathological ones (of which fetishism and the clinical history of anorexia-bulimia are the manifestations par excellence). Finally, in the hallucination phenomena of psychosis, or even in the subjective conditions that precede some instances of acting out, especially in manic-depressive psychosis.",

Ao longo do curso da doença, podem ser observadas manifestações clínicas de diversas naturezas: cognitivas,com declínio na capacidade mnêmica, de linguagem, visuoespacial, habilidades construcionais, função executiva, entre outras; comportamentais, como depressão, ansiedade, comportamento violento/agitado; insônia; comprometimento da capacidade de realização de atividades de vida diária; impacto sobre independência e qualidade de vida do paciente e seu cuidador. Atualmente, o tratamento da DA se baseia no uso de inibidores da colinesterase, com a proposta de estabilizar ou alentecer o curso da doença.As evidências disponíveis sugerem uma melhora média de -2,7 pontos (intervalo de confiança de 95%: -3,0 a -2,3) na faixa de 70 pontos na Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) por um período de 6 meses a 1 ano em pacientes com demência leve, moderada e grave, além de melhor controle dos sintomas comportamentais associados.

      "title": "Testing cognition may contribute to the diagnosis of movement disorders",
      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

      "title": "Is it depression or is it bipolar depression?",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This review is intended to guide primary care providers in differentiating patients with bipolar depression from those with unipolar depression and inform patient management. Up to 64% of clinical encounters for depression occur in primary care, with misdiagnosis of bipolar depression common in both primary care and psychiatry. Although bipolar disorder is characterized by manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes, the most common and debilitating symptomatic presentation is depression. Misdiagnosis as unipolar depression is common, often resulting in mistreatment with an unopposed monoamine antidepressant. Antidepressants are often ineffective for treating bipolar depression and may cause detrimental consequences such as treatment-emergent hypomania/mania, rapid cycling, or increased suicidality. Factors that are suggestive of bipolar disorder versus unipolar depression include early-onset depression, frequent depressive episodes, family history of serious mental illness, hypomania/mania symptoms within the depressive episode, and nonresponse to antidepressants. Comorbid medical (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity) and psychiatric (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorders, and substance use disorder) conditions are common and contribute to premature mortality for patients with bipolar disorder compared with the general public. Cariprazine, fluoxetine/olanzapine, lurasidone, and quetiapine are approved to treat bipolar depression; only cariprazine and quetiapine are approved to treat both bipolar mania and depression. Primary care providers who can differentiate presenting symptoms of bipolar depression from unipolar depression and offer appropriate treatment options will optimize patient care in clinical practice. Relevant information for this review was identified through a multistep literature search of PubMed using the terms bipolar depression/bipolar disorder plus other relevant terms.",

Differentiating confusion, fear, or irritability following a seizure from a postictal psychosis requires careful history taking. Psychosis can also be the result of a comorbid illness; one should also consider potential causes such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The timing of symptoms is a key consideration when trying to determine if someone has a postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis is classically preceded by a lucid interval, followed by a prolonged period of psychosis lasting more than 24 hours. Treatment with antipsychotic medications is often required. For many patients, antipsychotic medications can be discontinued once symptoms resolve.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms: Characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both. Negative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience. However, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms. This chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. This chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

The persistent abnormal cenesthesia full of agony was rather tinged with hallucination, and it was some experience of moving, tense or pulling sensations, or of utterly new strange foreign sensations. Despite the peculiar strange complaints, they did not make pathological interpretations and their insight into their morbid states was preserved to some extent. But, pathological obsessive attitudes (such as skin-rubbing) and temporary abulic states often appeared, so that in their course they wore temporarily psychotic feature.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms can be associated with several systemic and central nervous system infections and they can be the initial presenting symptoms, occurring in the absence of neurological symptoms in some disorders as in some cases of viral encephalitis. They could also be part of the clinical picture in other cases such as psychosis or mood symptoms secondary to brucellosis or toxoplasmosis. Late-onset neuropsychiatric complications may also occur several years following the infection such as in the case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to measles. Some Infectious diseases may have possible etiological role for major psychiatric disorders, based on yet unconfirmed reports for viral infectious diseases (e.g. Influenza virus and HSV-1) which are thought to have risk for developing schizophrenia and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects can occur due to drugs (e.g. mefloquine, interferon-alpha) that are used for treatment of infectious diseases. Psychiatric symptoms can also be reactivated resulting from chronic, complicated and serious infections such as HIV that can lead to depression, anxiety or adjustment disorders, although CNS involvement can also be a possible etiological factor. Patients suffering from primary and severe psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of contracting infection; that is mainly related to high risk behaviors in patients with mania or schizophrenia. It is also important to consider that the co-occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and infection can be incidental (i.e. infectious diseases can occur in psychiatric patients regardless of the above mentioned factors). Early identification of the underlying etiology for organic/secondary psychiatric symptoms is essential for appropriate intervention and early treatment of the primary condition that could be the etiology of psychiatric symptoms so as to avoid unnecessary long-term psychiatric treatment and to avoid complications of possible misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of the primary condition.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The neurologic dysfunction underlying epilepsy can predispose patients to psychiatric disorders, and the incidence of both depression and psychosis is increased in people with epilepsy. Depressive disorders are the most frequently recognized psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, but depression in children can be particularly difficult to recognize. Clinicians need to inquire about not only classic symptoms of depression such as anhedonia but also less obvious symptoms such as unprovoked irritability, unsubstantiated complaints of lack of love from family members, somatic complaints, and problems with concentration and poor school performance. The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children with epilepsy and mental retardation is even more difficult. Physicians need to be alert for the presence of iatrogenic depression, which may result from antiepileptic drugs or epilepsy surgery. People with epilepsy are also at increased risk for psychosis, which can be interictal, postictal, or (rarely) an expression of ictal activity. This psychosis can be related to seizure remission (ie, alternative psychosis) or iatrogenic (eg, related to antiepileptic drugs or following temporal lobectomy). Although both antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase seizures, careful drug selection, dosing, and slow titration can minimize this risk, allowing treatment to proceed.

      "abstract": "1. Approximately 3% of the population (6 to 7 million persons in the United States) is mentally retarded. Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

D’abord, les diagnostics syndromiques sont modifiés. La définition de l’épisode dépressif caractérisé est simplifiée avec la suppression du critère d’exclusion lié au deuil. Ce choix, qui a pour but de mieux prendre en charge les dépressions post-deuil, a fait l’objet de nombreuses discussions et controverses. La définition de l’épisode maniaque ou hypomaniaque est également modifiée avec l’adjonction du symptôme modification de l’activité et de l’énergie [1]. Et les épisodes mixtes sont supprimés des diagnostics syndromiques et ré-intégrés comme caractéristiques spécifiques des troubles dépressifs ou bipolaires. Ce choix est secondaire aux excès antérieurs de diagnostics d’épisodes mixtes. Pour les chapitres troubles dépressifs [1] et troubles bipolaires [1], de nouvelles caractéristiques spécifiques apparaissent : les caractéristiques mixtes [1] (définies pour les épisodes dépressifs majeurs par la présence de 3 symptômes maniaques), les symptômes anxieux [1], et les caractéristiques spécifiques de risque suicidaire. Par ailleurs, de nouvelles entités sont introduites dans le chapitre troubles dépressifs [1]. Il s’agit du trouble dysphorique pré-menstruel, qui figurait auparavant dans l’appendice, et d’un nouveau trouble de l’enfant, le disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [1]. Enfin, dans le chapitre entités nécessitant de nouvelles études [1], apparaissent Ies épisodes dépressifs avec hypomanie de courte durée, le deuil pathologique complexe et persistant et les comportements suicidaires pathologiques. Ces différentes modifications devraient permettre, via leur remboursement, une meilleure prise en charge, aux États-Unis, du deuil pathologique, du risque suicidaire et du syndrome pré-menstruel pathologique.",

      "title": "Acute psychosis as the presenting manifestation of lupus: case reports",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

While their case shared several important clinical features with ours, it differed from ours in other respects, including (1) a briefer period of coma (a few hours) with absence of neurological deficits on awakening, (2) normal neuroimaging, and (3) a longer latency between the head trauma and the onset of the syndrome. We reported 3 cases of a delayed-onset, pancerebellar syndrome that developed 6 weeks to 2 years after head trauma. All the patients had a severe insult, followed by a prolonged period of coma (2 days to 2 months). Other neurological deficits (eg, focal weakness, cranial nerve palsies, or cognitive abnormalities) were uniformly present on awakening. On neuroimaging, lesions were present in the thalamus",

      "abstract": "The DSM-III-R subclassifies panic disorder (PD) under the anxiety disorders (or anxiety and phobic neuroses) along with phobic, obsessive compulsive (OCD), generalized anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although allowances are made for the specification of the current degree of impairment as severe, e.g., at least eight panic attacks monthly, avoidance behavior resulting in being completely house-bound or compulsions being the major life activity, the anxiety disorder category does not provide for the simultaneous occurrence of associated psychotic features as part of the disorder. In fact, depending on the circumstances, diagnostic hierarchial principles, in the DSM-III-R, require dual diagnoses or a diagnosis of the more pervasive disorder only, if elements of both anxiety and psychosis are present. In contradistinction to the anxiety disorder category, the DSM-III-R recognizes a myriad of psychotic features, including delusions, hallucinations, thought insertion and broadcasting, as extreme manifestations of the affective syndromes. The following case report of a patient with panic disorder, culminating in a florid psychosis, puts into question current official nosology. Conflicting outcome data from the schizophreniform disorders may be due, in part, to the mislabelling of patients with psychoses secondary to severe anxiety disorders as schizophreniform.",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

Early awakening or terminal insomnia is most described in the depressive conditions. Hypersomnia may be the main symptom in some depressive disorders, as seasonal depression, depression with atypical features or depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Polysomnographic evaluation shows, in general, a significative reduction in the efficiency and total time of sleep, in detriment to the amount of slow wave sleep.

Este topico lo vienen confirmando los estudios epidemiologicos que muestran una prevalencia mayor de trastornos mentales en la poblacion de personas con asma que la que se encuentra en la poblacion general, tanto adultacomo infantil y adolescente. Los trastornos mas prevalentes son los de ansiedad, en especial los de panico y ansiedad generalizada, y los depresivos, con tasas hasta cuatro veces superiores a las de la poblacion general sana. Pero tambien se han constatado cifras anormalmente elevadas de los trastornos de estres, especialmente estres post-traumatico, y los relacionados con abuso de sustancias, entre otros. En suma, una gama amplia de psicopatologias cuya importancia en relacion con el asma es variable, pero cuya identificacion es parte ineludible del tratamiento del asma. Ademas, algunos estudios constatan que en unos casos el asma precede a las patologias mentales, y en otros sucede a la inversa. El objetivo de esta revision es ofrecer informacion actualizada sobre la comorbilidad entre asma y los trastornos mentales mencionados, las razones que se aducen para explicarla, y las consecuencias que tienen para el tratamiento del asma. Tomados en conjunto, los datos procedentes de los estudios revisados indican la posibilidad de una asociacion bi-direccional entre asma y trastornos mentales, con algunos mecanismos causales comunes que, de confirmarse, requerira cambios en los planteamientos terapeuticos cuando sea evidente que existe concurrencia clinicamente significativa entre asma y trastorno mental.",

El TCE puede actuar como agente etiopatogenico primario (psicosis debida a un TCE) o precipitante (esquizofrenia) en los cuadros psicoticos manifestados. Los dos criterios externos que contribuyen en mayor medida a la distincion de ambos trastornos son la escasa sintomatologia negativa y la baja vulnerabilidad genetica entre las personas con psicosis debida a un TCE.

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a common, serious neurological disease, with prevalence of 1% and a cumulative lifetime risk of 5%. An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Die wichtigste Differenzialdiagnose ist die Schizophrenie, aber auch das Alkoholdelir oder drogeninduzierte Psychosen. Die Prognose ist in den meisten Fällen gut, zur Akuttherapie werden Neuroleptika eingesetzt. Sehr selten ist der alkoholische Eifersuchtswahn, der manchmal als Residuum einer chronischen Alkoholhalluzinose persistiert, sich meistens aber schleichend entwickelt und monosymptomatisch bleibt. Gefürchtet sind die aus dem Eifersuchtswahn resultierenden Gewaltdelikte. Die Therapie ist meist schwierig, Neuroleptika nur begrenzt wirksam.",

Il s’agit d’un trouble de la motivation caractérisé par des manifestations comportementales, cognitives et émotionnelles telles qu’une perte d’intérêt et une moindre participation aux activités de la vie quotidienne, un manque d’initiative, peu de persévérance dans les activités entamées, une indifférence et un émoussement affectif. Il ne s’agit pas uniquement d’un symptôme de la dépression ou d’un signe d’entrée dans la démence mais l’apathie existe en tant que syndrome à part entière. Elle a été longtemps sous-diagnostiquée en raison d’une absence de consensus au sujet de sa définition. Néanmoins, des critères de diagnostic ont récemment été publiés et leur validité a été éprouvée et démontrée dans plusieurs maladies neuropsychiatriques . De plus, un certain nombre d’échelles sont aujourd’hui reconnues pour leur validité dans le dépistage ou l’évaluation du syndrome apathique . D’un point de vue physiopathologique, les mécanismes à l’origine du syndrome apathique restent encore à élucider mais il est généralement admis que les comportements motivés mettent en œuvre le système limbique. Le circuit striato-frontal ventral (reliant le striatum ventral aux régions ventro-médianes du cortex préfrontal) semble particulièrement impliqué. Le rôle des voies dopaminergiques est également démontré même si d’autres neuro-modulateurs semblent également impliqués. L’apathie accroît fortement le fardeau des aidants et compte tenu de son impact sur le niveau fonctionnel et la qualité de vie des patients, elle mérite une attention particulière, notamment un dépistage systématique et une prise en charge précoce.",

      "title": "Hyponatremia-induced psychosis in an industrial setting",
      "abstract": "The Editor, Symptoms of hyponatremia can range from increased psychotic symptoms to seizures, coma and even death. To observe the incidence of complications in severely hyponatremic hospitalized patients and relate outcome to rate of correction, all patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in New York City and a group of hospitals in Oxford with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L were studied. There were 84 episodes in New York and 100 in Oxford over a period of 9.5 months and 1 year, respectively; 79% had chronic hyponatremia (>3 days’ duration). During hyponatremia, 76% of patients had clouding of consciousness, with 11% in coma. Other hyponatremic complications included long track signs (including hemiparesis) (6.0%), seizures (3.3%), hallucinations (0.5%), tremor (1.0%), intellectual impairment without clouding of consciousness (0.5%) and acute psychosis (0.5%). As many as 4.3% of the patients died as a direct result of their electrolyte disturbance. After correction, central pontine myelinolysis (0.5%), post-correction seizures (1.0%), intellectual impairment (2.2%), tremor (0.5%), paresthesiae (0.5%) and striatal syndrome (0.5%) were observed. Correction of hyponatremia was started in 158 patients, and the mean maximum rate of correction in 24 hours was 8.4 mmol/L (SD, 5.6; range, 2-42). The maximum rate of correction was higher in those who developed neurological sequelae (12.1 mmol/L/24 h vs. 8.2 mmol/L/24 h; P = .0125, t test, separate variance, two-tail). Neurological sequelae were associated with faster rates of correction, and correction of chronic severe hyponatremia should be < 10 mmol/L in 24 hours (Ellis, 1995). Over a 3-year period, 15 patients with severe hyponatremia were referred to our emergency room from a nearby psychiatric institution. This article reports on 36 episodes of symptomatic hyponatremia in those 15 patients. All but two of the patients were receiving antipsychotic medications; 1 patient was taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and 1 patient was taking an oral hypoglycemic agent. Thirteen patients were chronic schizophrenics, 1 patient had a bipolar depressive disorder with psychotic features and 1 patient had no psychiatric disorder. Patients presented with seizures, change in mental status, and vegetative symptoms (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) associated with hyponatremia and water intoxication. Exacerbation of the patients’ underlying illness, psychogenic polydipsia, compulsive smoking, alcoholic cirrhosis, drug abuse and neuroleptic and other medications are thought to be the major causes of acute hyponatremia in these patients (Ellinas et al., 1993). Hyponatremia has also been reported as an unusual side effect of drugs like tricyclic antidepressants (Sharma and Pompei, 1996), thiazides (Haensch et al., 1996), carbamazepine (Schmitz and Trimble, 1995) and lisinopril (Giupponi and Erfurth, 1998). Here we report a case of an industrial worker without a past or family history of psychiatric disorder who developed psychotic symptoms due to hyponatremia caused probably by dehydration. An employee, 34-year-old, Hindu, married male, working in a large aluminum plant had symptoms characterized by intense perspiration, weakness, lethargy precipitated by higher temperature in the plant. Within few minutes, he was seen to be behaving abnormally in the form of irrelevant talk, poor reality testing and perplexity. He was brought to the emergency department of the factory hospital. Vitals were normal. Investigation in the form of hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, blood for malarial parasite, and serum electrolytes was ordered. Results of all investigations were normal except serum sodium of 111 mEq/L. He was given IV sodium chloride 2 pint over 3 hours. With this, there was marked improvement in the abnormal behavior. He was completely normal after 6 hours and discharged and counseled for increased salt intake due to heat and the nature of his job. This case history depicts hyponatremia-induced psychosis. Fluid-electrolyte balance is regulated within a narrow range, and disturbances in this system are unusual in animals and humans. Studies from the preneuroleptic era to date suggest that up to 25% of patients with schizophrenia have polydipsia, suggesting that it is related to the pathophysiology of the psychoses. Polydipsia and the related phenomenon of hyponatremia cause considerable mortality and morbidity. Prevalence studies are limited by imprecise measures available at present. The treatment was limiting water intake when patients reached critical levels of water retention, which however did not improve polydipsia. Recent case reports and open studies have shown that clozapine improves both polydipsia and water retention. The response occurs at low doses and is not related to improvement in psychosis. This may not be applicable to all patients, and better understanding of the pathophysiology of polydipsia-hyponatremia would lead to more empirically derived treatments (Verghese et al., 1996). The unique feature of the present case is that unlike most cases reported in the literature, the patient was not suffering from any psychiatric disorder and had no past or family history of psychiatric disorders. He developed hyponatremia due to dehydration secondary to high temperatures in the workplace. However, the response to appropriate therapy was prompt and complete.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> This case report of Transient Epileptic Amnesia (TEA) is presented due to the prolonged nature of the amnestic episodes, the significant delay to the correct diagnosis and the various diagnoses given to the patient in the meantime. <h3>Method</h3> Patient case presentation: Over a 34-month period a 62-year-old woman was seen in three different health settings before a correct diagnosis was provided. She experienced a total of nine episodes of transient amnesia (frequency: every 3–4 months; duration: 10 days; precipitant: stress and fatigue; occurrence: on waking from a “deep sleep”; precedent: gustatory hallucination; memory disturbance: partial anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia for past events). Over the 3 years, she was given the following diagnoses by different clinicians of Transient Global Amnesia (TGA), Psychogenic Amnesia and then TEA. Following this, she received treatment with anti-epileptic drugs, which terminated any further episodes. <h3>Discussion</h3> Attacks usually last between 20 min to 60 min. However, in this case it was 10 days, which may be due to ongoing seizure activity or persistent post-ictal dysfunction of memory related brain structures. It took up to three times longer than the median time to diagnosis of 12 months for the correct diagnosis to be made. This may be due to the investigations being carried out inter-ictally, and the standard neuropsychological tests lacking sufficient sensitive to identify subtle memory disturbances. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The importance of correctly diagnosing the condition are: (1) Effective treatment. (2) Under-diagnosed. (3) Patients are always distressed by them, fearing the onset of dementia.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

      "title": "El dolor en la enfermedad de Parkinson. Implicaciones autonómicas y afectivas",
      "abstract": "RESUMEN Introduccion y objetivo: La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa, la segunda con mayor prevalencia, despues de la enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA). La enfermedad presenta tanto sintomas motores como ?no motores?, entre los que se encuentra disfuncion autonomica, dolor, deterioro cognitivo, ansiedad, depresion, entre otros. El dolor en la EP, a pesar de su frecuencia, sigue siendo un sintoma infravalorado, infradiagnosticado e infratratado. Nuestro objetivo principal es evaluar la frecuencia y configuracion del dolor en la EP y sus implicaciones afectivas y autonomicas. Pacientes, material y metodos: Estudio multicentrico, transversal, de caracter retrospectivo y prospectivo. Se incluyeron 407 pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) de los que un 70% estaban en una situacion leve-moderada (estadios 2 o 3 de Hoehn y Yahr), con edad media de 65,01 anos y 7,07 anos de duracion de la EP. Se administraron las escalas SCOPA-Motor, SCOPA-Autonomica, SCOPA-Cog, Parkinson?s Psychosis Rating Scale modificada, Hoehn & Yarh, las Escala Hospitalaria de Ansiedad y Depresion, Dolor (EVA frecuencia), EQ-5D y estudios neurofisiologicos especificos de Sistema Nervioso Autonomo (SNA). El analisis estadistico se ha realizado con el programa de calculo estadistico SPSS version 22. Resultados: En nuestro estudio encontramos una prevalencia del dolor elevada (72%) y los pacientes afirman mayoritariamente (79,2%) que su dolor tiene relacion con la EP. La duracion de la enfermedad se correlaciona con la intensidad y frecuencia del dolor (dolor intensidad: r: 0,138; p< 0,01; dolor frecuencia: r: 0,168; p< 0,01 ). A mayor evolucion de la EP mayor es la percepcion del dolor. El 60% de los pacientes de EP manifiestan sentir dolor cuando aparecen episodios de rigidez y tirantez en alguno de los miembros superiores o inferiores frente a un 40% que no. Curiosamente un numero mayor (el 76% de los pacientes) siente dolor durante los episodios de discinesias frente a un 24% que no lo percibe. Sin embargo, en la EP el dolor se relaciona mas con la situacion afectiva que con la motora, como hemos podido demostrar la relacion entre el Dolor Total y la HADS (Depresion) Total y la Escala Hoehn & Yahr. El coeficiente de contingencia es mayor en la depresion (C: 0,894; N=403) que en la situacion motora (C: 0,637; N=401). El dolor evoluciona y se percibe de forma paralela a otros sintomas no motores (animo, nicturia, alteracion del control vesical, estrenimiento, etc.) pero con lo que se relaciona mas es con la situacion afectiva del paciente parkinsoniano (ansiedad (r: 0,40; p < 0,01), depresion (r: 0.28; p < 0,01). La mayor asociacion se encuentra entre la ansiedad y el dolor, seguida de la depresion y en menor grado nicturia y sialorrea. Existe una correlacion positiva entre las dos subescalas de la HADS (depresion y ansiedad). Existe una alta prevalencia de alteracion de la memoria inmediata como sintoma ?no motor? (SNM) en nuestra serie (96,5%). En base a nuestros resultados el sexo femenino se asocia al dolor en la EP. Con respecto a la fenomenologia el dolor en la EP es muy variable. Se percibe con mayor frecuencia como una corriente electrica (64%), calor (60%), frialdad (60%), punzante (52%), difuso (52%), interno (40%), acorchamiento u hormigueo (40%), La frecuencia de la cantidad de tipos de dolor es la siguiente: un tipo de dolor (12%), dos tipos de dolores (16%) y tres tipos de dolores (72%). La media de tipos de dolor en nuestro estudio es superior a 2 tipos (x ?: 2,60 ± 0,63; rango: 1-3). En los casos que toman levodopa les sigue unas tres cuartas partes que lo perciben como palpitante, tirante, punzante. En los casos que toman agonista dopaminergico lo perciben en un 75% como adormecimiento, interno, descarga electrica, frialdad y calor. El dolor en la EP respecto a su configuracion es multimodal. Los parametros neurofisiologicos estan relacionados con los umbrales de dolor. La actividad simpatica y la sensibilidad nociceptiva estan disminuidas en la EP. Los enfermos con EP tienen un umbral menor para el frio segun los datos del estudio del Cold-Ice. En lo referente a la terapeutica el tratamiento dopaminergico es eficaz para el control del dolor en el 48% de los pacientes mientras que el tratamiento analgesico estandar prescrito mejora el dolor en un 78,8%. Por ultimo, casi la mitad de la poblacion de nuestro estudio (47,52%) evaluada con la EQ-5D tiene problemas en alguna de las dimensiones de la calidad de vida. Hay una relacion positiva entre la escala analogica visual del dolor (EVA) y la EQ-5D que evalua la CVRS y entre la intensidad de dolor y la CVRS (r:-0,298; p < 0,01). Es decir, una mayor vivencia de dolor empeora la CVRS del paciente con EP. Conclusiones: En la enfermedad de Parkinson el dolor es un sintoma no motor de elevada prevalencia, intimamente relacionado con la afectacion de los sistemas afectivos y autonomicos medido con test neuro-vegetativos especificos. El presente estudio confirma su relacion con el lado mas afecto de la enfermedad, las fluctuaciones motoras, el tiempo de evolucion, con la situacion animica (depresion y ansiedad) y con el sexo femenino, asi como su caracter multimodal y gran variedad de expresion sintomatica. Es muy llamativa su asociacion con el deficit mnesico. Por ultimo esta vivencia repercute en forma llamativa en la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud por lo que seria importante conocer y manejar mejor estos aspectos de la enfermedad de Parkinson.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

Although it has been associated with many neurological and psychotic disorders, it has rarely been reported as the first and only symptom in patients with anxiety disorder, and its treatment remains inadequate. Case summary A 66-year-old woman who had been experiencing gradually worsening olfactory hallucinations for almost 4 years was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Olfactory hallucination disappeared after treatment with anti-anxiety drugs. Conclusion Olfactory hallucination can be the first and only symptom in patients with anxiety disorder and may be effectively treated with anti-anxiety medication. In fact, it can precede the diagnosis of anxiety disorder by several years.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

Patients with this condition may have fewer vegetative symptoms (appetite, diurnal mood variation) and more subjective symptoms (self-blame, worry, irritability, lethargy). Minor depressive disorder is more prevalent in primary care than major depressive disorder. Failure to adequately treat this condition may have far-reaching impact on the health, functional status, quality of life, and cost of care for patients who have it. The notion that minor depression requires minor treatment is misleading. Cognitive-behavioral modes of therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants have demonstrated efficacy for primary care patients who have minor depression.",

      "abstract": "Productive mental disorders (PMD) are the result of pathological mental activity. Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

Depressive features in Parkinson patients are very close to those of endogenous depression, except for a relative lack of anxiety, irritability, suicidal ideations, delusions and circadian rhythm. Pharmacotherapy with antidepressants is most reliable in the treatment of parkinsonian depressives, although levodopa or other antiparkinsonian drugs may relieve a depression. Hallucinatory complications of long-term antiparkinsonian treatment appear in two types of symptoms: (1) hallucinosis type – vivid visual hallucination and illusion with clear consciousness and well-preserved orientation, and (2) delirium type – less vivid visual hallucination and illusion with disturbed orientation and confusion. Antipsychotic drugs and 'drug holiday' are recommended for the management of hallucinations as side effects of antiparkinsonian drugs.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus (SE) is clinically defined as prolonged electrical and clinical seizure activity in which the patient does not regain consciousness to a normal alert state between repeated tonic-clonic attacks. The disorder is a neurological emergency associated with a mortality rate of 10-12% and an even greater morbidity. Seizures represent one of the most severe in vivo stimulatory stresses that the brain is exposed to and generalized status epilepticus represents a very severe form of seizures. The International Classification of Seizures has defined this condition as \"a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequent or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition\". During SE, high-amplitude, high-frequency electrical activity lasting at least 5 min is seen in the EEG. Continuous seizure activity in itself will result in progressive brain injury. The longer the condition of SE, the more difficult it is to control and the more likely it is to result in permanent neuronal damage. Therefore, SE is an emergency situation requiring prompt medical attention if severe permanent brain damage or death is to be prevented. SE often occurs in individuals with a history of seizures, in whom there are neural substrates already predisposed towards supporting seizure activity.",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

A apresentação deste caso clínico justifica-se pela incidência crescente deste diagnóstico e pela importância do reconhecimento atempado de fatores causais reversíveis para o mesmo, que permita a realização de tratamento dirigido e a minimização de complicações. Descrição do Caso: Homem de 70 anos, solteiro, ex-fumador, com antecedentes de alcoolismo e de comportamentos sexuais de risco. É trazido pela filha à consulta por um quadro com quatro anos de evolução de alteração comportamental, com episódios de heteroagressividade, discurso incoerente, perda progressiva de autonomia e autonegligência e descoordenação motora associada a alterações da marcha com quedas frequentes. Destaca-se a deteção, duas semanas antes da data da consulta, de lesão cutânea escrotal com 4x2cm de diâmetro e 2cm de espessura, de consistência elástica, indolor, ulcerada, compatível com goma sifilítica. Por suspeita de sífilis terciária é encaminhado para o serviço de urgência (SU), com posterior internamento e confirmação de neurossífilis, tendo cumprido terapêutica prolongada com penicilina endovenosa (EV), com melhoria do quadro neurológico. Três meses depois é reinternado por reativação de neurossífilis e medicado com penicilina, seguindo-se, após alta, um agravamento do seu estado clínico, com caquexia, diminuição global da força muscular mais evidente ao nível dos membros inferiores, disartria marcada e disfagia progressiva. Faleceu 11 meses depois, por pneumonia associada aos cuidados de saúde. Comentário: Neste caso clínico destaca-se a presença de uma causa potencialmente reversível de demência: neurossífilis. Após tratamento verificou-se uma melhoria parcial do quadro; contudo, sem completa recuperação e com posterior deterioração progressiva. Este aspeto justifica-se pelo diagnóstico tardio e pela presença concomitante de outros fatores etiológicos para a síndroma demencial. Pelo conhecimento dos antecedentes pessoais, do contexto sociofamiliar e do estado prévio do seu doente, o médico de família encontra-se numa posição privilegiada para o diagnóstico precoce e orientação destas situações.",

      "abstract": "A total of 775 patients with alcoholic delirium were examined. Alcoholic delirium was found to have undergone a certain pathomorphosis, manifesting in a more pronounced somatic pathology and less representative hallucinational symptomatology. A number of new variants of alcoholic delirium are presented along with the typical and previously described ones. These include: (a) short-term (within 24 hours) gross neurological symptomatology due to a transient impairment of the cerebral blood circulation following the toxic impact of alcohol on the cerebral vessels; (b) alcoholic delirium with a longer transient impairment of the cerebral blood circulation for as long as three months; (c) alcoholic delirium with prolonged subclinical symptomatology and a negligible effect on the patients' behaviour which is subsequently transformed into a sharp psychomotor excitement, epileptiform paroxysm, etc., and finally into a comatose state caused by brain edema. Treatment should be differential, with due regard for the severity of the disease, and aimed at the recovery of the normal sleep pattern, detoxification as well as prevention and control of grave somatic complications.",

Absence status epilepticus may be obtained during progress of many epileptic syndromes, in several metabolic disturbances and related to use of several drugs. Absence status epilepticus is generally seen in childhood; rarely it can be seen in adulthood. In this paper, the case which has never diagnosed until now in spite of many absence seizures for years, applied for absence seizures to our clinic and diagnosed for juvenile absence epilepsy, has been discussed.",

      "title": "A Case Study of Acute Stimulant-induced Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis resulting from stimulant overuse is commonly observed in clinical practices today. This is in large part due to the significant increase in attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in recent years, the increase in methamphetamine trafficking, and the prevalence of stimulant use in the day-to-day activities by many of those living in today's fast-paced society. The current inability to predict those users who will experience stimulant-induced psychosis from those users who will not needs further investigation. In this case study, we examine why one particular stimulant user experiences stimulant-induced psychosis. We give an account of a patient with an acute psychotic episode admitted to the emergency room at a local hospital. During initial evaluation, it was discovered that he had been diagnosed with ADHD one month ago and that the onset of his symptoms was likely related to an overuse of amphetamines. The patient had no personal history or family history of any psychiatric or mood disorders. He had no history of recreational drug use prior to this incident, and had no history of seizures or head trauma. After appropriate pharmacological intervention with antipsychotics and psychological intervention, the patient showed gradual improvement over the next five days of his hospitalization. After the five days, he was allowed to be discharged. We conclude with the cautionary advice that a patient's susceptibility of experiencing stimulant-induced psychosis should be assessed before prescribing stimulants. In cases where stimulant use is not supervised by a physician, appropriate understanding of management of stimulant-induced psychosis is of utmost importance in order to provide the very best patient education and care.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

      "title": "The role of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia outcome",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

      "title": "Galantamine in the Treatment of Minor Depression With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Dementia in an Elderly Woman",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Depression is present in about 20%–40% of dementia patients; 15%–50% of Alzheimer's dementia patients have depression.1,2 Depression is common in the early stages of the disease and remains fairly constant through most stages of Alzheimer's dementia.3 Depression exacerbates the cognitive deficits of the preexisting dementia. In Alzheimer's dementia, mild to moderate depression may also manifest as new onset of agitation, wandering, apathy, insomnia, or change in functional status. Depressive symptoms in dementia should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable “excess disability.”4\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, an 80-year-old woman, presented with a 2-year history of cognitive decline and an 8-month history of minor depression. Depression features included low mood with decreased interest in social activities, being less energetic, psychomotor slowing, and being more withdrawn and lonely. Sleep and appetite were good. She met only 3 of the 9 features of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Her Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)5 score was 11/30. Her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia6 score for depression in dementia was 13. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)7 score was 22/30, and she met the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's dementia. Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed generalized atrophy.\r\n\r\nMs A was started on galantamine 8 mg orally twice a day, which was subsequently increased to 16 mg orally twice a day after 4 weeks. Her minor depression features responded very well with galantamine monotherapy after 2 months. At that time, her MMSE score was 23/30, her GDS score was 4/30, and her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was 6.\r\n\r\nDepression is associated with defects of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, catecholamine, and acetylcholine. Depression in Alzheimer's dementia is linked to catecholaminergic deficit or degeneration of serotonergic neurons, and this process is also known to occur early in Alzheimer's dementia.8\r\n\r\nGalantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used in the treatment of dementia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist not only on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites but also on those located on axon terminals and are involved in the modulation of multiple neurotransmitter releases. Neuronal nAChR is a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are widely distributed in the brain and are controlled by acetylcholine and nicotine receptor agonists. In the genetically depressive rats, nicotine showed antidepressant-like effects through the involvement of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype. The α4 subunit in combination with the β2 subunit mediates dopaminergic and nonadrenergic release.9 Modulation of nAChR facilitates the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.10 Striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with high affinity for nicotinic agonists are involved with the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.11 Dopamine deficiency is associated with anhedonia, lack of interest, and psychomotor slowing (bradyphrenia), and it may arise as a consequence of cholinergic defects involving nAChR. Studies suggest galantamine in addition to mediating cholinergic neurotransmission also through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence several other neurotransmitter systems, possibly modulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA in certain nerve tracts.12,13 So, it is possible that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia, may also have some antidepressant effect.\r\n\r\nIf large studies prove this effect, we may not need to use an antidepressant in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients who have depression with dementia. This means less medication usage and potentially less adverse effect to these patients.",

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "One cannot but be struck with the fact that in many (if not in most) attacks of acute insanity the patient, on recovery, has no recollection of the incidents of the illness. She may have answered our questions in a way showing that at the time there was not only a consciousness of a certain kind present, but also the capacity for understanding and replying in accordance with her ideas (however unfounded they may, in fact, be), and yet on recovery, or even in a temporary lucid interval, all remembrance of the disordered state has passed away, and that, too, beyond the capacity of recall—nothing but a misty, hazy remembrance of some condition which has been passed through remains, just as one finds it impossible to re-instate the details of a dream, the reality of which was at the time vivid in consciousness. We have here to deal with a dual consciousness, a knowledge of states apparently incompatible with, and distinct from, each other. We are all familiar with states of acute mental disturbance where there is difficulty in making the patient understand what we are saying—not necessarily difficult or involved questions, but simple queries relating to what we think are matters in the patient‘s consciousness, such as it is. Here it is doubtful if the patients really understand what we are saying, though there is no doubt about their hearing the question, e.g. , they may hear the question but the reply will be merely the reiteration of some particular delusion which has no connection with the question, or there need not be any reply at all, as if we were addressing them in a foreign language which they did not understand, or as if what is said to them has a different meaning from what is intended.",

Resulta imperativo determinar desde el abordaje diagnóstico inicial si los signos y síntomas de la ansiedad constituyen una plena respuesta a situaciones de estrés, son manifestaciones de una patología somática subyacente, o se pueden explicar como síntomas de un trastorno psiquiátrico primario específico. En el momento actual, la pandemia de COVID-19 –en la que el Perú ha llegado a tener la mayor tasa de mortalidad mundial-- desborda los servicios de salud con abigarrados cuadros en los que se combinan tanto los síntomas de la infección viral por sí misma, como los de reacciones ansiosas y respuestas al estrés. A propósito de un caso ilustrativo, en el que el proceso de tamizaje médico fue deficitario y se etiquetó al paciente como un caso primario de “ansiedad”, con un desenlace lamentablemente ominoso, se revisa brevemente la literatura acerca del proceso de medical clearance (o descarte de condiciones médicas) y se reafirma concluyentemente la importancia de una consideración diagnóstica inicial abarcadora, no sesgada, y basada en criterios clínicos sólidamente elaborados y sustentados. Es evidente, por otro lado, que el psiquiatra requiere estar permanentemente actualizado sobre las formas de presentación psicopatológica asociadas a la sintomatología de COVID-19.",

On a purely descriptive basis, delusions may be complex or simple, transient or persistent, relatively compartmentalized or elaborate and intricately woven into the individual's view of reality. The content of delusions varies from patient to patient, and this content may or may not be congruent with the individual's mood. The delusions of individuals with dementia are most often paranoid or persecutory; they are also simple, as a high level of cognitive functioning seems to be required in order to elaborate complex delusions. Hallucinations are perceptions that occur without corresponding, external stimuli. Hallucinations commonly occur in the context of a waxing and waning clouding of consciousness—as part of a delirium.",

Clinically the disorder was characterised by long periods of clouding of consciousness with myoclonic phenomena of varying degrees of severity. The EEGs showed sustained spike-wave, polyspike and rhythmic slow activity. In one exceptional patient bizarre hemitonic seizures were documented clinically and on EEG. Diagnosis of the condition was frequently delayed and the histories of most patients showed episodes of obscure confusional behaviour, undiagnosed over the previous months or years. Psychiatric disturbances of various types were surprisingly common, contributing to diagnostic difficulty. Treatment with conventional anticonvulsants was often disappointing. In contrast, sodium valproate and clonazepam were found to be very effective.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Although the condition is among the commonest seen in many of our clinics and practices, it remains without a generally accepted diagnostic form. It is suggested that the essential, clinical, dynamic, and structural features of the depressive character are: (1) consistently low self-esteem and a sense of helplessness, dependent object relations and chronic guilt; (2) self-directed aggression and masochism are frequent but not invariable; (3) extensive use of the mechanism of denial is as common as the previously described obsessional defenses seen in patients subject to psychotic depression; (4) often the depressive character suffers from intense oral envy; (5) depressive character traits may help to ward off any of the basic anxieties, namely, object loss, loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety (guilt) (6) the depressive character may be similar to a number of related disorders, namely, the obsessional character, hysterical characters with a large oral component, and depressive borderline states; (7) sensitivity to loss, sadness, and fragility of self-esteem makes the depressive character especially vulnerable to regression into overt depression; (8) the persistence of oral incorporative mechanisms, ambivalent, dependent object relations, ego versus superego tension with depressive affect, and sensitivity to loss are characteristic of the ego of the depressive character.",

      "title": "Place du syndrome confusionnel en psychiatrie : une revue de littérature",
      "abstract": "Ce travail est une revue de litterature sur la place du delirium en psychiatrie. Le delirium (ou confusion ou syndrome confusionnel) est une affection neuropsychiatrique reconnue dans le DSM5 et la CIM-lO. Il est caracterise par une apparition brutale, une fluctuation clinique importante, des troubles de la cognition et de la vigilance. Selon le degre d'excitation psychomotrice, differentes formes de syndrome confusionnel sont distinguees dans la litterature actuelle : hypoactive, hyperactive ou mixte. Le trouble affecte preferentiellement les sujets âges, vulnerables du fait d'un grand nombre de facteurs de risque predisposants. H est frequemment sous diagnostique, touchant 14 a 24% de la population generale hospitaliere au moment de son admission. Il est associe a un mauvais pronostic, evoluant frequemment vers la demence, avec une mortalite elevee. Son etude est compliquee par sa fluctuation symptomatique, la variete de ses formes, la diversite de ses facteurs precipitants, et la difficile distinction entre les effets du trouble en lui-meme et ceux de ses etiologies. Malgre cela, des outils standardises (comme la CAM) existent permettant une demarche diagnostique rationnelle. Des biomarqueurs tels que la CRP et l'hemoglobinemie pourraient participer a l'evaluation du trouble mais ils sont cependant non specifiques. Le delirium semble pouvoir beneficier d'un traitement qui lui est propre : outre les mesures de prevention non-medicamenteuses, les neuroleptiques a dose relativement faibles, et peut etre la melatonine, pourraient etre efficaces quelle que soit l'etiologie. La physiopathologie du delirium est complexe mais semble caracterisee par une voie metabolique finale commune associant le plus souvent et principalement une hyperdopaminergie, un deficit en acethyl-choline et une hyperglutamatergie. Ce dernier mecanisme pourrait expliquer la neurotoxicite du syndrome confusionnel et son pronostic mediocre sur le plan cognitif. D'autres phenomenes, inflammatoires ou neuroendocriniens, pourraient etre aussi impliques. Cette revue de litterature amene a differentes conclusions et constatations : • Le delirium malgre sa complexite clinique, est une entite certes transnosographique, mais qui a une reelle coherence, tant sur le plan semiologique, que neurobiologique ou bien encore genetique. • Le delirium se rattache aux pathologies habituellement prises en charge en psychiatrie, par sa clinique, ses traitements, sa physiopathologie, sa genetique, mais il s'en distingue par ses facteurs precipitants. • La litterature scientifique actuelle n'apporte que peu d'elements sur la realite de « confusions psychiatriques » et sur l'interet d'une prise en charge psychiatrique de la confusion. ▪ Les troubles psychiatriques pourraient etre integres au modele general de vulnerabilite du delirium. Loin de lever l'ambiguite qui associe historiquement le syndrome confusionnel a la psychiatrie, ce travail amene a souhaiter sur le sujet, une meilleure diffusion dans le corps medical des connaissances, et un renforcement de l'interdisciplinarite des soins. Cette revue de la litterature a ouvert la voie a d'autres etudes qui pourraient par exemple comparer l'impact pronostic des patients confus en psychiatrie et en services conventionnels de soins.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, frequent, heterogeneous, longlasting and disabling chronic mental illness with high social impact, belonging to the group of chronic psychoses. There are several clinical forms and several possible evolutionary modes. Its etiopathogenesis is multifactorial (hereditary, biological, environmental, etc.) but no single cause has been demonstrated up till now. Schizophrenia is a group of disabling heterogeneous disorders that are generally severe, the course of which is chronic and disabling, and the prognosis is poor. Many retrospective studies have attempted to trace the premorbid history of adult subjects who developed schizophrenia. Their results appear to be extremely disparate, due in particular to the heterogeneity of the means of investigation used. In addition, in recent years, many studies have focused on prodromal symptoms occurring during the year preceding the first psychotic episode in late adolescence or early adulthood. Minor physical cranio-cerebral (at the level of the ears, the palate, the cranial perimeter), temporomandibular, dental and palatal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic disturbances or even subtle neurological signs have been frequently found in schizophrenic patients, in particular oral anomalies, more precisely the measurements of the teeth, their vestibulo-lingual and mesio-distal diameters. The objective of our article is to study the morphological abnormalities that exist in the patient with schizophrenia, and to demonstrate whether there is a link between the presence of these physical abnormalities and the occurrence of schizophrenia. This issue has been vaguely mentioned in the literature, but in the Moroccan context, it is a pilot study.",
